# In Code
## Code
[] Create a docstring for every class and function
[] Add error handling 
[] Add testing for each Extractor, or other class 

## Model:
[] Add type validation to conversion of the text input 
[] Add fit_partial function


# Auxiliary
## Documentation
[] Create a directory description by explaining every file
[] Generate docs html (probably sphinx) for the guide on how to introduce more extractors or extend given extractors
[] Generate UML class diagram for the Adapter classes

## Readme
[] Mention link to rest api
[] Mention link to documentation
[] Include image for the UML architecture
[] Include image to processing diagram


## Considerations
[] For evaluation, I use measure micro and macro metrics. Hence, all predictions across documents (flattened) and per document average (each doc metric)
