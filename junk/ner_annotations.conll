The O

concerns O

Tpoxx O
is O
approved O
in O
the O
European B-LOC

to O
treat O
monkeypox O

It O
can O
be O
taken O
intravenously O

more O
commonly O
as O
an O
oral O

Tpoxx O
is O
considered O
experimental O
when O
it O
comes O

monkeypox O
treatment O
because O
there’s O
no O
data O
to O
prove O
its O
effectiveness O
against O
the O

Its O
safety O
was O

As O
the O

increases O
demand O

the O

, O
the O
FDA B-ORG

recently O
eased O
some O
of O
the O
administrative O

that O
health O

However O
, O
doctors O

about O
20% O

the O

Anecdotally O
, O
of O
the O

that O
we’ve O
spoken O
to O

we’ve O
seen O
, O
very O

significant O

just O
a O
few O
days O

improvements O
in O

And O
very O
significantly O
we O
have O
not O
seen O
any O

very O
few O
even O
mild O

Some O

that’s O
pretty O
much O
it O

However O
, O
it’s O
unclear O
what O
proportion O
of O
the O
more O
than O
5,000 O
probable O

confirmed O
cases O
nationwide O
have O
been O
treated O

CDC B-ORG

that O
more O

the O

did O
not O
respond O
to O

a O
more O

Experts O
say O
the O
number O
who’ve O
been O

probably O
a O
fraction O

I O
think O
a O

don’t O
have O

Chin-Hong B-PER

Kevin B-PER
Kwong I-PER

34 O
, O
after O
he O
developed O
painful O
lesions O
all O
over O
his O
hands O
, O
feet O
and O
face O
that O
spread O
to O
his O
back O
, O
thighs O
and O
scalp O
. O

There O
were O
moments O
I O
could O
barely O
swallow O
food O
because O
of O
the O
sores O
in O
the O
back O
of O
my O
throat O
, O
Kwong B-PER
said O
. O

Lesions O
near O
his O
eye O
threatened O
to O
have O
long-term O
effects O
on O
his O
vision O

But O
after O
his O
symptoms O
began O
, O
it O
took O
about O
five O
days O
for O
Kwong B-PER
to O
get O
to O
a O
facility O
where O
he O
could O
get O
Tpoxx O
. O

He O
spent O
four O
days O
doing O
telehealth O
visits O
and O
going O
to O
urgent O
cares O
and O
emergency O
rooms O
as O
his O
rash O
worsened O
before O
doctors O
finally O
suspected O
monkeypox O
– O
and O
even O
then O
he O
says O
, O
they O
didn’t O
know O
how O
to O
treat O
him O
and O
sent O
him O
home O

But O
his O
symptoms O
only O
got O
worse O
, O
and O
he O
went O
back O
to O
the O
ER O
before O
being O
advised O
to O
go O
to O
the O
UCSF B-ORG
Medical I-ORG
Center I-ORG
because O
it O
was O
treating O
monkeypox O
patients O
. O

Exhausted O
and O
frustrated O
he O
agreed O
out O
of O
desperation O

He O
got O
there O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
; O
several O
hours O
later O
, O
he O
met O
Chin-Hong B-PER
and O
took O
his O
first O
dose O
of O
Tpoxx O
. O

He O
had O
to O
push O
through O
and O
get O
to O
a O
county O
that O
has O
Tpoxx O
and O
go O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
in O
the O
hospital O
he O
knew O
might O
offer O
him O
therapy O
because O
the O
place O
where O
he O
comes O
from O
doesn’t O
have O
therapy O
, O
Chin-Hong B-PER
said O
. O

If O
he O
didn’t O
advocate O
for O
himself O
, O
he O
would O
have O
never O
gotten O
Tpoxx O
. O

To O
get O
Tpoxx O
, O
a O
patient O
must O
sign O
a O
consent O
form O
from O
the O
CDC B-ORG
, O
and O
doctors O
must O
request O
access O
from O
the O
CDC B-ORG
or O
their O
local O
health O
department O
, O
which O
involves O
submitting O
things O
like O
lab O
tests O
and O
consent O
forms O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
and O
the O
FDA B-ORG
recently O
reduced O
the O
amount O
of O
paperwork O
needed O
, O
made O
certain O
tests O

photo O
requirements O
optional O
, O
and O
allowed O
health-care O
workers O
to O
start O
treatment O
before O
paperwork O
is O
submitted O
. O

They O
have O
made O
it O
easier O
, O
but O
it O
still O
requires O
additional O
time O
, O
efforts O
and O
resources O
to O
be O
able O
to O
prescribe O
it O

Chin-Hong B-PER
says O
that O
aside O
from O
the O
paperwork O
, O
there’s O
a O
high O
“activation O
energy” O
that O
clinics O
and O
hospitals O
face O
because O
the O
drug O
is O
considered O
experimental O
for O
monkeypox O
and O
some O
hospitals O
and O
institutions O
require O
additional O
reviews O
for O
such O
treatments O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Tpoxx O
has O
been O
disproportionately O
used O
in O
larger O
academic O
medical O
centers O
that O
have O
better O
infrastructure O
for O
working O
through O
such O
processes O
. O

We O
have O
this O
interesting O
situation O
– O
and O
it O
was O
like O
that O
in O
Covid O
too O
– O
where O
a O
county O
that O
doesn’t O
have O
Tpoxx O
will O
negotiate O
with O
another O
county O
and O
the O
hospital O
to O
take O
the O
patient O
if O
they O
are O
still O
ill O
and O
would O
need O
Tpoxx O
. O

So O
we O
may O
get O
another O
patient O
like O
that O
from O
another O
county O

Irving B-ORG

Zucker B-PER
says O
the O
process O
of O
prescribing O
Tpoxx O
involves O
weighing O
the O
risks O

benefits O
for O
each O
person O
. O

Although O
some O
doctors O
have O
reported O
cases O
in O
which O
they O
think O
the O
drug O
may O
have O
been O
beneficial O
, O
the O
CDC B-ORG
says O
that O
evidence O
of O
how O
well O
it O
works O
in O

has O
been O
limited O
to O
“drug O
levels O
in O

and O
“a O
few O

studies.” O

Tpoxx’s O
safety O
was O
assessed O
through O
a O
study O
of O
359 O
healthy O
people O
before O
it O
got O
FDA B-ORG
approval O

Because O
smallpox O
has O
been O
eradicated O
since O
1980 O
, O
the O
drug’s O
benefits O
were O
evaluated O
through O
trials O

There O
is O
no O

prove O
that O
it’s O
effective O
in O

Any O
time O
that O
we’re O
using O
a O
new O
medication O
, O
it’s O
important O
that O
we O
do O
randomized O

really O
the O
only O
way O

we O

challenges O
of O

and O
clinical O
data O
to O
the O
early O
days O
of O

The O
unfortunate O
parallel O
is O
that O
the O
US B-LOC

behind O
the O

running O
these O

for O
his O
role O

at O
the O
US B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC
and O
“the O
facts O

there,” O
the O

call O

whether O

In O
an O

Cheney B-PER
– O
the O

committee O
investigating O
the O
events O
surrounding O
the O
January B-LOC

– O
said O
Trump B-PER
is O
“ O

” O
and O
pointed O
to O
a O

She O
said O
the O

“going O
to O
continue O
to O
follow O
the O

I O
think O
Department B-ORG

will O
do O
that O

But O
they O
have O
to O
make O
decisions O
about O

Understanding O
what O
it O
means O
if O
the O

how O
do O
we O
then O
call O
ourselves O

I O
think O
that’s O
a O
very O
serious O
, O
serious O
balancing O
, O
” O
Cheney B-PER
said O
. O

The O
question O
for O
us O
is O
, O
are O
we O
a O
nation O
of O

Are O
we O
a O
country O
where O
no O
one O

above O
the O

And O
what O
do O
the O
facts O
and O
the O

show O
? O

Cheney B-PER
said O

She O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
whether O
Trump B-PER
being O
prosecuted O
by O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
’s O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
would O
only O
add O
to O
his O
strength O
with O
the O
Republican B-ORG

’s O
base O
ahead O
of O
the O
2024 O
presidential O
bid O
that O
Trump B-PER
has O
repeatedly O
teased O
. O

I O
don’t O
think O
that O
it’s O
appropriate O
to O
think O
about O
it O
that O
way O
, O
said O
Cheney B-PER
, O
who’s O
facing O
a O
Trump B-PER

She O
alluded O
to O

writing O
in O

that O

“ O

that O

to O
obstruct O

on O
January O
6 O

I O
think O
he’s O
guilty O
of O
the O
most O
serious O
dereliction O
of O
duty O
of O
any O
president O
in O
our O
nation’s O
history O
,” O
Cheney B-PER
said O
of O
Trump B-PER
. O

You’ve O
had O
a O
federal O
judge O
in O
California B-LOC
say O
that O
it’s O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
that O
he O
and O
John B-PER
Eastman I-PER
committed O
two O
crimes O
. O

Cheney’s B-PER
comments O

as O
the O

A O

a O

lays O
into O
Trump B-PER
over O
his O
lies O
about O
widespread O
fraud O
in O
the O

He O
tried O
to O
steal O
the O

and O
violence O
to O
keep O
himself O
in O
power O
after O
the O

in O
the O
spot O

“ O

He O
is O
a O
coward O

real O
man O
wouldn’t O
lie O
to O

He O
lost O
his O

and O
he O
lost O
big O

I O
know O
it O
, O
he O
knows O
it O
and O
, O
deep O
down O
, O
I O
think O
most O
Republicans O
know O
it O

Dick B-PER

Liz B-PER
Cheney I-PER
wouldn’t O
say O
whether O
her O

urged O
her O

Look, O
Dick B-PER
Cheney I-PER
is O
a O
big O
Liz B-PER

supporter,” O
she O
said. O

She O
said O
the O
former O

president O
shares O
“this O
real O
sadness O
, O
frankly O
, O
about O
what’s O
happening O
to O
our O
party O

and O
a O
real O
despair O
about O
how O
it O
could O
be O
that O
so O
many O
Republicans O
would O
refuse O
to O
stand O
up O
and O
tell O
the O
truth O

” O

And O
it O
is O
a O
scary O
moment O
for O
the O
nation O
,” O
she O
added O
. O

Cheney B-PER
says O
more O
to O
come O
from O
the O
committee O
this O
fall O
Liz B-PER
Cheney I-PER
, O
who O
has O
courted O
Democratic O
voters O
in O
Wyoming’s B-LOC
primary O
, O
said O
she O
doesn’t O
see O
the O
House O
committee’s O
work O
through O
the O
lens O
of O
political O
outcomes O

Cheney B-PER
said O
the O
House B-ORG
panel O
will O
continue O
to O
lay O
out O
evidence O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
and O
that O
she O
expects O
the O
committee O
to O
“have O
an O
opinion” O
about O
making O
criminal O
referrals O
to O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
. O

There’s O
much O
more O
that O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
shared O
in O
hearings O
and O
that O
we O
anticipate O
we O
will O
share O
in O
the O
fall O
,” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

And O
we O
will O
also O
make O
decisions O
about O
criminal O
referrals O

And O
ultimately O
, O
the O
decision O
about O
prosecution’s O
up O
to O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
. O

But O
I O
would O
anticipate O
that O
the O
committee O
will O
have O
an O
opinion O
on O
it O
.” O

Cheney B-PER
said O
that O
during O
the O
committee’s O
probe O
, O
she O
has O
learned O
that O
Trump’s B-PER
effort O
to O
block O
the O
2020 O
election O
results O
were O
“ O
a O
more O
sophisticated O
and O
broader-reaching O
effort O
than O
I O
understood O
coming O
into O
it O
. O
” O

I O
think O
all O
of O
us O
on O
the O
committee O
have O
had O
that O
same O
reaction O
, O
which O
is O
that O
there’s O
so O
much O
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
more O
that O
was O
happening O
in O
multiple O
different O
areas O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
pressure O
on O
state O
officials O
or O
the B-ORG
Justice I-ORG
Department I-ORG
or O
efforts O
to O
push O
former O
Vice O
President O
Mike B-PER
Pence I-PER
to O
reject O
some O
states’ O
electoral O
votes O
. O

“The O
volume O
of O
information O
has O
been O
more O
than O
I O
expected,” O
she O
said. O

Cheney B-PER
praised O
Pence B-PER
for O
rejecting O
the O
pressure O
from O
Trump B-PER
. O

She O
said O
Pence B-PER
, O
who O
, O
as O
vice O
president O
oversaw O
the O
session O
of O
Congress B-ORG
in O
which O
electoral O
votes O
were O
officially O
counted O
, O
“ O
was O
a O
hero O
on O
January O
6 O
.” O

It’s O
very O
clear O
that O
there O
was O
tremendous O
pressure O
from O
a O
number O
of O
different O
places O
on O
him O

And O
he O
did O
his O
duty O
and O
he O
didn’t O
succumb O
to O
that O
pressure O
and O
if O
he O
had O
succumbed O
to O
that O
pressure O
, O
things O
would O
have O
been O
very O
different O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

And O
so O
I O
think O
that O
that O
we O
owe O
him O
gratitude O
for O
how O
he O
conducted O
himself O
and O
for O
his O
refusal O
to O
do O
what O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
wanted O
him O
to O
do O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
illegal O
. O

Cheney B-PER
faces O
voters O
on O
August O
16 O
Cheney B-PER
said O
she O
expects O
to O
win O
her O
primary O
in O
less O
than O
two O
weeks O
, O
despite O
her O
opponents O
attacking O
her O
role O
on O
the O
committee O

I O
don’t O
expect O
to O
lose O

I’m O
working O
hard O
to O
earn O
every O
single O
vote O
and O
, O
ultimately O
, O
I O
really O
believe O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Wyoming B-LOC
fundamentally O
understand O
how O
important O
fidelity O
to O
the O
Constitution O
is O
; O
understand O
how O
important O
it O
is O
that O
we O
fight O
for O
those O
fundamental O
principles O
on O
which O
everything O
else O
is O
based O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O

However O
, O
the O
congresswoman O
also O
made O
clear O
that O
she O
is O
not O
tempering O
her O
criticism O
of O
Trump B-PER
at O
all O
– O
even O
if O
it O
costs O
her O
the O
House O
seat O
that O
her O
father O
held O
and O
that O
she O
has O
held O
since O
2017 O
. O

We’re O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
former O
President O
Trump B-PER
has O
betrayed O
the O
patriotism O
of O
millions O
and O
millions O
of O
people O
across O
our O
country O
, O
and O
many O
people O
here O
in O
Wyoming B-LOC
, O
and O
he’s O
lied O
to O
them O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

And O
what O
I O
know O
to O
do O
is O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O

and O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
people O
understand O
the O
truth O
about O
what O
happened O
and O
why O
it O
matters O
so O
much O
. O

Asked O
why O
she O
thinks O
voters O
believe O
Trump B-PER
, O
Cheney B-PER
added O
: O
“ O
It’s O
just O
consistent O
lying O
about O
what O
happened O
about O
the O
election O
, O
playing O
on O
people’s O
patriotism O
. O

And O
he’s O
so O
dangerous O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
my O
view O
is O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
if O
defending O
the O
Constitution O
against O
the O
threat O
that O
he O
poses O
means O
losing O
a O
House O
seat O
, O
then O
that’s O
a O
sacrifice O
that O
I’m O
willing O
to O
make O
. O

I O
don’t O
intend O
to O
lose O

But O
some O
things O
are O
more O
important O
than O
any O
individual O
office O
or O
political O
campaign O
. O

Cheney B-PER
would O
not O
discuss O
her O
political O
plans O
after O
this O
month’s O
primary O
. O

But O
she O
said O
she O
will O
do O
“whatever O
is O
necessary” O
to O
keep O
Trump B-PER
from O
becoming O
the O
GOP B-ORG
presidential O
nominee O
for O
a O
third O
consecutive O
election O
in O
2024 O

She O
said O
she O
intends O
to O
be O
“ O
a O
big O
part O

making O
sure O
that O
we O
protect O

” O
from O
Trump B-PER

whether O
she O
wins O

Cheney B-PER
also O
urged O
members O

to O
band O
against O
GOP O
candidates O

have O
advanced O
Trump’s B-PER
lies O
about O

the O

I O
don’t O
think O
anybody O
should O
vote O

Cheney B-PER
said O

She O
cast O
defeating O
those O

critical O
to O
stopping O

circumventing O
the O
will O
of O
American B-LOC
voters O
if O
he O
is O
nominated O
for O
president O
in O

I O
think O
we O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
we O
come O
together O
and O
form O
alliances O
across O
party O
lines O

to O
make O
sure O
that O

not O
going O
to O
unravel O

” O
she O

Cheney B-PER
lambasted O
Democrats O
for O
meddling O
in O

they O

“terrible.” O

All O

so O
I O
think O
that O
it’s O
inexplicable O

wrong O
for O

make O
this O
an O

the O

Milwaukee B-LOC
Mayor O
Cavalier B-PER
Johnson I-PER

a O

defended O
the O
decision O
to O
host O
the O

his O
city O
, O
telling O
CNN B-ORG
the O
move O
“ O

” O
Milwaukee B-LOC
is O
“ O
signing O
up O
for O
the O
platform O
of O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

My O
stance O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
most O
Democrats O
understand O
this O
, O
is O
that O
this O
is O
not O
a O
political O
decision O
, O
it O
is O
a O
business O
decision O
, O
” O
Johnson B-PER

It O
will O
present O
an O
opportunity O
for O
us O
to O
have O
millions O
of O

of O
economic O
impact O
… O
for O
us O
to O
fill O
our O
restaurants O
, O
our O
bars O
, O
our O
hotels O
, O
and O
to O
support O
our O

industry O
that’s O
been O
battered O
by O
Covid O
, O
of O

, O
over O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

Johnson O
joined O
McDaniel B-PER
Friday O
to O
officially O
unveil O
Milwaukee B-LOC
as O
the O
convention O
site O
choice O
, O
just O
days O
after O
Nashville B-LOC
fell O
out O
of O
contention O
as O
a O
potential O
alternative O
. O

Milwaukee B-LOC
began O
its O
bid O
to O
be O
a O
convention O
host O
nearly O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
and O
city O
representatives O
met O
with O
RNC B-ORG
officials O
in O
February O
as O
they O
toured O
finalist O
cities O
, O
which O
included O
Salt B-LOC
Lake I-LOC
City I-LOC

Pittsburgh B-LOC
at O
the O
time O
. O

Both O
cities O
were O
later O
removed O
from O
the O

Later O
Friday O
, O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
is O
scheduled O
to O
host O
a O
rally O
in O
the O
Milwaukee B-LOC
suburb O
of O
Waukesha B-LOC
to O
campaign O
for O
Tim B-PER
Michels I-PER
, O
the O
GOP O
candidate O
for O
governor O
, O
ahead O
of O
the O
state’s O
primary O
next O
week O
. O

Trump’s B-PER
sustained O
popularity O
with O
the O
GOP B-ORG
base O
would O
likely O
position O
him O
as O
a O
front-runner O
in O
a O
crowded O
2024 O
GOP B-ORG
primary O
should O
he O
launch O
another O
presidential O
campaign O
, O
as O
is O
widely O
expected O

Johnson O
, O
who O
said O
he O
will O
actively O
campaign O
for O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
’s O
reelection O
in O
2024 O
, O
dismissed O
security O
concerns O
about O
protests O
around O
the O
convention O
in B-LOC
Milwaukee I-LOC

including O
if O
Trump B-PER
– O
one O
of O
the O
most O
polarizing O
figures O
in O
American B-LOC
politics O
– O
is O
the O
Republican B-ORG
nominee O
. O

I O
think O
that O
any O
time O
you O
host O
a O
large-scale O
event O
, O
there O
is O
potential O
for O
that O
sort O
of O
activity O
. O

Our O
police O
department O
is O
well-versed O

and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
prepared O
for O
the O

” O
Johnson B-PER

that O
Milwaukee B-LOC

originally O
supposed O
to O

the O
2020 O
Democratic B-ORG
National I-ORG
Convention I-ORG
before O
it O
switched O
to O
a O
virtual O
format O
amid O
the O

pandemic O
. O

The O
police O
in O
Milwaukee B-LOC

already O
well O
prepared O
for O
this O
and O
will O
really O
be O
in O
a O

It’s O
a O
make-or-break O
week O
for O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden’s I-PER
agenda O

The O
deal O
on O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
that O
Senate O
Majority O
Leader O
Chuck B-PER
Schumer I-PER
and O
Sen. O
Joe B-PER
Manchin I-PER
announced O
last O
week O
has O
a O
narrow O
window O
to O
navigate O
both O
chambers O
of O
Congress O
and O
land O
on O
the O
President’s O
desk O
before O
August O
recess O

And O
with O
the O
shock O
of O
the O
deal’s O
announcement O
wearing O
off O
, O
GOP O
opposition O
, O
public O
scrutiny O
, O
and O
Democrats’ O
slim O
majorities O
will O
all O
have O
a O
say O
in O
whether O
the O
legislation O
is O
a O
breakthrough O
or O
a O
bust O
. O

Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill O
? O

The O
agreement O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ B-ORG
goals O
, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years O
: O
What’s O
not O
in O
the O
bill O
? O

To O
be O
clear O
, O
this O
isn’t O
Build O
Back O
Better O
2.0 O
. O

The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
key O
Democratic O
priorities O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
left O
out O
, O
including O
: O
What O
are O
Republicans B-ORG
saying O
? O

The O
package O
, O
as O
it O
stands O
, O
is O
facing O
furious O
GOP B-ORG
opposition O
. O

Republican O
lawmakers O
on O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Finance I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
released O
data O
from O
the O
nonpartisan O
Joint B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on O
Taxation I-ORG
that O
showed O
that O
Americans B-LOC
of O
all O
incomes O
would O
see O
their O
federal O
taxes O
rise O
under O
the O
climate O
and O
health O
care O
package O

That O
analysis O
, O
however O
, O
looked O
at O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
the O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
provision O
on O
corporations O
. O

Economists O
assume O
companies O
would O
then O
pass O
along O
part O
of O
their O
tax O
increase O
to O
employees O
by O
reducing O
their O
after-tax O
wages O
and O
job O
opportunities O

Also, O
shareholders O
would O
take O
a O
hit O
since O
the O
value O
of O
their O
stock O
holdings, O
including O
those O
held O
in O
pensions O
and O
mutual O
funds, O
would O
likely O
decline. O

What’s O
Biden B-PER
saying? O

The O
President O
has O
urged O
congressional O
Democrats O
to O
quickly O
pass O
the O
surprise O
agreement O
“for O
America B-LOC
.” O

This O
bill O
is O
far O
from O
perfect O
. O

It’s O
a O
compromise O

But O
it’s O
often O
how O
progress O
is O
made O
, O
by O
compromises O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
my O
message O
to O
Congress B-ORG
is O
this O
: O
This O
is O
the O
strongest O
bill O
you O
can O
pass O
to O
lower O
inflation O
, O
cut O
the O
deficit O
, O
reduce O
health O
care O
costs O
, O
tackle O
the O
climate O
crises O
and O
promote O
energy O
security O
– O
all O
the O
time O
while O
reducing O
the O
burdens O
facing O
working-class O
and O
middle-class O
families O
, O
” O
Biden B-PER
said O
during O
a O
speech O
at O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
the O
day O
after O
the O
deal O
was O
announced O
. O

What’s O
the O
timeline O
? O

The O
health O
and O
climate O
bill O
stands O
a O
serious O
chance O
of O
becoming O
law O
as O
soon O
as O
August B-LOC
, O
assuming O
it O
passes O
muster O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian O
to O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
approved O
along O
straight O
party O
lines O
in O
the O
budget O
process O
– O
and O
all O
Democrats O
vote O
for O
it O
( O
more O
on O
that O
below O
( O
– O
and O
that O
the O
House B-ORG
passes O
it O
. O

Democrats O
need O
all O
50 O
of O
their O
senators O
to O
be O
present O
and O
vote O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
Vice O
President O
Kamala B-PER
Harris I-PER
casting O
the O
tie-breaking O
vote O
, O
as O
all O
Republicans O
are O
expected O
to O
vote O
against O
the O
deal O
. O

Manchin B-PER
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Jake B-PER
Tapper I-PER
on O
“State B-ORG
of O
the O
Union” I-ORG
Sunday O
he O
hopes O
the O
legislation O
passes O
before O
the O
August O
recess. O

I O
think O
it’s O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
legislation O
and O
on O
normal O
times O
, O
my O
Republican O
colleagues O
would O
be O
for O
something O
such O
as O
this O
. O

We’ve O
basically O
paid O
down O
debt O
, O
(which) O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O

We’ve O
accelerated O
permitting O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O

And O
we’ve O
increased O
production O
of O
energy O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O

We’ve O
done O
things O
that O
we O
should O
be O
doing O
together O
,” O
Manchin B-PER
said O
. O

Will O
Democrats B-ORG
be O
united O
? O

All O
eyes O
in O
Washington B-LOC
are O
on O
Arizona B-LOC
Democratic O
Sen. O
Kyrsten B-PER
Sinema I-PER
, O
a O
key O
moderate O
, O
who O
has O
not O
yet O
weighed O
in O
on O
the O
bill O
. O

She O
has O
previously O
raised O
concerns O
about O
taxes O
on O
carried O
interest O
, O
which O
would O
raise O
$14 O
billion O
under O
the O
deal O
. O

Sinema B-PER
was O
not O
part O
of O
negotiations O
for O
the O
current O
package O

Asked O
about O
getting O
the O
support O
of O
his O
Arizona B-LOC
colleague O
, O
Manchin B-PER
said O
on O
Sunday O
, O
“ O
We O
work O
very O
close O
together O
on O
so O
many O
things O
, O
and O
she O
has O
so O
much O
in O
this O
piece O
of O
legislation O
. O
” O

She’s O
formed O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
and O
worked O
on O
it O
very O
hard O
. O
“ O
“ O

I O
think O
that O
basically O
when O
she O
looks O
at O
the O
bill O
and O
sees O
the O
whole O
spectrum O
of O
what O
we’re O
doing O
… O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
positive O
about O
it O
, O
but O
she’ll O
make O
her O
decision O
and O
I O
respect O
that O
, O
” O

added O
