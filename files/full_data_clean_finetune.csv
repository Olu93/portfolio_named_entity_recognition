587,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/senate-democrats-health-care-climate-bill-vote/,"""articleBody"":""The Senate has worked through the night and into Sunday morning, taking a series of back-to-back amendment votes that are among the last steps toward final passage of Democrats’ sweeping health care and climate bill – putting the package on track to be approved by the chamber as soon as this weekend. The process is known on Capitol Hill as a “vote-a-rama,” and started Saturday night shortly after 11:30 p.m. ET, and which is expected to stretch well into Sunday. A vote on final passage of the bill will take place when amendment votes end, the timing of which it is not yet clear. The bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would impose new taxes to pay for it. The package is the product of painstaking negotiations and will give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. Senate Democrats are using a special process to pass the package without Republican votes.  Once the legislation has passed in the Senate, it would next need to be approved by the House of Representatives before President Joe Biden could sign it into law.  What happens next  Following the procedural vote to proceed to the bill, the Senate entered debate before moving into the “vote-a-rama.” The marathon series of amendment votes with no time limit must run its course before a final vote can take place.  Republicans are using the “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes, and votes on contentious policy issues are expected.  As expected, key insulin provisions were struck out of the bill after Republicans raised a point of order, resulting in a vote to strip them out. The final vote was 57-43. A 60-vote threshold was needed to keep the provision in place.  The provisions initially included in the bill would have limited insulin prices to $35 per month in both the private insurance market as well as through Medicare. But the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the cap on insulin in the private insurance market was not compliant with the reconciliation rules Democrats are utilizing to push their legislation through the chamber.  Democrats kept both provisions in the bill anyway, but Republicans raised a point of order to force a vote to strike the provisions only from the private marketplace. The Medicare $35 insulin cap remains in place. The House is poised to come back to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer’s office.  How Democrats plan to pass the sweeping legislation  Senate Democrats only need a simple majority for final passage of the bill since they are using a process known as reconciliation, which allows them to avoid a Republican filibuster and corresponding 60-vote threshold.  In order to pass a bill through the reconciliation process, however, the package must comply with a strict set of budget rules.  The Senate parliamentarian has to decide whether the provisions in the bill meet the rules to allow Democrats to use the filibuster-proof budget process to pass the legislation along straight party lines.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that after undergoing the parliamentarian’s review, the bill “remains largely intact.” “The bill, when passed, will meet all of our goals – fighting climate change, lowering health care costs, closing tax loopholes abused by the wealthy and reducing the deficit,” the New York Democrat said.  In a key ruling, the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, allowed a major component of the Democrats’ prescription drug pricing plans to move ahead – giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs for the first time. But MacDonough narrowed another provision aimed at lowering drug prices – imposing penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation. Democrats had wanted the measure to apply both to Medicare and the private insurance market. But the parliamentarian ruled the inflation cap could only apply to Medicare, a Democratic aide said. Meanwhile, MacDonough ruled to keep intact several climate measures from the Environment and Public Works Committee in the reconciliation bill, including a methane fee that would apply to oil and gas producers leaking the potent greenhouse gas methane above a certain threshold. Earlier Saturday, Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden of Oregon announced that the clean energy tax portion of the bill “adheres to Senate rules, and important provisions to ensure our clean energy future is built in America have been approved by the parliamentarian.”  How the bill addresses the climate crisis  For a party that failed to pass major climate legislation over 10 years ago, the reconciliation bill represents a major, long-fought victory for Democrats. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet. Analysis from Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measures would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.  The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what’s needed to combat the climate crisis. “This isn’t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.” Key health care and tax policy in the bill  The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. This controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear. However, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.  The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.

242,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/primary-election-results-arizona-michigan-missouri-2022,"""articleBody"":""Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump last year, has lost to a fervent election denier running with Trump’s support, CNN projected early Wednesday.  Republicans in Michigan and Arizona – two states at the center of Trump’s 2020 election denial campaign – voted on Tuesday in primaries for crucial federal and state contests as the shape of the 2022 midterms comes into focus less than a hundred days from Election Day.  Trump’s picks will win the GOP gubernatorial nod in Michigan as well as the GOP nominations for US Senate, secretary of state and attorney general in Arizona, CNN projects. In Arizona, one significant loss was that of state House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who delivered emotional testimony before the House January 6 committee about his resolve in the face of enormous pressure to overturn the 2020 results. He’ll lose a GOP state Senate primary, CNN projected early Wednesday.  Trump’s loss in those battleground states two years ago seeded right-wing anger and turned Republican primary campaigns up and down the ballot into referendums on his election lies. Allies of the former President sought offices crucial to the balance of power in Washington and in state governments, where the GOP is hoping to gain control of the election apparatus ahead of the 2024 presidential contest. With his loss to former Trump administration official John Gibbs, Meijer becomes the second of the so-called “impeachment 10” to lose reelection after South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice lost to a Trump-backed challenger in June.  Two others – Washington Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – were also facing challengers from their own party on Tuesday, but CNN has not yet projected whether they’ll be advancing to the general election. (Under Washington’s primary system, the top two finishers regardless of party advance to November.) Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, perhaps the most high-profile of the House Republicans to have voted for impeachment because of her role as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, faces a Trump-backed opponent later this month.  One of the impeachment 10 – California Rep. David Valadao – survived earlier this year, advancing to the November election in the Golden State’s top two system, while four of the Republicans who voted for impeachment are not running for reelection. Meijer’s primary in his western Michigan district had become a flashpoint in both parties’ national infighting because Gibbs was the beneficiary of Democratic meddling. The party’s House campaign arm, believing that Gibbs would be a less viable general election candidate, ran more than $300,000 in ads ostensibly attacking his alliance with Trump with the goal of boosting him in the primary. But that strategy angered some on the left who thought it undermined their broader messaging against political extremism in the GOP, while sparking fears the gamble could backfire if Gibbs makes it to Congress.  As CNN’s KFILE first reported in 2018, Gibbs has a history of conspiratorial and inflammatory tweets and defended a notorious anti-Semitic troll banned by Twitter. In Michigan’s gubernatorial primary, Trump-backed Tudor Dixon had the support of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and benefited from the disqualification of five would-be candidates after thousands of forged signatures were found on nominating petitions. A conservative commentator who had coalesced support from prominent Republicans in the state, Dixon beat back criticism that she was an establishment candidate who wasn’t “MAGA” enough. Dixon will be taking on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is seeking a second term. Whitmer is a key piece of the Democratic bulwark against Republican power in Michigan, where the GOP controls both legislative chambers.  Tuesday also provided voters with their first chance to directly respond to the US Supreme Court’s striking down of federal abortion rights earlier this summer – an issue that national Democrats hope will energize their base in the fall. Kansas voters have decided to maintain the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution by voting “no” on a proposed constitutional amendment, CNN projects. The procedure is currently legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas, where people from Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri have traveled for services amid Republican-led efforts to roll back abortion rights. Senate primaries will set crucial fall matchups   In Missouri, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt will win the GOP Senate nomination, CNN projects. His victory is a relief for national party leadership anxious that former Gov. Eric Greitens would win and then lose the general election in November. Greitens had resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct and more recently faced allegations of abuse from his ex-wife, which he has denied.   Schmitt and Greitens shared an 11th-hour endorsement from Trump, who said on Monday he was backing “Eric” and leaving it up to voters to decide which one, although both candidates immediately tried to claim the endorsement for themselves.  Echoing a pledge from Greitens, Schmitt – who was endorsed by Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah – said last week that he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for leader. While Trump hedged his bets, the state’s junior senator, Josh Hawley, suffered a loss after backing Rep. Vicky Hartzler. One of two members of Congress seeking the nomination, she was critical of Trump in the aftermath of January 6, but still voted against certifying the presidential vote and touted her voting record with Trump on the trail.  In Arizona, Blake Masters, an acolyte of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel who was Trump’s pick in that race, won the Republicans’ nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in November, CNN projects.  A proxy war between Trump and Pence The race to succeed term-limited Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey split the party, with Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence endorsing Karrin Taylor Robson and Trump backing former television reporter Kari Lake, whose campaign was fueled by the former President’s election lies. Down the ballot in Arizona, Trump-backed election-denying state Rep. Mark Finchem, who attended the January 6, 2021, rally in Washington, will win the Republican nomination for Arizona Secretary of State, CNN projects. The Democratic primary for Arizona Secretary of State remains too early to call. And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN projects. Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs will win the Democratic nod for governor, CNN projects.  Moderate prevails in member vs. member primary  Besides the GOP drama in Michigan’s 3rd District, Meanwhile, in Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, Rep. Haley Stevens will defeat fellow Democratic Rep. Andy Levin, CNN projects, in a clash of incumbents that was the latest chapter of a proxy fight between moderates and progressives. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) had backed Stevens and its new super PAC, United Democracy Project, spent more than $4 million to boost her bid. UDP’s outlay, along with bundling by AIPAC, spurred another pro-Israel group, the liberal J Street, to jump in on Levin’s behalf, splashing $700,000 in a July ad buy for him.

159,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/trump-justice-department-january-6-criminal-investigation/,"""articleBody"":""Former President Donald Trump’s legal team is in direct communication with Justice Department officials, the first sign of talks between the two sides as the criminal probe into January 6, 2021, accelerates, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. The talks revolve around whether Trump would be able to shield conversations he had while he was president from federal investigators. In recent weeks, investigators have moved aggressively into Trump’s orbit, subpoenaing top former White House officials, focusing on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and executing searches of lawyers who sought to aid those efforts. The Trump team’s discussions are with the US attorney’s office in Washington, DC, which is in charge of the investigation, and its top January 6 prosecutor Thomas Windom, the sources said. The conversations have not been previously reported. At this stage, the conversations are focused mostly on whether any communications that witnesses from the Trump West Wing had with the former President can be kept from a federal criminal grand jury under Trump’s claims of executive privilege, the people said. The Justice Department has been anticipating a court fight with Trump over executive privilege. The issue has arisen as grand jury subpoenas have been issued to two former White House counsel’s office officials and to former Vice President Mike Pence’s chief counsel and chief of staff. Trump’s legal defense team has warned him that indictments are possible, sources tell CNN. Some members of Trump’s legal team have discussed his potential defense strategies on at least two occasions in recent months, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as they brace for new developments in the Justice Department probe and a separate investigation by Georgia officials into his potentially criminal meddling in the state’s 2020 election results. Rolling Stone previously reported that Trump had been briefed. Trump has grilled his attorneys on whether they actually believe he will face formal charges, sources said. Yet the former President has expressed a heavy dose of skepticism that he will be indicted, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.  Another source close to the former President told CNN that Trump also has posed questions about a potential indictment to members of his inner circle, some of whom believe the President is concerned about the possibility of federal charges.  But one person close to Trump said he is noticeably more engaged when he is chatting with friends and advisers about the 2022 midterms and his possible presidential campaign in 2024 than he has been during briefings on legal strategy. This person described the former President as dismissive in conversations about his legal troubles, often repeating his “witch hunt” mantra as he claims the various probes he’s facing are plainly driven by political opponents.  A Trump spokesman said in a statement to CNN: “There is clearly a concerted effort to undermine the vital, Constitutionally-rooted Executive and Attorney-Client Privileges through partisan, political persecution.”  “How can any future President ever have private conversations with his attorneys, counselors, and other senior advisors if any such advisor is forced, either during or after the Presidency, in front of an Unselect Committee or other entity, and be forced to reveal those privileged, confidential discussions?” the spokesman said. “President Trump will not be deterred by witch hunts or kangaroo courts from continuing to defend and fight for America, our Constitution, and the Truth.”  The Justice Department declined to comment. Mark Meadows could be a key witness In recent months, the former President has ignored advice from some of his advisers to avoid speaking with former and current aides who have become entangled in the House select committee’s probe into January 6 and may become part of the criminal investigation, people familiar with the matter told CNN.   Trump has specifically been counseled to cut contact with his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, whose actions leading up to and on the day of the US Capitol insurrection have been deeply scrutinized by the House panel, the people said. Two of Meadows’ former top aides, Cassidy Hutchinson and Alyssa Farah Griffin, also have been highly critical of Trump, with Hutchinson testifying about damaging details about Trump’s actions on January 6 during her public testimony before the House panel in June. Hutchinson is cooperating in the DOJ probe as well.  Some of Trump’s attorneys believe Meadows could also be in investigators’ crosshairs and are concerned he could become a fact witness if he is pushed to cooperate in the Justice Department probe, according to two people familiar with the matter. In response, Meadows’ attorney George Terwilliger told CNN on Thursday: “All of that is idle and uninformed speculation, apparently by people that know little but talk a lot.” Former White House attorney Ty Cobb said Meadows is “perfectly positioned to be the John Dean of this mess,” referring to the former Richard Nixon aide who offered crucial public testimony during the Watergate hearings. “The reason [Meadows] is valuable is also the reason he is in jeopardy: He was basically at Trump’s right hand throughout all these exercises and participated in key meetings and phone calls,” Cobb said.   Yet, according to a source familiar with the relationship, Trump and Meadows have spoken a number of times. Another source close to Trump described their relationship as “not the same as it once was” while they served in the White House, but insisted they still maintained a relationship, even as Trump has complained about Meadows in his recent conversations with other allies. Meadows has been known to attend fundraisers and events at the former President’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he also helped organize a donor retreat last April for the Conservative Partnership Institute, a group he runs with former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint. The securing of Trump’s endorsement for US Senate candidate Ted Budd “was the last time Meadows was really around regularly. Since then, he’s never been a big part of the political operation or [Trump’s] thought process,” said a second person close to Trump.

540,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/opinions/afghanistan-exit-a-year-later-bergen/,"""articleBody"":""Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Bergen’s new paperback is “The Rise and fall of Osama bin Laden.” from which this article is, in part, adapted. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. In 1961, after a CIA-backed invasion of Cuba failed spectacularly, President John F. Kennedy said of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, “Victory has 100 fathers and defeat is an orphan.”  Last week, President Joe Biden took a victory lap when he announced that the US had tracked down and killed its most wanted terrorist, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was living in a house in Kabul, Afghanistan. Don’t expect a similar celebration on August 30, the first anniversary of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which ended the longest war in American history. Any realistic assessment of that action shows that it will long be seen as a defeat rather than a victory – and it’s likely no one will own up to the responsibility for the decision.  The US launched a war against Afghanistan in 2001 after the Taliban regime harbored Osama bin Laden, giving him the ability to plot and carry out the 9/11 terrorist attacks which killed almost 3,000 Americans.  As US and NATO troops battled Taliban and al Qaeda forces, the new US-backed government in Kabul also presided over two decades of progress in Afghanistan. To be sure, Afghanistan wasn’t Norway, but it was becoming a somewhat functional, democratizing Central Asian state that saw striking progress in reducing child mortality and increasing life expectancy, one that provided jobs for women and education for millions of girls; it nurtured scores of independent media outlets, and held regular, if flawed, presidential elections.   All of that changed when the US began withdrawing and the Taliban took over the entire country on August 15, 2021. Women’s rights evaporated. They have no right to work, except in a narrow set of female-related jobs such as cleaning women’s toilets in Kabul;  when they travel distances of more than 45 miles they must be accompanied by a male relative,  and the Taliban have ordered women to stay at home and to cover themselves completely should they ever venture out. Their male relatives will be punished by the Taliban if women don’t follow these directives. Girls do not have the right to be educated after the age of 12.   On the Taliban’s  management of Afghanistan, one data point suffices to underline the  group’s gross incompetence: Around half of the Afghan population are today “facing acute hunger,” according to the UN.  On the Taliban’s respect for other ethnic Afghan groups: There is no evidence that the Taliban are creating an “inclusive” government as their leaders claimed they would. Pashtuns make up almost all the leadership of the Taliban, while other ethnic groups in Afghanistan such as the Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks are almost entirely excluded from leadership roles.   On their respect for democracy: The Taliban, conveniently, don’t believe in elections. Instead, they are a theocracy; their leader is known as the “Commander of the Faithful,” a title that claims he is the leader of all Muslims. In the past year under Taliban rule, 40% of Afghanistan’s independent media outlets have closed.  On the Taliban’s alliance with al Qaeda: Well, last week’s news made clear the relationship is thriving. The fact that the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri was living in downtown Kabul for months – with what the Biden administration describes as the awareness of some Taliban officials – speaks for itself. Zawahiri was killed late last month in a US drone strike.   After the news broke that Zawahiri had been hiding in Kabul, Lisa Curtis, the top official at the White House for Afghanistan during the Trump administration, tweeted “#Taliban basically asserting Doha agreement allows them to shelter #AlQaeda. Proves it was the worst agreement in US history. Not worth the paper on which it’s written.” This was a particularly damning assessment coming from a senior American official who was working on Afghanistan while the Doha agreement between the US and the Taliban was being negotiated.  One of the most powerful men in Afghanistan today is the acting Minister of Interior, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who has ties to al Qaeda, according to a United Nations report that said he is “assessed to be a member of the wider Al-Qaida leadership, but not of the Al-Qaida core leadership.”  A February 2020 opinion piece in The New York Times with Haqqani’s byline blandly identified him only as “the deputy leader of the Taliban.” What the Times didn’t tell its readers is that Haqqani was also on the FBI’s most wanted list and that his men had kidnapped a reporter for … The New York Times.   This op-ed featured ludicrous lies including, “We together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam – from the right to education to the right to work – are protected” and “reports about foreign [terrorist] groups in Afghanistan are politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war.”  How it happened The US pullout from Afghanistan a year ago was orchestrated by a successive series of decisions by former President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden and the chief US negotiator with the Taliban, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad. None of these men are ever likely to fully acknowledge their paternity of the debacle that unfolded in Afghanistan, which followed the worst diplomatic agreement in US history that enabled the Taliban to win at the negotiating table in Doha, Qatar what they could never win on the battlefield. Khalilzad has defended the deal saying, “The negotiation was a result of–based on the judgment that we weren’t winning the war and therefore time was not on our side and better to make a deal sooner than later.”  By the end of the Trump administration, the fledgling Afghan state was supported by only some 2,500 US troops, a tiny fraction of the more than two million men and women in the active-duty US military, reserves, and National Guard units. Assisted by 9,000 allied, mostly NATO troops and 18,000 contractors this small US force was enough to enable the Afghan military to fend off the Taliban, which was never able to capture and hold any of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals before Biden announced the total American withdrawal in April 2021.    Why Biden went through with the withdrawal plan that he had inherited from Trump is still something of a puzzle since there was no large, vocal constituency in the Democratic Party that was demanding a total US pullout from Afghanistan, and Biden’s top military advisers had clearly warned him of the risks of doing so. In public testimony before the US Senate Armed Services Committee,  US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and US CENTCOM commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, said they had advised the Biden administration that unless the US kept around 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, the Afghan military would collapse. Collapse it did.    The “Taliban 2.0” delusion The publication of Haqqani’s op-ed in The New York Times was emblematic of the wishful thinking about the Taliban in the   US that had persisted for years. In this view the Taliban were just a bunch of misunderstood backwoodsmen who would eventually do what was only sensible: break with al Qaeda and abandon much of their misogynistic ideology as a quid pro quo for their recognition on the world stage.  This was a classic case of mirror imaging; the belief that the Taliban would do the rational things some gullible Americans expected them to do, as opposed to implementing the quasi-mediaeval ideology that has been at the core of their armed movement since they first emerged almost three decades ago. It was like imagining the Khmer Rouge would “mature” once they had taken power in Cambodia.  A key proponent of the view that the Taliban would change if the right carrots were dangled in front of them was Barnett Rubin of NYU, an expert on Afghanistan, who claimed in a paper that he published with the United States Institute of Peace in March 2021 that the  US had “underestimated the leverage that the Taliban’s quest for sanctions relief, recognition and international assistance provides.”    Turns out that it was Rubin who overestimated how much the Taliban cared about sanctions relief and international assistance, while he had also vastly underestimated their desire to banish women from jobs and education and maintain their warm relations with their old buddies in al Qaeda. This shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, since that was exactly how the Taliban had ruled the last time that they were in power in the years before 9/11. The Taliban hadn’t fought the US and Afghan militaries for two decades only to install a quasi-democracy when they came to power for the second time. The “moderate” Taliban 2.0 that was supposedly emerging in recent years was a profound delusion that gripped US policymakers.   A month after Biden had announced the impending withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan, the US negotiator with the Taliban, Khalilzad, testified to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 16, 2021, that those who thought the Taliban would quickly take over the country as the US pulled out were “mistaken.” Khalilzad also asserted that the Taliban would opt for a political settlement over a military victory, testifying, “They say they seek normalcy in terms of relations — acceptability, removal from sanctions, not to remain a pariah.”   Just months later the distinctive white flags of the Taliban were fluttering over the capital, Kabul, and the Taliban began implementing their theocratic state. In a symbolic move the Taliban’s feared religious police soon commandeered what had formerly been the ministry for women’s affairs. Obviously, that ministry would no longer be needed, but the “Vice and Virtue” police would have to be properly accommodated.   The United Nations released a report in May in which it observed that an astonishing 41 members of the Taliban serving in the cabinet or other senior-level government positions in Afghanistan are on UN sanctions lists.    Taliban 2.0 was a mirage, and the Taliban today is Taliban 1.0 with one major difference; they are far better armed than the Taliban that ruled over most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Now they ride into battle with American armored vehicles and M-16 rifles that were left behind as the US military rushed for the exits last summer.  The Taliban today also face a far weaker opposition movement in Afghanistan than was the case for the pre-9/11 Taliban.    Signaling weakness to Russia and China  When Biden spoke to the American people on  Aug. 31, 2021, as the last US soldiers departed Afghanistan, he framed the withdrawal as a way of positioning the US to compete better against great-power rivals, saying, “We’re engaged in a serious competition with China. We’re dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia…And there’s nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan.” This was an absurd rationale: For years both China and Russia had hoped to push American forces out of Afghanistan because the country borders both China and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Russia had covertly supported the Taliban, according to the US military, while the Chinese had drawn closer to the Taliban in recent years.   As they pulled out of Afghanistan, the Americans abandoned the vast Bagram Air Base which could house up to 10,000 troops; a more ideal site from which to engage in competition with either China or Russia is hard to imagine.   You could practically hear the high fives in the Kremlin as the US ignominiously retreated from Afghanistan, which seemed to herald an era of the US pulling back from the world. It hardly seems accidental that three months later Russian President Vladimir Putin moved an army to the border with Ukraine as a prelude to his invasion of the country.    A predictable fiasco In June 2021, I wrote for CNN, “We could see in Afghanistan a remix of the disastrous US pullout from Saigon in 1975 and the summer of 2014 in Iraq when ISIS took over much of the country following the US pullout from the country.”   That prediction, unfortunately, proved to be accurate; the American pullout from Saigon looked like a dignified retreat compared to the scenes of thousands of desperate Afghans trying to get on planes leaving Kabul airport last August. Some Afghans were so desperate to leave that they clung to the fuselage of a plane that was taking off – and two plunged to their deaths. On  Aug. 25, 2021, 13 US soldiers and at least 170 Afghans were killed at the airport by a suicide bomber dispatched by the Afghan branch of ISIS. And the Taliban took over the entire country even before the last US soldiers had left Afghanistan. Compounding Biden’s disastrous policy decision to completely pull out of Afghanistan was the botched handling of the withdrawal. According to a report about that withdrawal released in February by Republican senators sitting on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the first White House meeting to discuss evacuating Americans and Afghans from Afghanistan took place on Aug. 14, only one day before the Taliban seized Kabul and five months after Biden had first publicly announced the total US withdrawal from the country.    Biden patted himself on the back that the US military subsequently extracted 124,000 Afghans from Afghanistan, calling the operation an “extraordinary success,” which was like an arsonist praising himself for helping to try to put out a fire that he had started.  But even accepting the most self-congratulatory view of the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal, the vast majority of the Afghans who had worked with the US were abandoned. The Association of Wartime Allies, an advocacy group for Afghans who had worked for the US, estimated in March that only about 3% of the 81,000 Afghans who had worked for the US government and had applied for special visas had made it out of Afghanistan, leaving 78,000 behind.  Four months after the Taliban took over Afghanistan, the Biden administration convened the “Summit for Democracy” in Washington consisting of the world’s democracies. Five months earlier Afghanistan would have warranted an invitation to this summit, but Biden had enabled the Taliban to take over the country, which ended almost every shred of a liberal democracy that had once existed there. Following the Afghan debacle, Biden’s favorable ratings dropped to the lowest level of his presidency to that point to 46%. They have never recovered.  The Biden administration now faces a policy dilemma of its own making. Since so many millions of Afghans are on the brink of starvation, Biden officials cannot completely turn their backs on Afghanistan. And yet, it’s hard to help Afghans without propping up the Taliban in some manner. The Biden administration has tried to ensure that all US aid to Afghanistan is administered in a way that it doesn’t end up in the hands of the Taliban, but realistically any help that the US sends to Afghanistan tends to help the Taliban remain in power.  This is surely one of the most spectacular own goals the US has ever scored."",",Peter Bergen;Peter Bergen;Ayman Al-Zawahiri;Joe Biden,Arizona State University;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EDUCATION,93;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,93;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,45;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,37;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,37;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,37;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,37;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,662;TERROR,651;ARMEDCONFLICT,651;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,64;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,669;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,133;KILL,625;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,625;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,37;LEADER,64;LEADER,400;LEADER,540;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,64;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,400;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,540;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,64;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,400;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,540;WB_756_VULNERABLE_GROUPS,501;WB_421_SOCIAL_INCLUSION,501;WB_758_ORPHANS,501;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,501;TAX_FNCACT_FATHERS,479;",Cuba;Bay Of Pigs;Arizona;America;Afghanistan;Kabul
170,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/pelosi-demilitarized-zone-south-korea/,"""articleBody"":""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that a congressional delegation traveled to South Korea and visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone that divides North and South Korea. “It was a privilege to engage with American heroes in uniform on the ground in Korea, led by General Paul LaCamera, Commander, U.S. Forces Korea. During visits to the Demilitarized Zone/Joint Security Area (DMZ/JSA) and Osan Air Base, we conveyed the gratitude of the Congress and the Country for the patriotic service of our Servicemembers, who stand as sentinels of Democracy on the Korean peninsula,” Pelosi said in the statement. The DMZ is a 160-mile-long no-man’s land about 30 miles north of Seoul that was established in the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement. It is often described as the world’s most heavily armed border.  Pelosi said the delegation also visited Seoul and praised what she described as “a strong bond” between the US and South Korea.  “The United States and South Korea share a strong bond formed for security and forged by decades of warm friendship. Our Congressional delegation traveled to Seoul to reaffirm our treasured ties and our shared commitment to advancing security and stability, economic growth and democratic governance,” Pelosi said.  Pelosi said the delegation was “honored to be hosted” at a parliamentary meeting “where we reaffirmed our commitment to the U.S.-Korea alliance” and “was pleased to engage in a phone meeting with Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol.”  Providing a readout of the call, Pelosi said, “we thanked the President for Korea’s hospitality of 28,000 U.S. Servicemembers and their families. Each Member engaged in conversation with the President, highlighting areas of continued cooperation to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.”  The announcement comes after Pelosi recently visited Taiwan amid threats of Chinese retaliation. Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan. Pelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

581,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/investing/stocks-week-ahead/,"""articleBody"":""A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. After the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, investors quickly reached a consensus: The central bank was turning slightly dovish. After embarking on an aggressive rate-hike spree this year in a bid to fight inflation, the Fed indicated it could downgrade the size of its hikes moving forward. “We’ve been front-end loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters. Of course, Powell said, another “unusually large” increase could be on the table too. But Wall Street looked past that. What came next: Investors cheered Powell’s apparent pivot. The S&P 500 rallied, notching its best month since November 2020, and financial conditions eased. Mortgage rates fell below 5% for the first time since mid-April. Now, Fed officials are trying to set the record straight. Not wanting markets to change course too sharply, reversing the effects of their hard work thus far, they’ve been talking tough again. “[We’re] nowhere near almost done,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview on LinkedIn last week. Loretta Mester, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the Washington Post that it “would be inappropriate … to cry victory too early” and risk letting high inflation become entrenched.  “We need to see really compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, and my view is that we haven’t seen that yet,” Mester said. As the Fed tries to bring demand back down so it stops running up against limited supply — pushing up prices — it’s closely watching the labor market, which has remained strong. While job openings fell in June, the US economy continues to add jobs at a healthy pace. A blowout July report released Friday showed a gain of 528,000 positions last month. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%. The news poured cold water on the theory that the Fed would change its approach dramatically any time soon. The central bank actually wants to see some weakening in the job market. When there are too many open roles, wages rise quickly, which can make economy-wide inflation even worse. “This isn’t the news the Fed wanted to hear, and this will likely cause it to push rates higher, faster,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Investors have come back around: The stock market on Friday predicted a 66% chance of a three-quarter-point rate hike in September, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. On Thursday, the market had priced in just a 34% chance of a hike that high.  Coming up: The next big data release is the Consumer Price Index, which is used to track US inflation. Economists polled by Refinitiv expect to learn that prices rose 8.7% in the year to July, down slightly from June. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation may have inched higher. America’s strong dollar is hurting everyone else The US dollar has been on a tear this year. That’s good news for American tourists gallivanting around Europe, but bad news for pretty much every other country in the world.  The latest: The greenback is up more than 10% in 2022 compared to other top currencies — near its highest level in two decades — as investors worried about a global recession have rushed to scoop up dollars, which are considered a safe haven in turbulent times. Adding to the dollar’s appeal is the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to tackle decades-high inflation. That’s made American investments more attractive, since they now offer higher returns. US travelers may be rejoicing that a night out in Rome that once cost $100 now costs about $80, but it’s a more complicated picture for multinational companies and foreign governments. See here: About half of international trade is invoiced in dollars, running up bills for manufacturers and small businesses that rely on imported goods. Governments that need to repay their debts in dollars could also run into trouble, especially if reserves run low. The dollar’s gain is already hurting some vulnerable economies. A shortage of dollars in Sri Lanka contributed to the worst economic crisis in the country’s history, ultimately forcing the country’s president out of office last month. Pakistan’s rupee plunged to a record low against the dollar in late July, pushing it to the brink of default. And Egypt — battered by rising food prices — is dealing with a depleted store of dollars and an exodus of foreign investment. All three countries have had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help.  “It’s been a challenging environment,” William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, told me.

650,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-taiwan-military-exercises-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/,"""articleBody"":""China’s military exercises around Taiwan this week aim to send a pointed message to governments in Taipei, Tokyo and Washington that Beijing alone calls the shots in the Taiwan Strait, analysts say. Experts also suggest the announcement of the drills shortly after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday was no snap reaction to her controversial visit – rather, the exercises are part of a relentless, years-long plan to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. Pelosi’s trip to the island – a democracy of 24 million that the Chinese Communist Party regards as its territory despite having never controlled it – has merely thrust the issue of Taiwan into news headlines, analysts said. “That’s what Nancy Pelosi really accomplished, raising global awareness of China’s sustained military coercion campaign against Taiwan that’s been going on for more than a decade,” said Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. “They do this every year,” Thompson said of the Chinese exercises. “The difference this year is that we’re paying attention.”  Reaction in Taipei, Tokyo and Washington The government in Taipei is certainly on alert, announcing Friday that multiple Chinese warships and jets had crossed the median line – the midway point between the mainland and Taiwan that Beijing says it does not recognize but usually respects. After China sent ballistic missiles over the island Thursday, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen vowed to “firmly defend our sovereignty and national security, and stick to the line of defense of democracy and freedom.” Those missiles got the attention of Japan, too. Five of them landed inside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone, an area of the ocean where a country enjoys special rights to resources like fishing and mining under the seabed. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the Chinese drills were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people.” He called for an immediate halt to them and said Japan would work with its closest ally, the United States, “to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait.” Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the ASEAN-US Ministerial meeting in Cambodia, said, “I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” But in Washington, the official line was that Beijing’s actions came as no surprise. “We anticipated that China might take steps like this – in fact, I described them for you in quite some detail just the other day,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We also expect that these actions will continue and that the Chinese will continue to react in the coming days.”  Isolating Taiwan Visiting with Kishida on Friday, Pelosi said Beijing was trying to “isolate” Taiwan. China’s exercises were designed to practice doing exactly that, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii. “China (is showing) it can bombard Taiwan with missiles and isolate it from outside support and affect air and maritime trade through the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan,” Schuster said. That’s long been Beijing’s plan, and this week’s exercises are just the manifestation of at least months of planning and years of policy, the experts said. “An exercise of this size, scope and complexity cannot be planned and the forces prepared in two weeks,” Schuster said, referring to the period following rumors of Pelosi’s trip to the island. He said the outlines of the Chinese military exercises were likely decided a year ago and most of the actions set by April.  Parts of the drills, like the multiple ballistic missile launches, could have been added in the past few weeks as the logistics of those are not as complicated as say, setting up a naval blockade, which Beijing said was one of its practice points for the exercises.  Drills ‘to intimidate the US and Japan’ Schuster also noted that the exercises are larger than those China has organized in previous years. “This expanded exercise activity has a third purpose – to intimidate the US and Japan – both of which have indicated their support for Taiwan,” Schuster said. “If you look at the rhetoric from January to April, (Chinese President Xi Jinping) and company were ramping up criticism of the US and Japan, the latter over recent statements of support for Taiwan and its increased defense spending.” Japan’s 2022 Defense White Paper, an annual look at its security policy published in late July, called out Beijing in no uncertain terms. “China continues to unilaterally change or attempt to change the status quo by coercion in the East China Sea and South China Sea,” it says. “Furthermore, China has made clear that it would not hesitate to unify Taiwan by force, further increasing tensions in the region.” In a virtual speech to a Taiwanese think tank last December, the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said an armed invasion of Taiwan would be a grave danger to Japan. “People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should never have a misunderstanding in recognizing this,” Abe said.  Perhaps Beijing wasn’t listening or just doesn’t care. The exercises – particularly the launching of missiles that landed in Japan’s EEZ – show that, experts said. “They have validated Shinzo Abe’s concerns that at a Taiwan emergency is a Japan emergency and an emergency for the US-Japan alliance,” Thompson, of the National University of Singapore, said. And that emergency can be expected to continue. Bringing Taiwan into Beijing’s control is a bedrock of Chinese policy. On Friday, China continued its exercises and military intimidation unabated. Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang acknowledged the exercises were having the effect Beijing desires, showing how it can control the Taiwan Strait. “The evil neighbor next door flexed its muscles on our doorstep and arbitrarily sabotaged (one of) the busiest waterways in the world with military exercises,” he said."",",Fumio Kishida;Shinzo Abe;Shinzo Abe;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Hector Retamal;Hector Retamal;Antony Blinken;John Kirby;Carl Schuster,Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public;National University Of Singapore;National University Of Singapore;Us Pacific Command Joint Intelligence Center;Us National Security Council;Chinese Communist Party;United States;United States;United States;United States,"EDUCATION,1028;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1028;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,2148;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,5844;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,5449;MARITIME,3660;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1847;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2231;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2968;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,5375;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,5777;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,6768;SLFID_MILITARY_SPENDING,5312;EPU_CATS_FISCAL_POLICY,5312;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,2454;ARMEDCONFLICT,3581;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1847;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2968;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1847;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2968;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1847;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2968;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1847;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,2968;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,636;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2008;WB_862_GROWTH_POLES_AND_ECONOMIC_ZONES,2008;WB_346_COMPETITIVE_INDUSTRIES,2008;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2604;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,327;LEADER,1776;LEADER,5159;LEADER,5961;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1776;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,5159;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,5961;ALLIANCE,6493;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,636;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2713;TAX_ETHNICITY_JAPANESE,2133;TAX_ETHNICITY_JAPANESE,5829;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_JAPANESE,2133;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_JAPANESE,5829;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,237;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,773;BLOCKADE,4397;SEIGE,4397;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1449;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1449;MEDIA_MSM,2993;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3470;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,2939;AFFECT,3645;INFO_RUMOR,4042;EPU_ECONOMY,2003;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2003;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,630;WB_137_WATER,3176;ENV_MINING,2104;USPEC_POLICY1,1045;USPEC_POLICY1,3870;USPEC_POLICY1,5382;USPEC_POLICY1,6677;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1045;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3870;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,5382;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,6677;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,2148;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,5844;SOVEREIGNTY,1827;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,5312;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1072;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,6533;WB_698_TRADE,3666;DEMOCRACY,591;DEMOCRACY,1893;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,591;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,1893;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,296;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,2186;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4218;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4786;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2031;MARITIME_PIRACY,3180;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,3012;ENV_WATERWAYS,7035;WB_1805_WATERWAYS,7035;WB_135_TRANSPORT,7035;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,7035;TAX_WEAPONS_WARSHIPS,1540;WB_818_INDUSTRY_POLICY_AND_REAL_SECTORS,2595;WB_1281_MANUFACTURING,2595;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,620;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1143;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1531;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2179;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,3092;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,4110;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,4485;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,4620;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5149;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6069;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6670;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,620;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1143;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1531;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2179;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,3092;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,4110;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,4485;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,4620;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5149;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6069;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6670;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2445;",Chinese;Tingshu;Japan;Taiwan;South China Sea;Beijing;Taipei;Taiwanese;China;Taiwan Strait;Japanese;Pingtan;Fujian;Cambodia;Hawaii;East China Sea;Tokyo;United States;Washington
95,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/weather/kentucky-appalachia-flooding-sunday/,"""articleBody"":""At least 28 people have died in last week’s flooding in Kentucky as rescuers continue to search for missing people and the region braces for yet more rain. “Our confirmed count of Kentuckians we’ve lost has now reached 28, and we expect that there will be more, and that that number will grow,” Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday. The devastating flooding Thursday was unprecedented, officials said, inundating houses and sweeping some from their foundations. “This is one of the most devastating deadly floods that we have seen in our history,” Beshear said on NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday. “It wiped out areas where people didn’t have that much to begin with.” “We’re going to be finding bodies for weeks, many of them swept hundreds of yards, maybe a quarter-mile plus from where they were last,” the governor said.   Now, more rainfall is in the forecast that threatens some areas hardest-hit by the deadly flooding. “The forecast is concerning, and we’re watching it very closely, obviously. We also are sending out warnings and making sure everyone knows,” said Col. Jeremy Slinker, the Kentucky emergency management director. “We’re preparing for it and making sure all the residents there are prepared for it because we just don’t want to lose anyone else or have any more tragedy,” he told CNN’s Pamela Brown Saturday.  A flood watch is in effect through at least Monday morning for parts of southern and eastern Kentucky, according to the National Weather Service, and there is a Level 3 of 4 moderate risk for excessive rainfall Sunday across southeastern Kentucky, per the Weather Prediction Center, escalating the concern of additional flooding.  “The threat of flash flooding will be gradually increasing as showers and thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall rates develop and expand in coverage today,” the center said, deeming the atmospheric conditions in the area as “tropical in nature,” meaning it is warm, moist and can support an incredible amount of water. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are forecast over the next 24 to 48 hours, but as much as 4 or 5 inches is possible in localized areas. As little as 1 to 2 inches can revive flooding concerns, particularly in areas already inundated with heavy rain where the soil is saturated.  Some areas remain unreachable, governor says Officials believe thousands have been affected, and efforts to rebuild some areas may take years, the governor told CNN Saturday. The state’s estimated losses are potentially in the “tens if not the hundreds of millions of dollars.” In Perry County alone, approximately 50 bridges were washed away, County Judge Executive Scott Alexander said at a news conference Sunday morning, calling it “the biggest event that I’m aware of that Perry County has ever faced.”   State officials Sunday were working to open Buckhorn State Park to house a number of those who lost their homes, the governor said at the news conference, adding he hoped to announce the state park could be used as a shelter soon. “We recognize that the hotels and motels here are full, the shelters are full, that people are sleeping in their cars and trucks and we don’t need that,” Beshear said.  After the rain, excessive heat is expected to build over the region Tuesday as many people are currently struggling with no access to clean drinking water, power outages and cell service still out in some counties Sunday. “We have multiple Kentucky State Police posts that are taking calls from loved ones that can’t connect with those that they are worried about,” the governor told NBC Sunday. “But it’s going to take some time to get a firm grasp on that. We still can’t get into some areas to check on people.”  More than 13,000 homes and businesses in the region were in the dark early Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us; three drinking water systems were totally out of operation Saturday, the governor said, leaving residents without access to water, or only access to water which needed to be boiled before it could be safely consumed. The federal government sent tractor trailers of bottled water to the region, and more financial assistance is on the way. The flooding – as with other recent weather disasters – was further amplified by the climate crisis: As global temperatures climb as a result of human-caused fossil fuel emissions, the atmosphere is able to hold more water, making water vapor more abundantly available to fall as rain. Scientists are increasingly confident in the role the climate crisis plays in extreme weather, and have warned such events will become more intense and more dangerous with every fraction of a degree of warming.  Officials have moved swiftly to approve financial assistance, given the scores of people in need of relief after losing everything. The federal government greenlighted funding for people in five counties “at a pace that we’ve never seen before,” Kentucky Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman told CNN’s Pamela Brown Saturday. “Residents will actually receive direct payments, which is some really good news in what will be a very long tunnel to see the light,” Coleman said. Coleman did not provide an exact date on when those payments are expected to reach residents, though she said they will be dispersed as soon as the state receives the money. Nearly $700,000 has been raised for relief efforts, Beshear said Saturday, noting funeral expenses for those killed in the flooding will be paid for. Additionally, the state is prioritizing placing generators at the shelters for flood survivors as temperatures are expected to soar Tuesday following the rain.  ‘Hero’ rescued family from flooded home Among the tales of heroism emerging from the disaster is an unidentified man who drifted through fast-moving water to get a 98-year-old grandmother, her grandson and another family member out of their home as it was nearly swallowed by the flooding Thursday. Randy Polly, who witnessed the rescue in Whitesburg, Kentucky, and recorded parts of it on his cellphone, told CNN he got stuck a distance away from the home on his way to get gas Thursday morning. Polly said he heard people yelling across the flooded road, “Get me help, get help.” He called 911, but first responders were overwhelmed and unresponsive to his calls.  Around 9 a.m., he saw a man he described as a hero drift over to the house and start banging on the door and window. The man eventually helped get three people out of the home and guided them through rushing water, the videos show. The rescue took about 30 minutes, Polly said. Missy Crovetti, who lives in Green Oaks, Illinois, told CNN the people rescued in the video are her grandmother Mae Amburgey, uncle Larry Amburgey and brother Gregory Amburgey. They are safe and doing well, she said. Crovetti said she does not know the name of the man who rescued her family. Polly also said he does not know the man’s name. CNN’s Chris Boyett, Sharif Paget, Gene Norman, Derek Van Dam, Haley Brink, Jalen Beckford, Angela Fritz, Chuck Johnston and Raja Razek contributed to this report.

563,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/mike-pompeo-january-6-committee/,"""articleBody"":""Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the House January 6 committee on Tuesday, according to panel member Rep. Zoe Lofgren. The California Democrat confirmed CNN’s earlier reporting that Pompeo would be deposed by the committee, according to a source familiar with the matter.  CNN has previously reported on Pompeo’s negotiations with the committee about his testimony. The panel has shown an increased interest in members of former President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, particularly regarding conversations among Cabinet members about invoking the 25th Amendment after January 6, 2021, and the committee’s focus in the Pompeo interview was expected to be on the 25th Amendment, the source said. A portion of the 25th Amendment, which addresses presidential succession, allows a vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to vote to remove a president from office due to his inability to “discharge the powers and duties of his office.”  Pompeo served as CIA director for the first year of Trump’s presidency, and led the State Department for Trump’s final three years, where he was a stalwart Trump ally and defender. Lofgren refused to comment on the particulars of Pompeo’s testimony in an interview on Tuesday, but told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” that “he came in willingly, and he did answer questions for quite some time.” When asked if the committee learned any new information from Pompeo’s testimony, Lofgren said, “I think we fill in a few pieces here and there each time we interview someone. Obviously, we’ve had testimony from others about what he said and did. And so, it’s just a matter of filling out the entire picture, especially on that day and the events subsequent to that day, where the Cabinet secretaries had concerns about the President.”  The New York Times was first to report Pompeo’s expected appearance Tuesday. As discussions surrounding the 25th Amendment come into focus, the committee had also hoped to hear from Doug Mastriano, the Trump-endorsed Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.  However, Mastriano’s virtual appearance Tuesday only lasted about 15 minutes and “he didn’t answer a single question,” according to a source familiar with the matter. Mastriano’s attorney cut off the virtual appearance soon after it began, the source said. His lawyer, Tim Parlatore, took issue with several procedural matters related to the deposition, and raised questions about the legality of the subpoena that Mastriano received from the panel, the source added. Mastriano, a key figure in Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, led a faux legislative “hearing” at a hotel in Gettysburg a few weeks after the 2020 election, where Trump and his then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani made false claims about election fraud. He also chartered buses to bring Trump supporters to Washington on January 6, and he was briefly in charge of the Pennsylvania state Senate’s partisan “audit” of the 2020 election. Last week, Mastriano threatened to walk out of a scheduled deposition before the House select committee unless the panel agreed to his conditions, potentially setting up a court fight over his testimony. In a letter to the committee, his attorney, Parlatore had said he would pull out of the scheduled deposition unless they could agree to certain accommodations. Parlatore asked that he be able to videotape the deposition, keep the footage in escrow, and release portions of it later on, if the committee publicly releases clips that he believes would require additional context. Several Trump Cabinet officials have already met with the committee, including Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. Attorney General William Barr also met with the committee, but he had left the administration prior to the January 6 insurrection. This story has been updated with additional background information. CNN’s Marshall Cohen, Zachary Cohen, Chandelis Duster, Sara Murray and Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report."",",Tim Parlatore;Eugene Scalia;Chris Miller;Doug Mastriano;Jeffrey Rosen;Rudy Giuliani;Mike Pompeo;William Barr,New York Times;Department For Trump;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"STRIKE,1831;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,853;ELECTION_FRAUD,1621;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,844;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,683;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1285;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,1272;NEGOTIATIONS,246;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,246;WB_840_JUSTICE,246;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,246;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,246;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,246;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,246;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,246;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,246;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,246;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,1672;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,30;TRIAL,2035;TRIAL,2512;TRIAL,2576;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2035;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2512;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2576;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,84;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,265;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,496;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1004;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1190;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1891;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2020;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2299;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2444;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2625;CORRUPTION,1621;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,1621;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1621;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1621;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,1621;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1264;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,1646;LEADER,359;LEADER,683;LEADER,741;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,359;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,683;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,741;TREASON,2687;ELECTION,1431;ELECTION,1537;ELECTION,1615;ELECTION,1783;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2408;ACT_MAKESTATEMENT,1024;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,21;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2481;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2552;",Pennsylvania;Gettysburg;New York
240,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/entertainment/monica-lewinsky-beyonce-lyric/,"""articleBody"":""Since Beyoncé is editing lyrics, Monica Lewinsky has a request. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who became embroiled in a sex scandal with then President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, tweeted the news of Beyoncé removing an abelist slur from the song “Heated” on her new album “Renaissance” with a suggestion. “uhmm, while we’re at it… #Partition,”Lewinsky tweeted. “Partition” is a track from the singer’s 2013 self-titled fifth studio album. In the song, Beyoncé sings that a man “Monica Lewinsky’d all on my gown.” The affair between Clinton and then-22-year-old Lewinsky ultimately led to Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 and much discussion about consent and abuse of power. In 2021, Lewinsky told CNN’s Jake Tapper that “what’s really important to remember in today’s world is that we never should have even gotten to a place where consent was a question.”  “So it was wholly inappropriate as the most powerful man, my boss, 49 years old,” she said. “I was 22, literally just out of college. And I think that the power differentials there are something that I couldn’t ever fathom consequences at 22 that I understand obviously so differently at 48.” This week, Beyoncé agreed to scrub from her track “Heated” a reference which is considered demeaning to people with spastic cerebral palsy after there was a public outcry.

Around 11.35 p.m. Friday, plainclothes police from the violent crime squad were keeping watch on the party,   being held in a residential area, from an unmarked car, NYPD Chief of Patrol Jeff Maddrey said during an overnight press conference.  Police “believed that there was a potential to be violence involving some of the local street crews,” Maddrey said.  The detectives saw a group of who men arrived at the house, pulled out at least three firearms and started firing at the party. Maddrey said detectives exchanged gunfire with the group of men. Four were shot and taken to the hospital, where they were in stable condition as of Saturday morning, police told CNN.   Police said at least three firearms were recovered. None of the police officers were shot.  “There were a lot of people out here when this occurred,” Maddrey said. “They were basically firing into a crowd.”  “These details are going to illustrate how gun violence continues to beleaguer our communities, and again, I implore members of our community that it is so important to work together with your police so we can put an end to this gun violence,” Maddrey said. Police have not yet named any of the injured men or detailed what charges they may be facing.  Police said no one else was injured in the shooting.

604,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/asia/china-taiwan-pelosi-japan-tensions-intl-hnk/,"""articleBody"":""China pressed ahead with military drills near Taiwan and flew drones close to Japan on Friday, escalating tensions in the strait that have threatened to boil over since Taipei welcomed US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a historic visit. Taiwan’s defense ministry said Chinese warships and aircraft continued drills in waters around the island, adding that Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) forces crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China – in a move it called a “highly provocative act.”  The line has previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings and put air patrol forces, naval ships and shore-based missile systems on alert, the ministry added. Two Chinese drones also flew around Okinawa prefecture in Japan on Thursday, prompting the country’s Air Self-Defense Force to scramble fighter jets in response, according to a statement from Tokyo’s Ministry of Defense on Friday. In all, 49 planes entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ), Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. The ministry had previously suggested 68 aircraft flew into the area, but later clarified that 19 operated west of the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait. The moves comes as China doubles down on rhetoric blaming the US for spiking tensions and forcing it into a response. Beijing announced sanctions against Pelosi and her immediate family and said it would suspend cooperation with Washington on several issues, including fighting climate change, on Friday.  Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang said the island represented “freedom and democracy,” and that “the evil neighbor next door flexed its muscles on our doorstep and arbitrarily sabotaged (one of) the busiest waterways in the world with military exercises.” The skies and waters around Taiwan have become a focal point as Beijing ramps up tensions not only with Taiwan, but with neighboring Japan, which lodged a formal protest with China after five projectiles landed in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The missiles were among a number launched by Beijing Thursday – some of which flew over Taiwan – as Pelosi made her way to Tokyo where she met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday. China has previously fired missiles into waters surrounding Taiwan – a democratic island of 24 million that the Chinese Communist Party regards as its territory, despite having never controlled it – most notably during the Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 1990s. But missiles flying over the island marked a significant escalation, with US officials warning there may be more to come. “We anticipated that China might take steps like this – in fact, I described them for you in quite some detail just the other day,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We also expect that these actions will continue and that the Chinese will continue to react in the coming days.”  A US aircraft carrier will stay in the area around Taiwan for several more days to “monitor the situation,” Kirby added.  On Friday, Kishida said the Chinese military drills were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people” and called for an immediate halt to the exercises. Japan and the US would “work together to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he added. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday, Pelosi accused China of trying “to isolate Taiwan,” pointing to the island’s exclusion from international groups like the World Health Organization.  “They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” she said.  She added that her visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo, not changing it. Later on Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it was imposing sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family for “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs (and) seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Missiles posed ‘no risk’ China started military drills around the island on Thursday, firing multiple missiles toward waters near northeastern and southwestern Taiwan the day after Pelosi’s departure. A Chinese military expert confirmed on state broadcaster CCTV that the conventional missiles flew over Taiwan’s main island, including airspace covered by Taiwanese defense missiles. “We hit the targets under the observation of US Aegis combat system, which means the Chinese military has solved the difficulties of hitting long-range targets on waters,” said Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor of strategy at the National Defense University in Beijing. In a statement late Thursday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said the missiles had traveled above the atmosphere and therefore posed no risk to the island. Authorities did not trigger air raid alerts because they predicted the missiles would land in waters east of Taiwan, the ministry said. The ministry added it would not release further information about the missiles’ trajectory to protect its intelligence-gathering capabilities. Five ballistic missiles are believed to have landed within Japan’s EEZ, including four believed to have flown over Taiwan, said Japan’s Defense Ministry on Thursday.  “This is a serious problem that concerns Japan’s security and the safety of its citizens. We strongly condemn it,” Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters during a news conference. China also sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Thursday – all of which crossed the median line. It follows similar Chinese incursions a day earlier across the median line.  Thursday’s incursions were made by 12 Su-30 fighter jets, eight J-11 fighter jets, and two J-16 fighter jets, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Later Thursday, the ministry said it detected four drones flying over “restricted waters” around the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands near mainland China. The ministry said Taiwan’s military fired flares to warn the drones away, but did not specify the type or origin of the devices. On Friday, a spokesperson from Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said the government’s English website and the ministry website had both detected a large number of attacks on Tuesday – the day Pelosi landed in Taiwan. The IP addresses behind the attacks came from China and Russia, among other locations, with the intention of paralyzing the government sites, said the spokesperson.  She added that the websites were back to normal after emergency repair work, but “massive attacks with malicious intent .. by overseas hostile forces” continued on Thursday and Friday.  Disruptions to trade In a speech on Thursday, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen condemned China’s military drills as “irresponsible,” saying they marked a “deliberate and continuous escalation of military threats.” “I must emphasize that, we do not seek to escalate conflicts or provoke disputes, but we will firmly defend our sovereignty and national safety, as well as safeguarding democracy and freedom,” she added. She also thanked the Group of Seven, comprised of the world’s largest economies, which released a statement on Wednesday voicing concern over China’s live-fire exercises and urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. The exercises have also caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, with some international flights canceled and vessels urged to use alternative routes for several ports around the island. On Tuesday, the Chinese Defense Ministry said it would hold its exercises in six zones around Taiwan, warning ships and aircraft to stay out of the areas during the drills. The Taiwan Strait is a key trade route for vessels carrying goods between major economies in northeast Asia such as China, Japan, and South Korea, and the rest of world.

206,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/media/economy-paul-krugman-reliable-sources/,"""articleBody"":""Even top economists are struggling to explain perhaps “the weirdest economy” Americans have ever lived through, CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on “Reliable Sources” Sunday.  Paul Krugman, a Nobel Laureate and economist and a longtime columnist for the New York Times, said the economy is not in recession, but added that the distinction doesn’t even matter. “Jobs are abundant, although maybe the job market is weakening. Inflation is high, though maybe inflation is coming down,” Krugman said. “What does it matter whether you use the R word or not?” But in today’s divisive environment, the debate over whether or not to use the word recession by some members of the media has become “especially vitriolic,” Krugman said.  “I’ve never seen anything as bad as the determination of a lot of people to say it’s a recession,” Krugman said. “It’s above and beyond anything I’ve ever seen.” Negative news stories often get the most attention, Krugman added, but when it comes to the economy, a plurality of voters appear to not be aware of its underlying strength. “I think that what’s happening now is that there’s been a kind of a negativity bias in coverage,” Krugman said, pointing to a “media failing” when it comes to accurately covering the realities of what most Americans are experiencing in this economy.  “If you ask people how’s your financial situation, it’s pretty favorable,” Krugman said. “You ask them how’s the economy, they say, ‘Oh, it’s terrible.’” And partisanship is a large driver of that divide.  “They want their Biden recession,” Krugman said. “They’re going to have it, nevermind the fact that … there’s not a recession in any technical sense.” Krugman agreed that it is a complicated economic picture, and that a lot of the numbers aren’t consistent with each other, but that too is not surprising.  “We’re recovering from a pandemic,” Krugman said. “You’d expect a lot of things to look kind of weird right now.”   "",",Brian Stelter;Paul Krugman,New York Times;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMISTS,32;MEDIA_MSM,694;ECON_INFLATION,458;ECON_INFLATION,491;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,458;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,491;WB_442_INFLATION,458;WB_442_INFLATION,491;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,139;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,694;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1213;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,139;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,694;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1213;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,139;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,694;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1213;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,97;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1295;TAX_FNCACT_CORRESPONDENT,153;GENERAL_HEALTH,1863;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1863;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1863;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1863;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1863;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1863;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1863;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1863;ELECTION,1032;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1093;WB_2670_JOBS,389;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,389;WB_470_EDUCATION,389;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,389;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,389;TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMIST,246;TAX_FNCACT_COLUMNIST,269;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,133;USPEC_POLICY1,87;USPEC_POLICY1,311;USPEC_POLICY1,1008;USPEC_POLICY1,1328;USPEC_POLICY1,1445;EPU_ECONOMY,87;EPU_ECONOMY,311;EPU_ECONOMY,1008;EPU_ECONOMY,1328;EPU_ECONOMY,1445;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,87;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,311;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1008;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1328;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1445;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1510;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,610;",New York;Americans

397,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/love-language-improve-relationship-wellness/,"""articleBody"":""Editor’s Note: Psychologist John Duffy, author of “Parenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety,” practices in Chicago. He specializes in work with teens, parents, couples and families. Married and intimate couples are often looking for ways to maximize satisfaction and compatibility. Countless self-help books, seminars and relationship experts have weighed in on what they feel are the keys to a couple’s happiness and longevity. The ideas have varied quite a bit, including the amount of time spent together, shared interests and similar levels of intelligence, not to mention degrees of fondness and admiration for one another.  It’s often said that longtime partners develop their own language, a shorthand from building a strong bond. In the same vein, consider the five love languages, which are acts of service, gift-giving, physical touch, quality time and words of affirmation.  Thirty years ago, author, speaker and marriage counselor Gary Chapman wrote “The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate.” If you learn which language your partner favors and act in accordance with that language, the theory goes, you will find more satisfaction and longevity in your relationship. Conversely, you waste time and energy if you exert effort in other areas. This energy, Chapman argued, can even be counterproductive, as your partner may feel neither heard nor understood.  Being attuned to a partner’s love language was associated with both relationship and sexual satisfaction for heterosexual couples, found a June study published by the journal PLOS One. In particular, people who expressed their affection in the way their partner preferred to receive it experienced greater satisfaction with the relationship and were more sexually satisfied compared with those who met their partner’s needs to a lesser extent. I interviewed relationship experts on how they use this concept in their work and how it might be useful in enhancing relationship satisfaction. Do you use the 5 love languages in your work, and do you find them helpful? Bela Gandhi, founder of the Chicago-based Smart Dating Academy, uses the love languages regularly, but she pointed out there are some misunderstandings about how they are best used in relationships. She suggested that most people want all five, but their preferences vary depending on the day and the context. A continuous single preference is a myth, she said. “I find that these love languages are not absolute,” Gandhi said. “We may favor one at a point in time, but that may well vary over time as well.” Laura Berman, a love, sex and relationship therapist in Los Angeles and author of “Quantum Love: Use Your Body’s Atomic Energy to Create the Relationship You Desire,” takes a slightly different approach.  Berman finds the love languages to be a helpful jumping-off point to educate her clients. The love languages allow people to realize, she suggested, that love on its own is not enough. It needs to be acted upon in a way that makes a partner feel loved and seen.  “What I like about the love languages is that they are great prompts to talk about with your partner,” Gandhi added. “We tend to understand our own love languages. But in my work and my own relationship, people often don’t go out of their way to do the same for their partner.”  Gandhi and Berman agreed that love languages are helpful because they allow an individual or couple to gauge where they stand in a relationship. “I encourage my clients to ask themselves whether they are doing a pretty good job across all five languages,” Gandhi said, “even if one or two of them are favored by your partner.”  Is it important that couples have the same love language? “No, not at all. Love languages are as varied as can be,” Berman said via email. She indicated there are actually many more than the traditional five languages. She said she feels finding a partner with the exact same language could be impossible, but more importantly, love languages aren’t about people learning to love the exact same way as their partners. Rather, the theory of love languages is about learning that we all experience reality differently and have unique and sometimes mysterious internal lives.  The way to achieve longevity and satisfaction is not by speaking the same love language as your partner, Berman said, but honoring that your partner may experience the world differently than you and making a commitment to seek out ways to make your partner feel loved. It’s about bringing the energy you want to experience into your relationship, rather than waiting for a happy ending to be handed to you, she said.  Is it important to know and respond to your partner’s love language? Gandhi agreed that it’s important to respond to a partner’s preferred love language but also to recognize there isn’t just one playbook. One day, your partner might need quality time from you. But on their birthday, for instance, they might want a gift. They may need physical affection on another day.  And along with the five love languages, other needs may arise in relationships, including good listening skills or knowing when to provide your partner some space, either physically or emotionally.  Instead of following a love language playbook, Berman said, partners need to be curious about how to satisfy one another. Vulnerability is a necessity, so focus on learning what barriers you may have erected to prevent you from being seen or heard.  Can it be problematic not to know your partner’s love language? It’s problematic to have a relationship that isn’t built on communication, consistency and shared intentions to protect and nourish your bonds, Berman said.  “Love languages are just one resource you can use to help deepen your bond, but for many people, they just take the online love language quiz and sort of forget about it shortly thereafter. If you actually use the information to actively make choices to celebrate your love and nourish your relationship, then it can be very helpful,” she said via email.  Gandhi agreed but placed an emphasis on the utility of discussing the five languages. She suggested couples talk about the five languages and understand what each partner feels like is their most consistently important one or maybe two.  A discussion might start with, “Hey, I know quality time is really important to you. Do you feel like we’ve shared enough quality time together?”  Overall, it’s helpful for couples to talk about the love languages and make sure they’re happy with the love they’re receiving. And to maximize satisfaction and longevity, open communication around relationship needs is critical.  After all, as I know from my own practice, couples want their partner to feel loved the way they want to be loved. Talking through the love languages may not be the sole answer, but it’s a start.

582,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/donald-trump-republican-primary-midterms/,"""articleBody"":""To be or not to be, that is the question when it comes to former President Donald Trump’s potential 2024 presidential campaign.  The man who used to occupy the Oval Office has been holding rallies and endorsing candidates across the country this primary season. And this past week provided crucial tests of his influence, from Michigan down to Kansas, across to Arizona and up to Washington state.  It is with Trump’s strength within the Republican Party that we begin our weekly journey into the numbers.  Trump is still strong among Republicans Political analysts have long wondered when, or if, Trump’s grip on the Republican electorate is going to cease. There have been plenty of articles written about how his influence may very well be on the decline.  This past week, however, offered proof that Trump remains a power center within the party. It fits with other data suggesting that while the former President may not be as powerful as he once was, he remains a force to be reckoned with in the GOP.  Trump-backed candidates swept important statewide primaries in Arizona, including for governor (where Trump’s candidate defeated the one endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence), US Senate, state attorney general and secretary of state. All of them deny the fact that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election.  Likewise, in Michigan, Trump-endorsed Tudor Dixon won the Republican nomination for governor. And US Rep. Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump last year after January 6, went down to defeat in the GOP primary to another Trump-backed election denier in the 3rd Congressional District.  Trump’s pick for Kansas governor (Derek Schmidt) won his primary as well.  The former President has been quite successful this primary season in GOP contests with no incumbents or those featuring two sitting lawmakers because of redistricting. By my count, his candidates have won slightly less than 90% of contested primaries for governor or Congress that had either no incumbents or two incumbents because of redistricting.  That’s a strong number, though down from the 96% of such primaries his candidates won in the 2020 cycle. So far, the only major contest from the past week that a Trump candidate lost was in the open primary for Washington’s 4th District. GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse advanced to the general election under the state’s top two primary system, even though he had voted to impeach Trump and had to withstand a challenge from the Trump-endorsed Loren Culp, who has been in third place.  But even Newhouse’s advancement proves the point that Trump remains a power center in the GOP. As of Sunday, Newhouse was pulling in a little more than 25% of the primary vote and only 34% of those who voted for a Republican candidate in the district. That is incredibly weak for a sitting member of Congress.  Indeed, Newhouse and California’s David Valadao, the only other Republican so far who voted to impeach Trump and made it to the November ballot, have commanded about 25% of the primary vote. And both have done so in primaries where all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, ran on the same ballot with the top two vote-getters advancing to November – which means there were a lot of non-Republicans voting.   Trump’s success in primaries this season shouldn’t be all that surprising given the national polls. His very favorable rating among Republicans is in the low 50s. This is down from around 70% at the end of the 2020 campaign, but it means that a little more than half of Republicans really like Trump. There isn’t another active candidate who comes close to that level of adoration.  Speaking of candidates who aren’t Trump, few nonincumbents have ever polled at or above where Trump is currently in early national presidential primary polls – he’s at about 50% of the national primary vote.  The non-Trump candidates to have done so in the modern primary era appear to be Democrats Al Gore, in 1998, and Hillary Clinton, in 2014. Both went on to win their party’s nomination in the next presidential election.  The closest Republicans were George H.W. Bush in 1986 and George W. Bush in 1998. Both were polling in the low 40s and would go on to win the GOP nomination.  While it is true Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been gaining on Trump nationally, he’s still about 25 points behind him.  Perhaps the best way to understand Trump’s standing in the GOP is to look at the verbs “could” and “will”. Trump could be beat if he decides to run for the Republican nomination. He will, however, be tough to beat.  A hazy picture three months before Election Day Before we get ahead of ourselves with all this 2024 talk, there’s a big election to be held this year! The 2022 midterms are only about three months away, and the picture has become more uncertain as we approach the date.  Normally, midterms follow a simple pattern. The White House party loses seats in Congress (especially the House). This is especially the case when the incumbent president has an approval rating below 50%. Biden’s approval rating is below 40%.  Yet, the generic congressional ballot keeps getting tighter. The 3-point lead Republicans held in May has completely disappeared by now. (The generic ballot usually asks respondents some form of the following question: “If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican party?”)  This is unusual. Often, the challenging party improves its position on the generic ballot over the course of the midterm cycle.  The haziness in the national environment can be tied to what voters feel are the important issues of the day. Yes, the economy is the No. 1 issue. And yes, inflation remains historically high. This has led to a decline in real disposable income per capita (i.e., the money Americans have to spend).  Yet, there are facets of the economy that are quite good or at least improving. We are tied for the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. The stock market is up. Gas prices are down from their June peak.  Moreover, there are other issues besides the economy at play. Abortion may not rank as high on the list of voter priorities as the economy, but more Americans than at any point since at least 1984 say it is a top problem. We saw this past week that abortion can motivate voters. Democrats saw a massive increase in voter turnout in Kansas compared with every other primary so far this season.  Answering the question of who will control Congress next year has become muddled in another way as well: The House and the Senate may be controlled by different parties.  Democrats will likely lose the House, even as the national picture for them improves. They just have too much exposure.  Democrats, though, are no more than a slight underdog in their effort to retain Senate control. We’ve seen good recent polling for them in battleground states such Georgia and Pennsylvania. Those same polls reveal that Republicans have had a problem nominating candidates who aren’t well liked.  The bottom line is people who are into elections are in for an exciting final three months of the 2022 campaign.  For your brief encounters: Football has begun America’s No. 1 sport got underway Thursday, with the first preseason game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Las Vegas Raiders broadcast nationally on NBC.  And despite it being a completely meaningless affair, more than 5 million people tuned in. That is a small audience given how many people watch regular season games. But in a sign of how strong a brand the NFL is, the game was by far the highest rated show of the night.  Just remember: The preseason doesn’t matter. The last two teams to lose every single regular season game in a season won every game that preseason.  Leftover data Drinkers and nondrinkers actually agree: A new Gallup poll shows that 75% of Americans believe that alcohol has a negative effect on society. This includes 85% of drinkers and 71% of nondrinkers.  Owning an electric car: While 67% of Americans favor providing incentives to increase the use of hybrid and electric vehicles, only 42% say they are at least somewhat likely to purchase one the next time they buy a vehicle, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Just 16% were very likely.  Winter is coming: As the heat rages on in much of the continental United States, winter storm warnings have been active in Alaska this weekend. It’s a sign that summer can’t last all year round. After all, we’ve lost over 20 minutes of sunlight at the end of the day in New York City over the past few months."",",Donald Trump;Tudor Dixon;Peter Meijer;David Valadao;Joe Biden;Ron Desantis;Al Gore;Derek Schmidt;Loren Culp;Mike Pence;Hillary Clinton;Dan Newhouse,Pew Research Center;Republican Party;Republican Party;White House;Us Senate;Oval Office;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"ELECTION,1344;ELECTION,1582;ELECTION,2346;ELECTION,4027;ELECTION,4547;ELECTION,4630;",Pennsylvania;White House;Kansas;Americans;United States;Alaska;America;Arizona;Georgia;Michigan;New York;Jacksonville;Washington;Las Vegas;California;Florida

4,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/veteran-burn-pits-what-matters/,"""articleBody"":""A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The recipe for a good old-fashioned Washington cluster is all here: What are burn pits? How have they caused cancer in veterans? Read this from CNN’s Paul LeBlanc.  In short: “Burn pits were used to incinerate all sorts of waste, hazardous material and chemical compounds at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. Eighty-six percent of post-9/11 veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan say they were exposed to burn pits, according to a 2020 survey by the nonprofit Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.” What’s Toomey’s gripe? It’s an accounting dispute  The GOP’s ringleader obstructing passage of the burn pits legislation is Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a budget hawk who is retiring from the Senate and so is no longer facing voters. His problem is the versions of the bill considered earlier this year assumed money for the burn pits care would be appropriated in the regular appropriations process each year by the Senate. The version senators are currently considering would make the fund essentially permanent and place it in the category of “mandatory” spending, meaning it’s guaranteed forever, but also could create some coveted space in the discretionary budget.  Toomey’s specific concern is Section 805 of a very long bill text. With the title “Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund,” the language makes clear that, “No amount appropriated to the Fund in fiscal year 2023 or any subsequent fiscal year pursuant to this section shall be counted as discretionary budget authority and outlays or as direct spending …” Toomey is unapologetic for opposing this tweak and standing in the way of the bill.  He explained his position on “State of the Union” on Sunday, in a long conversation with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “We are spending way too much money, to use – to hide behind a veterans bill the opportunity to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending spree is wrong,” Toomey said. He worries that by switching the burn pits fund from discretionary to mandatory spending, it would free up $400 billion in space on the discretionary spending books that lawmakers will use for something else. “Now when you create that big hole, guess what happens to that big hole,” Toomey said on the Senate floor last month. “It gets filled with spending on who knows what. That’s what’s going on here.” It may be a valid gripe, but a bill to help veterans sickened by burn pits while they were at war is an awkward place to make a stand.  It’s even more awkward since 25 Republicans who voted for a previous version of the bill are now standing in its way. What do veterans say? Veterans protesting around the clock on Capitol Hill argue any wait is too long. They want the bill passed now. And they’re worried that if the spending isn’t made part of the mandatory budget, it could be taken away in the future. Matt Zeller, a major in the US Army Reserves and an adviser to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN from Capitol Hill that his activist group knows of veterans in despair today. “When people get sick from these cancers, they’re having to mortgage their homes just to be able to stay alive,” he said. “You know, people think that this is covered by the VA – it’s not. And this bill would fix that for over 3.5 million of us who are exposed to burn pits.” What’s the answer to Toomey’s complaint? Supporters of the bill say Toomey is seeing a mirage. “If you look in the bill for $400 billion that he’s talking about, you won’t see it,” Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough told Tapper after Toomey’s appearance. McDonough said Toomey’s approach would put an annual cap on how much could go into the fund, potentially end the fund after 10 years and even possibly require care to be withheld from veterans seeking care after exposure to burn pits. “If his estimations are wrong about what we will spend in any given year, that means that we may have to ration care for veterans,” McDonough said of Toomey. What’s the subtext here? Republicans feel played that Democrats are on the cusp of using reconciliation – a very different budget gimmick both sides have used in recent years – to pass health care and climate legislation.  The deal among Democrats for the health and climate legislation was hatched at the last minute with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. It was announced just after Republicans helped pass a bipartisan bill to prop up a US semiconductor industry. Lawmakers of all stripes want to wrap up their work and get out on the campaign trail for the rest of August since the November midterm election is fast approaching. Possible ways out Republicans could buckle to public pressure to allow a vote on the measure, which has plenty of support to pass. Democrats could buckle to Republican pressure to allow consideration of amendments and potentially changing budget language in the bill. Or, neither side buckles and the burn pits legislation dies.  Both sides want to pass the bill, ultimately. Republicans probably won’t mind if it takes a bit longer and further complicates Democrats’ other priorities."",",Pat Toomey;Joe Manchin;Paul Leblanc;Jake Tapper;Matt Zeller;Denis Mcdonough,Union On;Senate Republicans;Veterans Affairs;Us Army;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cost Of War Toxic Exposures Fund,"EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,344;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,493;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,370;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3169;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,4678;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5048;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5317;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5678;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,370;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3169;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4678;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5048;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5317;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5678;ELECTION,765;ELECTION,5263;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,232;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,552;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,833;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,1057;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,1196;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,2490;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3043;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3262;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3278;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3605;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3702;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,4181;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,4437;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,4611;USPEC_POLICY1,409;USPEC_POLICY1,1369;USPEC_POLICY1,1873;USPEC_POLICY1,2170;USPEC_POLICY1,3473;USPEC_POLICY1,4777;USPEC_POLICY1,5534;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,409;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,1369;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,1873;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,2170;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,3473;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,4777;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,5534;",Pennsylvania;Capitol Hill;West Virginia;America;Washington;Afghanistan;Iraq

China also suspended cooperation on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, legal assistance on criminal matters and the combat of transnational crimes, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a briefing Friday.  It suspended its anti-drug cooperation with the US, which has already been strained in recent years. The US has blamed China for failing to stop synthetic opioids reaching the US as both Beijing and Washington disagree on how to counteract the problem. China’s Foreign Ministry also said it would suspend climate change talks, a major area of cooperation despite escalating tensions in recent years.   The moves come after Beijing announced that it would sanction Pelosi and her immediate family over the visit to Taiwan, and as it stepped up military drills and warplane incursions around the island. Earlier Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry condemned Pelosi for what it described as her “vicious and provocative actions,” saying her trip to Taiwan amounted to “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs.”  “U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted on visiting Taiwan in disregard of China’s serious concerns and firm opposition, seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs, seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampling on the one-China principle, and seriously threatening the peace and stability across Taiwan Strait,” a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday.  “In response to Pelosi’s vicious and provocative actions, China has decided to impose sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family,” the statement said. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan on Wednesday, when she met President Tsai Ing-wen and other leaders, has infuriated China’s Communist Party, which views the self-governed democratic island as its territory – despite never having controlled it.  At a news conference in Tokyo during the last stop of her Asia tour, Pelosi struck a defiant tone, saying China had sought to isolate Taiwan from the international community but would not prevent US officials from traveling there. “We will not allow (China) to isolate Taiwan,” the California Democrat said Friday. “They are not doing our travel schedule.” The White House summoned the Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, on Thursday to condemn China’s “irresponsible” military activities following Pelosi’s trip, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post.    Ahead of the visit, Beijing had warned it would take “forceful measures” if Pelosi went ahead, and on her departure it launched live-fire military exercises and sent missiles over Taiwan for the first time.   Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said as of 11 a.m. Friday, several Chinese military jets and warships had conducted exercises around the Taiwan Strait and crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings, air patrol forces, naval ships, and shore-based missile systems, the ministry said. On Thursday, China sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), all of them crossing the median line.  A number of countries, including from the G7 grouping of some of the world’s largest economies, have criticized China’s drills, urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. In her comments on Friday, Pelosi said the visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo. “It’s about the Taiwan Relations Act, the US-China policy, all of the pieces of legislation and agreements that have established what our relationship is – to have peace in the Taiwan Strait and to have the status quo prevail,” she said. Pelosi also rejected suggestions by some critics that her visit had more to do with burnishing her legacy than benefiting the island, calling the claim “ridiculous.”  She pointed to Taiwan’s “free and open democracy,” successful economy and relatively progressive LGBTQ rights. “This isn’t about me – it’s about them,” she added. “It’s about Taiwan, and I am proud to have worked over the years to showcase the concerns that they have with mainland China.” Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday called for an immediate halt to China’s drills, saying they were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people.”  Earlier, Japan lodged a formal complaint after five Chinese missiles landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone. Amid worsening relations, China canceled a planned meeting between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers. On Thursday, China’s Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li summoned envoys to China from European countries, the EU and Japan in protest of their statements regarding Taiwan. The G7 statement “distorts the facts” and is a “blatant political provocation,” said Deng, who accused the countries involved of interfering with China’s internal affairs. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan was the first by a sitting House speaker in 25 years, since then-House Speaker Speaker Newt Gingrich’s visit in 1997. Her Asia tour also included stops in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.

Alina Fernández, daughter of the former Cuban dictator who died in 2016, has told Deadline she supports Franco playing her father in the forthcoming independent film “Alina of Cuba.” “James Franco has an obvious physical resemblance with Fidel Castro, besides his skills and charisma,” she told the publication.  There had been public outcry from some over Franco’s casting, including from actor John Leguizamo, because the actor is not Latino. “How is this still going on? How is Hollywood excluding us but stealing our narratives as well?” Leguizamo posted on his verified Instagram account. “No more appropriation Hollywood and streamers! Boycott! This F’d up!,” he wrote. “Plus seriously difficult story to tell without aggrandizement which would b wrong! I don’t got a prob with Franco but he ain’t Latino!”  The film tells the story of Fernández, who was born as the result of a love affair between Cuban-born socialite Natalia “Naty” Revuelta and Castro.  “I’m sure that Mía Maestro, an actress I admire, will understand and interpret Naty, my mother, in a unique way and I can’t wait to see her building her character,” Fernández told Deadline.  “The project is almost entirely Latino, both in front and behind the camera,” she added."",",Alina Fern;Natalia Naty Revuelta;James Franco;James Franco;John Leguizamo;Fidel Castro;Fidel Castro,Instagram;Cnn,"WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,335;WB_470_EDUCATION,335;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,335;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,335;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1211;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,455;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,490;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,195;KILL,131;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,131;TAX_FNCACT_SOCIALITE,1025;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,1103;TAX_FNCACT_DICTATOR,122;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,122;",Hollywood;Cuban;Cuba

Pelosi is leading a Congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific and plans to visit places including Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, according to a statement released by her office on Sunday. The statement made no mention of Taiwan, despite speculation in recent days that Pelosi might be planning to visit the self-governing democracy of 24 million people. China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory – despite never having controlled it – has warned against Pelosi visiting the island, and US President Joe Biden recently let slip that the US military thinks such a trip would be “not a good idea right now”. However, US lawmakers on both sides of Washington’s political divide have urged her to go. “Today, our Congressional delegation travels to the Indo-Pacific to reaffirm America’s strong and unshakeable commitment to our allies and friends in the region,” Pelosi said in the statement released by her office.  She said high level meetings will be held in each country to “further advance our shared interests and values, including peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance.” Pelosi said the delegation had received a briefing from United States Indo-Pacific Command leadership after a fuel stop in Hawaii, where they visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial and the USS Arizona. Traveling alongside Pelosi as part of the Congressional delegation are Chairman Gregory Meeks (Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Chairman Mark Takano (Chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs), Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Congressman Andy Kim. “Under the strong leadership of President Biden, America is firmly committed to smart, strategic engagement in the region, understanding that a free and flourishing Indo-Pacific is crucial to prosperity in our nation and around the globe,” Pelosi said."",",Raja Krishnamoorthi;Gregory Meeks;Suzan Delbene;Andy Kim;Mark Takano;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden,China Communist Party;House Committee On Veteran Affairs;House Foreign Affairs Committee,"TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2029;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2065;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,227;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,968;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1831;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,227;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,968;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,1831;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,911;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1529;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,858;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,858;TAX_FNCACT_VETERAN,1977;EPU_ECONOMY,1461;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1461;GENERAL_HEALTH,1500;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1500;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1500;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1500;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1500;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1500;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1500;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1500;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,579;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1514;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1491;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSWOMAN,2001;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1855;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1925;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,585;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1536;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1536;DEMOCRACY,541;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,541;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,30;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1521;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1560;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1560;LEADER,730;LEADER,2118;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,730;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2118;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,1468;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,1521;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,1521;",Japan;Hawaii;Taiwan;Hong Kong;Singapore;United States;Arizona;America;Washington;Malaysia;South Korea;Pearl Harbor;China
573,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/biden-mar-a-lago-fbi/,"""articleBody"":""The White House on Tuesday largely declined to answer questions on the FBI’s search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, instead emphasizing President Joe Biden’s belief in the independence of the Justice Department. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing on Tuesday that Biden was not briefed ahead of the search taking place at Mar-a-Lago and neither Biden nor any other official inside the White House was made aware of the operation ahead of time. “No, the President was not briefed, was not aware of it. No one in the White House was given a heads up,” Jean-Pierre told reporters, later adding, “We learned about this just like the American people did.”  Jean-Pierre said Biden and White House officials learned about the the FBI executing a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago – Trump’s Florida resort – from public reports when the news broke on Monday. Three people familiar with the situation have told CNN that the search was made as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there.  The National Archives had previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records, including records that contained classified material, were recovered from Mar-a-Lago. The search began early Monday morning and was focused on the areas where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that the Justice Department conducts investigations independently, and the White House leaves law enforcement matters to them. She declined to say whether the White House is aware whether Attorney General Merrick Garland personally signed off on the search.  She added that it “would not be appropriate” for the White House to comment on ongoing criminal investigations. Biden, Jean-Pierre said, believes in the rule of law and the independence of Justice Department investigations.  US Secret Service were in contact with the FBI ahead of the search, a person familiar with the matter said.  In a statement confirming the search at his Palm Beach property, Trump said FBI agents “even broke into my safe” during the operation.  “My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said Monday evening. The former President was at Trump Tower in New York when the search warrant was executed in Florida, a person familiar told CNN. Trump is expected to announce his 2024 White House bid in the coming months, even as his legal problems are mounting on multiple fronts – including two known active Justice Department investigations.  Republicans have rushed to Trump’s defense following the search, with many calling on the FBI to explain the reasoning behind the operation.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy alleged that the Department of Justice “has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.”  McCarthy in a tweet told Garland to “preserve your documents and clear your calendar,” warning of an oversight probe “when” Republicans take back the chamber in the midterm elections this November.

406,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/media/alex-jones-punitive-damages-sandy-hook/,"""articleBody"":""A Texas jury has decided to penalize Alex Jones with $45.2 million in punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victim Jesse Lewis. Plaintiffs Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis were awarded a total of just under $50 million in both compensatory and punitive damages. Of the total $49.3 million, the $45.2 million in punitive damages may be reduced due to Texas statute. “Care and concern is so important and we saw what happens when there is a dearth of that, and so I hope that we all just go home tonight and everybody that’s reading these articles and hearing this message and you chose love with your kids, because you can,” Lewis said Friday after learning of the jury’s decision. “That means being present in the moment with them, looking into their eyes, giving them a hug and just moving from there. Just every moment, realize that you have a choice and your choice is love.” The jurors began deliberating around 12:30 pm CT on Friday, after Judge Maya Guerra Gamble reminded them that in a default judgment against him Jones was already found liable for defamation and “intentional infliction of emotional distress” against Lewis and Heslin. In an emotional closing argument Friday, Lewis and Heslin’s attorney Wesley Todd Ball had said to the jury, “We ask that you send a very very simple message, and that is, stop Alex Jones. Stop the monetization of misinformation and lies. Please.” After the jury’s decision was announced in court, Jones’ attorney, Andino Reynal, immediately raised the issue of Texas law and the amount of punitive damages. Following the proceeding, he addressed it again while speaking outside the court. “We think the verdict was too high. As for punitive damages, Texas law caps them at $750,000 per plaintiff so this verdict today amounts to $1.5 million in punitives. Alex Jones will be on the air today, he’ll be on the air tomorrow, he’ll be on the air next week. He’s going to keep doing his job holding the power structure accountable. That’s our only statement,” Reynal said after court. Judge Gamble acknowledged Reynal’s objection in court but did not immediately rule on it. “So we do have laws in Texas where we claim to trust our juries and then we don’t trust our juries, and that’s true,” Gamble said at the time. “And I’m sure the judgment will properly reflect that laws of Texas in that regard, so don’t need to worry about that.”  CNN has reached out to an attorney for the plaintiffs for comment on Reynal’s argument. During closing arguments, Ball had urged the jurors to “deter Alex Jones from ever doing this awfulness again” and “to deter others who may want to step into his shoes.” Reynal had argued for a far lower sum, suggesting that the jurors should multiply Jones’ purported earnings per hour of $14,000 and the 18 hours that he said Jones talked about Sandy Hook on Infowars, for a sum of around a quarter million dollars.  On Thursday, in the first phase of the trial, the jury awarded the parents $4.1 million in compensatory damages, a far smaller amount than the $150 million the parents’ attorneys had sought. In his closing argument, Ball thanked the jury for their decision to award the $4.1 million, saying it had already made a huge difference in the parents’ lives, and asked them to award enough in punitive damages to bring the total to $150 million.  Punitive damages are a form of punishment for a defendant’s behavior. Jones, the head of the conspiratorial media outlet Infowars, repeatedly lied about the Sandy Hook massacre. He stoked conspiracy theories about the victims and their families, prompting multiple defamation lawsuits. He has since acknowledged that the mass shooting occurred. Jones claimed in his testimony that a jury award of just $2 million would destroy him financially. But on Friday morning the jurors heard testimony about Jones’ wealth from an economist, Bernard Pettingill, Jr., who estimated Jones has a net worth of between $135 million and $270 million. Pettingill, Jr., who examined several years of records for Jones and Infowars’ parent Free Speech Systems, said Jones used a series of shell companies to hide his money. Jones used two large loans to make it appear he was broke when in fact he was not, Pettingill, Jr. testified.  “Alex Jones knows where the money is, he knows where that money went and he knows that he is going to eventually benefit by that money,” Pettingill, Jr. said. After one of the jurors asked about the difference between Jones’ money and his company’s money, Pettingill, Jr. said “you cannot separate Alex Jones from the companies. He is the companies.” Jones “monetized his shtick,” he added, even suggesting that Jones could teach a college course about his techniques.  Jones’ fear-mongering rants on Infowars have, for many years, been paired with ads for supplements, documentaries, and other products Infowars sells. Pettingill, Jr. said the money poured in, identifying nine different companies that are owned by Jones.  “He is a very successful man, he promulgated some hate speech and some misinformation, but he made a lot of money and he monetized that,” Pettingill, Jr. said on the stand. “My thinking about him is he didn’t ride a wave, he created the wave.” Jones testified earlier in the week about his alleged financial troubles after social media giants like Facebook and Twitter banned his content from their platforms.  “I remember him saying that, but the records don’t reflect that,” Pettingill, Jr said. During closing arguments, Ball asserted that Jones has even more money hidden away in other places and argued that $4.1 million was a drop in Jones’ proverbial bucket. “He’s probably already made it back in donations” from fans, Ball said.

502,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/bidens-kentucky-trip/,"""articleBody"":""President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are scheduled to travel to Kentucky on Monday after deadly floods in the eastern part of the state killed more than three dozen people and destroyed communities.  The Bidens will join Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and the state’s first lady, Britainy Beshear, in visiting families affected by the flooding. They will survey recovery efforts at a local Federal Emergency Management Agency State Disaster Recovery Center, according to the White House.  At least 37 people are dead after heavy rains led to widespread flooding last week. Rescue workers continue to search for those who are missing. The flooding has destroyed communities, swept away entire homes and displaced thousands of Kentuckians. It has also knocked out essential power and water utilities, some of which has yet to be restored.  Many remain stranded without access to clean water, electricity and critical supplies. The governor has said heavily damaged infrastructure has made some communities nearly impossible to access, and the high temperature and humidity are also posing a challenge.  The trip announcement comes as the President continues to isolate at the White House as he is still testing positive for Covid-19.  Biden has tested positive every day since Saturday, when he first tested positive for his rebound case of the virus. The President’s doctor has been providing daily updates on his condition and said Friday that Biden “continues to feel very well” and that his cough “has almost completely resolved.”  The President is experiencing a rebound case of the virus after first testing positive for Covid-19 on July 21 and completing a five-day course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. The White House has several in-person events planned for next week, which are expected to only take place as planned if the President tests negative for Covid-19 and emerges from isolation.   Biden, 79, is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19 due to his age, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization and death for older adults.

The two-paragraph order from DC District Judge Amit Mehta rejects Trump’s claim that he has immunity from these lawsuits because his actions fell within his presidential duties. US Capitol Police officers Briana Kirkland and Marcus Moore, along with Washington, DC Metropolitan Police officers DeDivine K. Carter and Bobby Tabron, allege Trump is responsible for the Capitol attack. Tuesday, Mehta cited his ruling from February in a similar case involving Capitol Police officers suing Trump for their injuries where he sided with the officers. “The court already rejected President Trump’s assertion of immunity,” Mehta said in the brief order. “The court does so again.” In the previous order, Mehta wrote that Trump’s alleged actions did not fall into the “outer perimeter” of official presidential responsibilities because they were “entirely concern[ed] with his efforts to remain in office for a second term.”"",",Amit Mehta;Donald Trump;Bobby Tabron;Briana Kirkland;Marcus Moore,Capitol Police;Capitol Police;Us Capitol Police;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Dc Metropolitan Police,"TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,118;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,419;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,523;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,874;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,938;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1255;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,20;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,261;TRIAL,89;TRIAL,333;LEADER,147;LEADER,978;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,147;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,978;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,147;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,978;SECURITY_SERVICES,109;SECURITY_SERVICES,410;SECURITY_SERVICES,514;SECURITY_SERVICES,865;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,109;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,410;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,514;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,865;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,109;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,410;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,514;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,865;WB_1428_INJURY,166;WB_1428_INJURY,905;WB_1406_DISEASES,166;WB_1406_DISEASES,905;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,166;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,905;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,166;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,905;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,166;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,905;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,166;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,905;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,693;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,773;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1190;",Washington

Neither inflation nor a global pandemic can stop the gig economy, it seems.   In fact, we’re Uber-ing and Airbnb-ing more than ever in 2022, defying predictions that the sharing economy would collapse in the era of Covid.   Here’s the deal: It’s the summer of sharing … and side hustling. Got a thing that you own? There’s probably a market for people who’ll pay to borrow it. Your house, car, your boat, even your swimming pool can become a lucrative asset if you’re willing to rent it out. And it seems supply and demand are both going strong:   At this point, Uber and Airbnb are the old guard of the gig economy – disruptors who’ve become establishment and inspired a whole new class of sharing-minded startups that have flourished in the Covid era.   A couple of forces are buoying (pun intended) those businesses, and neither are particularly uplifting:   (Side note: A bit surprisingly, Julia reports, all this Uber-ing and going out to eat and renting vacay homes isn’t translating to a rebound for dating apps. The CEO of Match Group, which owns Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, said that “while people have generally moved past lockdowns and entered a more normal way of life, their willingness to try online dating products for the first time hasn’t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.”) BOTTOM LINE: The gig economy emerged as much out of necessity as it did desire. Not to beat a dead horse but, um, Millennials got pretty well screwed out of the Homeownership Dream, let alone the Second Homeownership Dream or the Let’s Get a Boat Dream. As a result, we don’t value ownership the same way our parents did. We share because that’s how we’ve gotten by. Dare I say we’re a less entitled generation as a result…  The pandemic may have taken the heat off the gig economy (figuratively, anyway), but as we emerge with our vaccines to mingle once more and distract ourselves from the world falling apart, sharing is caring.   NUMBER OF THE DAY: 100,000 The world’s oil-exporting countries agreed to a teeny-tiny increase in output next month of about 100,000 barrels a day. That’s a largely symbolic gesture — a nod from Saudi Arabia to President Joe Biden, who’s been pleading with OPEC to pump more oil and help bring down prices. The Saudi’s basically just said OK, Joe, here’s your thimble of oil, now run along.   Key quote: “That is so little as to be meaningless,” one Eurasia Group analyst told Reuters. “As a political gesture, it is almost insulting.”   THEY’RE BAAAAACK… Yesterday, an obscure Hong Kong-based company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange saw its shares rise 126% in a single day. Not bad…   But for a company that IPO’d less than three weeks ago, it was just the latest in a dizzying stock surge that even its executives couldn’t explain.   In less than a month, shares of AMTD Digital have shot up around 21,000%, from $7.80 apiece to $1,679. If you’re feeling some déjà vu, you’re not alone…  Here’s the deal: The Reddit army is back in action, it seems.   AMTD Digital is a firm you’ve almost certainly never heard of. The company is an arm of AMTD Idea Group, an investment bank based in Hong Kong that is also listed in New York and Singapore. The unit was founded in 2019, and provides fintech services in Asia, including a virtual bank called Airstar.  With all due respect to AMTD, it’s borrrrrring.   And yet this little-known fintech firm, which brought in just over $25 million in revenue last year, now boasts a market cap of more than $310 billion.  That’s more valuable than Shell or Costco. It’s on par with companies like Walmart and ExxonMobil, my colleague Michelle Toh reports.   Just to underscore the absurdity of this whole thing, the company released a statement basically shrugging that their extreme turn of fortune.   “To our knowledge, there are no material circumstances, events nor other matters relating to our company’s business and operating activities since the IPO date.”   LOL.   The source, it seems, is a bunch of traders on the famous (or notorious, depending on your perspective) WallStreetBets subreddit that executed a hedge-fund-destroying short squeeze in early 2021 when it piled into GameStop, AMC and other stocks they believed were undervalued.    Speculation is firmly on the Reddit crowd, but even some of those investors appeared befuddled by the surge.   According to Bloomberg, some analysts are pointing to the AMTD’s low free float, which makes it easier for big shareholders to push up the price.   “Given the speed of its ascent, I have a feeling this one will nosedive,” Oktay Kavrak, director at Leverage Shares told Bloomberg. “I hope investors take profits along the way as the inevitable crash will send HKD back to relative obscurity.”  Enjoying Nightcap?

200,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/world/asteroid-bennu-surface-ball-pit-scn/,"""articleBody"":""Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A near-Earth asteroid named Bennu has turned out to be full of surprises – the latest of which is the fact that it has a surface similar to a pit of plastic balls, according to NASA scientists.  The new revelation comes after the space agency successfully collected a sample from the asteroid in October 2020.  During the historic collection event, the sampling head of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft sank 1.6 feet (0.5 meter) into the surface of the asteroid. Apparently, Bennu’s exterior is made of loosely packed particles that aren’t bound together very securely, based on what happened as the spacecraft collected a sample. If the spacecraft hadn’t fired its thruster to back away after its quick collection of dust and rocks, it might have sunk right into the asteroid. “By the time we fired our thrusters to leave the surface we were still plunging into the asteroid,” said Ron Ballouz, an OSIRIS-REx scientist based at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, in a statement. Ballouz is a coauthor of a pair of July studies released in the journals Science and Science Advances about the discovery. Bennu is a rubble-pile asteroid shaped like a spinning top, composed of rocks bound together by gravity. It’s about one-third of a mile (500 meters) wide. “If Bennu was completely packed, that would imply nearly solid rock, but we found a lot of void space in the surface,” said study coauthor Kevin Walsh, a member of the OSIRIS-REx science team from Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, in a statement. So what might have happened if the spacecraft’s thrusters didn’t fire right away? “It may be that OSIRIS-REx would have gone deeper inside the asteroid, which is both fascinating and scary,” said study coauthor Patrick Michel, an OSIRIS-REx scientist and director of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique at Côte d’Azur Observatory in Nice, France. Fortunately, the spacecraft and its prized sample are heading back to Earth. The Bennu sample is due to land in September 2023. Bennu defies expectations When the spacecraft arrived at Bennu in December 2018, the OSIRIS-Rex team was surprised to find that the asteroid’s surface was covered with boulders. Previous observations had prepared them for a sandy, beachlike terrain. The scientists also witnessed particles from the asteroid releasing into space.  “Our expectations about the asteroid’s surface were completely wrong,” said study author Dante Lauretta, principal investigator of OSIRIS-REx at the University of Arizona, Tucson, in a statement. The spacecraft captured images of the site where it collected a sample from Bennu, which further baffled the team. Although OSIRIS-REx very gently tapped the asteroid, it kicked up a massive amount of rocky debris and left a crater 26 feet (8 meters) wide. “What we saw was a huge wall of debris radiating out from the sample site,” said Lauretta, a regents professor of planetary science and Cosmochemistry at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “We were like, ‘Holy cow!’ Every time we tested the sample pickup procedure in the lab, we barely made a divot.” Before and after photos of the touchdown site show the dramatic difference. The images reveal what looks like a depression in the surface, with several large boulders at its base. The sampling event itself likely caused this sunken landform. The dark surface of the asteroid also has more reflective dust near the collection point, showing where rocks were moved during the event. These changes are evident in the slider below.  When analyzing the spacecraft’s acceleration data, the team determined that it encountered very little resistance, about the same amount someone might feel pushing the plunger on a French press coffee maker.  Understanding more about Bennu’s composition can help scientists studying other asteroids, whether the goal is to plan missions like OSIRIS-REx or protect Earth from potential collisions with space rocks. An asteroid like Bennu, barely holding itself together, could break apart in Earth’s atmosphere, which might pose other risks even if it’s not a direct hit. “We need to keep interacting physically with those bodies because this is the only way to really determine their mechanical properties and response to external actions,” Michel said. “Images are crucial but do not give us the answer of whether they are weak or strong.” OSIRIS-REx – which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer – was the first NASA mission sent to a near-Earth asteroid, and once there it performed the closest orbit of a planetary body by a spacecraft to date. Bennu is the smallest object ever orbited by a spacecraft. The spacecraft’s souvenir from Bennu is the largest sample collected by a NASA mission since lunar rocks were brought back by Apollo astronauts.  Once OSIRIS-REx approaches Earth in 2023, it will jettison the capsule containing the sample, which will shoot through Earth’s atmosphere and parachute down in the Utah desert.  If OSIRIS-REx is still in good health after it drops off the sample, it will then start on a new expedition to study other asteroids.

134,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/blinken-npt-remarks/,"""articleBody"":""Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday called on Russia to live up to its nuclear arms control commitments, accusing Moscow of “reckless, dangerous nuclear saber rattling” as part of its war in Ukraine and warning of the negative impact the war will have on this month’s conference to recommit to the importance of nuclear non-proliferation. In remarks at the start of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference at the United Nations, the top US diplomat warned that the landmark agreement is “under increasing strain” due to not only the actions of Russia, but also of North Korea and Iran. Officials have acknowledged the challenges that Russia’s war in Ukraine will present at the review conference – which is typically held every five years but had been delayed for two due to the coronavirus pandemic – and the prospects of all parties agreeing to a consensus document at the conclusion of the month-long gathering.  In his remarks, Blinken noted that Russia had joined with the other NPT nuclear states – the United States, United Kingdom, France, and China – in a joint statement in January emphasizing the importance of avoiding nuclear war and arms races, but “the very next month, Russia launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine.” “It’s engaging in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber rattling, with its president warning that those supporting Ukraine self-defense ‘risk consequences such as you have never seen in your entire history,’” Blinken said. Earlier on Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning about the importance of the meeting. “Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” Guterres said. “We need the treaty on non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as much as ever. That’s why this Review Conference is so important. It’s an opportunity to hammer-out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster.” Unlike in January, only three of the NPT nuclear states – the US, UK, and France – released a joint statement Monday at the start of the conference, in which they called on Russia “to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour, to uphold its international commitments, and to recommit – in words and deeds – to the principles enshrined in the recent Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races Leaders’ statement,” referencing the one released in January. Blinken said Russia’s war is in violation of the UN Charter, the rules-based international order, and the Budapest Memorandum – the 1994 agreement under which Russia pledged to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and Kyiv agreed to forfeit its nuclear weapon arsenal. “What message does this send to any country around the world that may think that it needs to have nuclear weapons to protect, to defend, to deter aggression against its sovereignty and independence? The worst possible message,” he said. “And so it’s directly relevant to what’s going on here this month at the United Nations.” “Most recently, we saw Russia’s aggression with its seizure of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest such plant in all of Europe,” Blinken continued. “Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can’t and won’t shoot back because they might accidentally strike a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage.” “That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level,” he said. Blinken contrasted the actions by Moscow to those of the US, which he said has sought to avoid escalation “by forgoing previously scheduled ICBM tests and not raising the alert status of our nuclear forces in response to Russian saber rattling.” “There is no place in our world, no place in our world for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation, or blackmail,” he said. Blinken also called out North Korea for its nuclear provocations, noting that “as we gather today, Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test.” The top US diplomat said “Iran remains on a path of nuclear escalation.” “Although it publicly claims to favor return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, since March Iran has been either unwilling or unable to accept the deal to achieve precisely that goal,” Blinken said. “Getting back to the JCPOA remains the best outcome for the United States, for Iran, for the world.” CNN’s Richard Roth and Samantha Beech contributed reporting."",",,Nuclear War;Nuclear War;United Nations;United Nations;Cnn;United States;United States;Nuclear Non,"IDEOLOGY,1974;MIL_WEAPONS_PROLIFERATION,353;MANMADE_DISASTER_RADIOACTIVE,3041;ARMEDCONFLICT,208;ARMEDCONFLICT,260;ARMEDCONFLICT,679;ARMEDCONFLICT,1154;ARMEDCONFLICT,2021;ARMEDCONFLICT,2127;ARMEDCONFLICT,3262;ARMEDCONFLICT,3367;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1508;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1320;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1396;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_MILITARY_BASE,2906;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2289;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,420;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,420;WB_1024_PUBLIC_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,420;WB_1026_TREATIES,420;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,420;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,23;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,3230;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,3335;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,189;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1457;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,3625;DELAY,779;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,779;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,779;UNREST_HUMAN_SHIELD,3108;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,2050;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,2928;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,2928;LEADER,1478;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1478;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1478;WB_508_POWER_SYSTEMS,2788;WB_509_NUCLEAR_ENERGY,2788;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2788;WMD,1154;WMD,2021;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1154;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2021;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,1154;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,2021;WB_2469_NUCLEAR_AND_CHEMICAL_WAR,1154;WB_2469_NUCLEAR_AND_CHEMICAL_WAR,2021;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3101;ENV_OIL,1311;ENV_OIL,1387;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,65;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,142;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,586;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,675;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,972;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1200;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1813;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2123;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2270;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2722;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2864;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,3424;GENERAL_HEALTH,817;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,817;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,817;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,817;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,817;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,817;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,817;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,817;SANCTIONS,1269;SANCTIONS,1345;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,104;WB_2503_WEAPONS_PROLIFERATION_AND_ARMS_CONTROL,104;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,104;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,808;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3230;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3335;SOVEREIGNTY,2309;SOVEREIGNTY,2555;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1307;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1383;WB_135_TRANSPORT,3058;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,3058;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,3058;TAX_FNCACT_DIPLOMAT,486;TAX_FNCACT_DIPLOMAT,3953;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3213;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3318;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3610;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3213;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3318;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3610;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,630;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,14;",Russian;Pyongyang;North Korea;Budapest;Iran;France;Ukrainians;United States;Russia;Ukraine;Moscow;United Kingdom;Iranian;Kyiv;China
27,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/california-mckinney-fire-monday/,"""articleBody"":""A wildfire in Northern California that exploded in size over the weekend has killed at least two people, forced thousands to evacuate and grown into the state’s largest wildfire this year, with lightning Monday threatening its further expansion. The McKinney Fire broke out Friday afternoon in the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border and has since ripped through more than 55,000 acres, advancing on homes and forcing nearly 2,000 residents to evacuate Saturday, authorities said.  The blaze has become California’s largest wildfire so far this year, Cal Fire Capt. Chris Bruno told CNN. Two people were found dead Sunday morning inside a vehicle that burned in the path of the fire, the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office said. The two were found on a residential driveway along Doggett Creek Road near Highway 96, the sheriff’s office posted Monday morning on Facebook. Officials have not released any more information on them. As the weekend ended, the blaze was 0% contained, and firefighters face a long battle ahead as lightning and thunderstorms complicated efforts while the flames raced through dry vegetation. Heavy smoke over the fire helped slow its growth Sunday but also kept firefighting aircraft grounded, the US Forest Service said in a Sunday night update. Oregon state Rep. Dacia Grayber her husband, both firefighters, were camping near the California state line when they woke up Saturday to orange skies, hot wind gusts, lightning and blowing ash, she said on Twitter. They evacuated from the campground knowing one of them may return on deployment if the fire grows. “In 22+ yrs of fire I’ve never experienced anything like this fire behavior at night. It felt absolutely surreal and not just a little apocalyptic,” Grayber tweeted. The fire is just one symptom of the American West’s historic drought and the human-caused climate change crisis, which has caused more frequent and more severe wildfires. California’s persistent drought conditions have set the scene for rapid fire spread in the forest, with the fires burning extremely dry, receptive fuels, according to the forest service. Sprinting through dry brush, grass and timber, the fire activity has been extreme, with the flames running uphill, and spotting further out, according to fire officials. “Klamath National Forest is a big and beautiful forest, but it also has some steep and rugged terrain. And with that, coupled with the high temperatures, low humidity, they all come into play and make it a very extreme fire danger situation right now,” Tom Stokesberry of the US Forest Service told CNN affiliate KTVL. Over 2 million under red flag warnings Monday The fire risk could intensify Monday. “Abundant lightning” is expected through Monday, as well as scattered thunderstorms, which could spread the flames out further, according to the National Weather Service. “These conditions can be extremely dangerous for firefighters, as winds can be erratic and extremely strong, causing fire to spread in any direction,” forest service officials said in a news release. Dry thunderstorms like those occurring over the weekend happen when rainfall evaporates before ever hitting the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. More than 2 million people are under red flag warnings Monday in parts of northern California, central Oregon, eastern Washington, Montana, eastern Wyoming, western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. And it isn’t the only blaze crews have to contend with. There were 10 different wildfires burning in the Klamath National Forest Sunday afternoon, forest officials said. The fires generated their own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are created from the intense heat of the fire forcing air to rise. Tor Mason was one of the hundreds evacuated due to the McKinney Fire. He and his friends fled their homes and arrived at the Klamath River Community Center, only to find the fire closing in, he told CNN affiliate KDRV. “When I got to the community center it was almost on fire. I’m like, “Holy crap, this isn’t good,” Mason said. “So I put the … pedal to the metal and I boogied. … I heard this morning it shot up in flames.” The fire left a path of destroyed vehicles, scorched structures and haze-filled skies along Highway 96, according to video recorded Saturday by Kirk Eadie, EMS manager for Happy Camp Ambulance. About 650 firefighting personnel have converged on the blaze, attacking the flames from the ground and the air and working to defend evacuated homes. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for Siskiyou County, saying the blaze has destroyed homes and threatened critical infrastructure. Cal Fire said no information was available on structures damaged by the McKinney Fire, though Stokesberry told KTVL there were unconfirmed reports of lost structures. On Saturday, about 60 people were evacuated from the Pacific Crest Trail as the McKinney Fire approached, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon said on its Facebook page, noting the hikers were rescued from the “California side of the Red Buttes Wilderness.” CNN’s Holly Yan, Eric Levenson, David Williams, Paradise Afshar, Tina Burnside, Amanda Jackson and Claire Colbert contributed to this report."",",Gavin Newsom;Claire Colbert;Dacia Grayber;Chris Bruno;Amanda Jackson;Tom Stokesberry;Tina Burnside,Twitter;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Facebook;Us Forest Service;Us Forest Service,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,288;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,573;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1972;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2382;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2408;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2963;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3046;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3266;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3294;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3521;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3653;WB_1777_FORESTS,288;WB_1777_FORESTS,573;WB_1777_FORESTS,1972;WB_1777_FORESTS,2382;WB_1777_FORESTS,2408;WB_1777_FORESTS,2963;WB_1777_FORESTS,3046;WB_1777_FORESTS,3266;WB_1777_FORESTS,3294;WB_1777_FORESTS,3521;WB_1777_FORESTS,3653;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,288;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,573;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1972;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2382;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2408;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2963;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3046;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3266;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3294;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3521;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3653;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,288;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,573;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1972;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2382;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2408;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2963;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3046;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3266;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3294;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3521;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3653;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,3564;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1130;WATER_SECURITY,2897;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,2897;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,15;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,132;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,830;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,911;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2183;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,15;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,132;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,830;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,911;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2183;POLITICAL_TURMOIL,3885;STATE_OF_EMERGENCY,3885;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,2436;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,2764;BORDER,321;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,4326;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,4326;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,3968;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,451;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,451;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,451;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,972;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,4343;ARMEDCONFLICT,697;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,2328;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,94;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,4071;AFFECT,428;EVACUATION,428;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,539;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,3709;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1178;DISASTER_FIRE,482;DISASTER_FIRE,1269;DISASTER_FIRE,2618;DISASTER_FIRE,3110;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1990;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2418;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3224;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,1509;NATURAL_DISASTER_STRONG_WINDS,1541;",Yreka;Siskiyou;Jackson County;Oregon;Red Buttes Wilderness;Klamath;California
606,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/asia/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-tokyo-intl-hnk/,"""articleBody"":""China’s Foreign Ministry announced new countermeasures against Washington on Friday, including the suspension of climate talks, in response to Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, hours after it announced sanctions against the US House speaker.  The measures include the cancellation of future phone calls and meetings between Chinese and US defense leaders, for which future dates had not been announced, and the cancellation of annual naval meetings under the China-US military maritime consultation mechanism. China also suspended cooperation on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, legal assistance on criminal matters and the combat of transnational crimes, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a briefing Friday.  It suspended its anti-drug cooperation with the US, which has already been strained in recent years. The US has blamed China for failing to stop synthetic opioids reaching the US as both Beijing and Washington disagree on how to counteract the problem. China’s Foreign Ministry also said it would suspend climate change talks, a major area of cooperation despite escalating tensions in recent years.   The moves come after Beijing announced that it would sanction Pelosi and her immediate family over the visit to Taiwan, and as it stepped up military drills and warplane incursions around the island. Earlier Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry condemned Pelosi for what it described as her “vicious and provocative actions,” saying her trip to Taiwan amounted to “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs.”  “U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted on visiting Taiwan in disregard of China’s serious concerns and firm opposition, seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs, seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampling on the one-China principle, and seriously threatening the peace and stability across Taiwan Strait,” a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday.  “In response to Pelosi’s vicious and provocative actions, China has decided to impose sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family,” the statement said. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan on Wednesday, when she met President Tsai Ing-wen and other leaders, has infuriated China’s Communist Party, which views the self-governed democratic island as its territory – despite never having controlled it.  At a news conference in Tokyo during the last stop of her Asia tour, Pelosi struck a defiant tone, saying China had sought to isolate Taiwan from the international community but would not prevent US officials from traveling there. “We will not allow (China) to isolate Taiwan,” the California Democrat said Friday. “They are not doing our travel schedule.” The White House summoned the Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, on Thursday to condemn China’s “irresponsible” military activities following Pelosi’s trip, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post.    Ahead of the visit, Beijing had warned it would take “forceful measures” if Pelosi went ahead, and on her departure it launched live-fire military exercises and sent missiles over Taiwan for the first time.   Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said as of 11 a.m. Friday, several Chinese military jets and warships had conducted exercises around the Taiwan Strait and crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings, air patrol forces, naval ships, and shore-based missile systems, the ministry said. On Thursday, China sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), all of them crossing the median line.  A number of countries, including from the G7 grouping of some of the world’s largest economies, have criticized China’s drills, urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. In her comments on Friday, Pelosi said the visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo. “It’s about the Taiwan Relations Act, the US-China policy, all of the pieces of legislation and agreements that have established what our relationship is – to have peace in the Taiwan Strait and to have the status quo prevail,” she said. Pelosi also rejected suggestions by some critics that her visit had more to do with burnishing her legacy than benefiting the island, calling the claim “ridiculous.”  She pointed to Taiwan’s “free and open democracy,” successful economy and relatively progressive LGBTQ rights. “This isn’t about me – it’s about them,” she added. “It’s about Taiwan, and I am proud to have worked over the years to showcase the concerns that they have with mainland China.” Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday called for an immediate halt to China’s drills, saying they were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people.”  Earlier, Japan lodged a formal complaint after five Chinese missiles landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone. Amid worsening relations, China canceled a planned meeting between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers. On Thursday, China’s Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li summoned envoys to China from European countries, the EU and Japan in protest of their statements regarding Taiwan. The G7 statement “distorts the facts” and is a “blatant political provocation,” said Deng, who accused the countries involved of interfering with China’s internal affairs. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan was the first by a sitting House speaker in 25 years, since then-House Speaker Speaker Newt Gingrich’s visit in 1997. Her Asia tour also included stops in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.

230,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/parkland-trial-nikolas-cruz-victim-testimony/,"""articleBody"":""It wasn’t until Anthony Montalto was sitting next to his wife testifying in a Florida courtroom Wednesday that he realized he was wearing the same clothes he wore the last time he took his daughter Gina to a father-daughter dance.  “I was so happy to be her father,” Montalto said as he delivered his victim impact statement in the trial of Gina’s killer, who faces the death penalty for the mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school on Valentine’s Day 2018.  “Gina didn’t come home from school that day,” said Jennifer Montalto, who, along with her husband, described their daughter as an avid reader who was quick to volunteer and once saved a boy who fell into the pool where she was playing. Now there’s an empty seat at their table, she said, a bedroom where her daughter will never sleep and a front door she will never walk through – each of them objects that prompt a feeling of “unspeakable loss.”   Where their house was once was filled with laughter, Anthony Montalto said, “now there’s a deafening silence broken only by the deep sighs and soft sobbing that accompany what used to be happy memories of my children playing.” Wednesday was the third day of victim impact testimony in the trial of Nikolas Cruz, who has already pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder for the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.  More victim impact testimony is expected Thursday, the judge indicated, but jurors are also set to visit the scene of the massacre, Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ 1200 building, which has remained sealed since the shooting in order to preserve it for the gunman’s trial. Cruz will not be attending the visit. Following Wednesday’s testimony, Judge Elizabeth Scherer and attorneys for the prosecution and defense outlined the instructions that Scherer read to the jurors before they were sent home, including a recommendation that they wear closed-toe shoes.  The visit is meant to help jurors analyze the evidence presented in the trial so far, the judge explained. It will take place both outside and inside, she said, where jurors will be guided but able to explore the scene on each floor. Jurors are not to touch anything, and they may not bring phones or cameras.  The current phase of the trial is to determine Cruz’s sentence: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while Cruz’s defense attorneys are asking the jury for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. To recommend a death sentence, jurors must be unanimous. If they do so, the judge could choose to follow the recommendation or sentence Cruz to life instead. Much of the testimony – particularly from the parents of the 14 students killed – focused on all the things the victims and their families will never get to do and the irreparable damage to their everyday lives.  “Our family is broken. There is this constant emptiness,” said Max Schachter, the father of 14-year-old Alex, who loved chocolate chip cookies, playing the trombone and video games.  “I feel I can’t truly be happy if I smile,” Schachter said. “I know that behind that smile is the sharp realization that part of me will always be sad and miserable because Alex isn’t here.” Isabel Dalu, a close friend of the family of Cara Loughran, told the court about all the things the 14-year-old was looking forward to when she was gunned down: Her birthday was a week later, and she’d be old enough to get her learner’s permit. She’d recently started Irish dancing again, and she was excited to dance in the St. Patrick’s Day parade. The family had a trip to Ireland for that summer to visit family.  “She dreamed of her first date, her first kiss and falling in love,” Dalu said. “Cara dreamed of going to homecoming and prom, she dreamed of graduating at the top of her class with all of her loved ones watching.”  “But Cara didn’t make it to any of these milestones,” she added. Widow of assistant coach who shielded students testifies Fred Guttenberg, the father of 14-year-old victim Jaime, said Tuesday that her older brother, who was also a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas at the time of the shooting, “Wishes it was him.”  “He struggles,” Guttenberg said, “with the reality that he could not save his sister, and he wishes it was him.” Melissa Feis, the widow of Aaron Feis, an assistant football coach who died after throwing himself in front of students to protect them from the gunfire, wrote in a statement read in court by a friend Tuesday that he “was the doting father who every little girl wishes and dreams about.”  “I can see his light in Ariel and recognize his spirit woven into her fabric,” the statement said, referring to their daughter, as Melissa Feis sat still in court with her eyes closed.  Raising their daughter as a widow “can be overwhelming and challenging,” she wrote, and it’s painful knowing there are milestones in their daughter’s life that Feis has missed.  “Aaron isn’t here to give his fatherly guidance and advice,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking and unimaginable at times. And yet, it’s my reality.”  ‘Never again will the world feel right’ To make their decision, jurors will hear prosecutors and defense attorneys argue aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances – reasons Cruz should or should not be executed. Victim impact statements add another layer, giving the families and friends of the victims their own day in court, though the judge told the jury the statements are not meant to be weighed as aggravating factors. “We don’t have a system where it’s the victims’ families that get to decide whether you live or die if you kill their family members,” Teresa Reid, legal skills professor at the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law, has told CNN.  “We don’t have revenge. And so this is the mechanism that the family has.” The loss of her daughter Meadow Pollack, 18, has “destroyed” Shara Kaplan’s life, she told the jury Tuesday, “and my capability of ever living a productive existence.” To articulate how her daughter’s death impacted her, she said, she would have to rip out her heart and show them how it had shattered into a million pieces. And the Hoyer family will never be the same.  “We were a family unit of five always trying to fit into a world set up for even numbers,” said Tom Hoyer, whose 15-year-old son Luke – the youngest of three – was killed. “Two-, four-, six-seat tables in a restaurant. Two-, four-, six-ticket packages to events. Things like that.” But the Hoyers are no longer a family of five, and “never again will the world feel right, now that we’re a family of four,” Hoyer said. “When Luke died something went missing in me,” he said. “And I’ll never, never get over that feeling.”"",",Melissa Feis;Melissa Feis;Teresa Reid;Tom Hoyer;Tom Hoyer;Shara Kaplan;Lori Alhadeff;Lori Alhadeff;Max Schachter;Ilan Alhadeff;Ilan Alhadeff;Anthony Montalto;Anthony Montalto;Cara Loughran;Aaron Feis;Fred Guttenberg;Gena Hoyer;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Jennifer Montalto;Jennifer Montalto;Marjory Stoneman Douglas;Marjory Stoneman Douglas;Isabel Dalu,University Of Florida Levin College Of Law;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Aaron;Aaron;Cnn;Cnn;Mcdonald;Mcdonald,"EDUCATION,445;EDUCATION,707;EDUCATION,1621;EDUCATION,5615;EDUCATION,5772;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,267;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,2434;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,3689;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,4205;",Irish;Florida;Ireland
489,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/yu-and-me-books-asian-american-representation-cec/,"""articleBody"":""Editor’s Note: “United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell” airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET. Watch this week’s episode for more on Asian American representation in the media. Lucy Yu found refuge in books growing up. An only child raised by a Chinese immigrant mother in west Los Angeles, she spent a lot of time in bookstores. But it seemed that the stories she connected to most – those written by immigrants and people of color – were often relegated to a single shelf or a heritage month display. “I just wanted to walk into a place where I didn’t have to search that much,” she said. Yu, a chemical engineer by training, started researching and found an abundance of titles going back decades from authors with names or backgrounds like hers. But she said many of those books had quickly been placed on the backlist, a publishing term referring to older books that are still in print but typically aren’t being actively promoted. “I think that the publishing industry didn’t think that they were going to sell or didn’t think that people were interested in our stories,” Yu added. “But they had always been there and these authors and these writers and these stories have always been there.” Yu launched a crowdfunding campaign last year to turn her vision into reality, and hit her goal in just a few weeks, affirming that she wasn’t alone in wanting more of these books. In December, Yu and Me Books opened its doors in Manhattan’s Chinatown, and has been steadily growing since. The store now has four staff members, including Yu. The bookstore has also become a literary and community hub. Yu and Me Books has hosted conversations with immigrant authors, a pop-up book workshop and clothing swaps. And as Asian Americans in New York, including Chinatown, faced attacks against their communities, the store partnered with the nonprofit Soar Over Hate to hand out free pepper spray and personal safety devices. Yu sees room for progress in publishing  Despite this, Yu didn’t set out to open an Asian American bookstore. When she first conceived of her small business, she dreamed of a space that would reflect the rich diversity of her community. She envisioned a place dedicated to stories written by immigrants and people of color – which happened to include Asian American authors.  The space still reflects her vision. But perhaps because of Yu’s own Asian American identity, perhaps because of her bookstore’s historic location or perhaps because of a hunger among Asian Americans for authentic depictions of their communities, Yu and Me Books has since become a go-to for Asian American readers hoping to find their experiences reflected on its shelves. “It’s been really interesting seeing how I’ve kind of been pushed into the Asian American bookstores lane,” she said. “I think that if I weren’t Asian American, I may not have had to put myself within that slot.” That feeling of being pigeonholed is familiar for many Asian Americans, whether they work in media, the restaurant industry or the literary scene like Yu. For so long, Asian American representation in creative sectors has been scarce, while Asian American depictions in popular culture have been replete with tired tropes and stereotypes. So when Yu launched her community-centered bookstore last year, it came with added pressure and expectations.  While Yu has held to her mission of highlighting stories of immigrants and people of color more broadly, she’s leaned into customers’ demand for books by Asian American authors. Most of her inventory now skews toward Asian American books, she said – making Yu and Me Books a rare and special place. “As someone who’s thinking about my own identity and also a business owner, I want to be able to support whoever wants to come in and find books that represent themselves,” she said. “But I love that there is a lot of love and desire for Asian American books and representation.” Still, Yu makes it a point to both challenge and delight visitors to her store.  Her shelves include bestsellers such as Min Jin Lee’s “Pachinko” and Michelle Zauner’s “Crying in H Mart,” as well as niche titles from smaller presses. Visitors can thumb through cookbooks, romance novels, young adult novels and poetry volumes by Asian American authors – and the selection keeps growing. For a couple hours most evenings, a glass of wine in hand, Yu researches what other books she doesn’t yet know about that she might acquire. “One of my favorite things that I hear when customers come in the store (is), ‘I’ve never heard of this title before’ or ‘I’ve never seen like 40% of this inventory before.’” Yu said. “That makes me so happy because you can connect to a story that’s not necessarily being pushed by publishers.” As Yu and Me Books celebrates and showcases the breadth of works that Asian American writers have produced over decades, Yu also encourages her visitors to keep an open mind. “I also try to remind readers as much as I can that outside the Asian American experience, there’s so many books written by other immigrants that we can relate to very much,” she added. In the time that Yu and Me Books has been open, Yu said she’s seen positive changes in the publishing industry. She’s seeing more diversity in the authors who are getting published, but those authors are often called upon to be “educators of our experience,” Yu said. As exciting as it is to see these experiences represented authentically, she hopes the industry will reach a point where authors can transcend their identities. “I want authors of color to just write about unicorns or cupcakes – whatever they want to write about,” she added."",",Los Angeles;Lucy Yu,Joy Luck Club To Crazy Rich Asians;Joy Luck Club To Crazy Rich Asians;Cnn,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,593;WB_2198_CHEMICAL_ENGINEERING,593;WB_2197_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENGINEERING,593;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,393;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,2051;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,2379;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,3777;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,5370;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,114;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1697;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1972;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2101;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2163;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2429;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2521;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2634;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2740;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2895;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2963;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3087;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3202;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3276;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3569;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3683;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3861;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3924;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,4230;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,4590;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,5132;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,5300;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,948;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3152;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,5525;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,5775;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,216;MEDIA_MSM,151;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,151;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3126;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,151;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3126;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,151;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3126;EDUCATION,5649;TAX_FNCACT_EDUCATORS,5649;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1707;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2111;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2644;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,3097;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIANS,3520;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIANS,3634;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,919;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2940;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,123;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,1981;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2172;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2438;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2530;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2749;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2904;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2972;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3211;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3285;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3578;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3692;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3870;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3933;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4239;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4599;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,5141;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,5309;TAX_FNCACT_ENGINEER,593;TAX_FNCACT_STAFF_MEMBERS,1506;SCIENCE,627;IMMIGRATION,246;IMMIGRATION,1636;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANT,246;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANT,1636;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,246;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,1636;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KAMAU,39;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,236;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,236;",Americans;Manhattan;Chinese;New York;American

418,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/florida-python-challenge-everglades/,"""articleBody"":""Deer, raccoons, possums and fox once flocked the area of the Everglades National Park in south Florida. Nowadays, you’re lucky if you spot one mammal in the area, according to wildlife experts. Who’s to blame for this decline in wildlife? The invasive species known as Burmese pythons. To help combat this problem for Florida’s ecosystem, snake hunters are congregating in the hundreds for the Florida Python Challenge. The event, created by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, started in 2013. “I love snakes. I hate that we have to do this, but they’re invasive and changing the entire ecosystem.” professional python hunter Amy Siewe told CNN. According to the commission, these reptiles were detected as early as 1979 in Florida. “They were introduced to Florida through accidental and intentional release through the pet trade,” a spokesperson with the commission told CNN on Friday. Since then, they’ve killed and continue to pose a major threat to wildlife. The event brings hundreds of professional snake hunters to the Everglades to hunt and kill the reptiles. As of Friday, more than 850 people had signed up, the commission said. August 5 marked the start of this year’s 10-day challenge.  To participate, members were required to take an online training course and pay a $25 registration fee. The hunter who brings back the most pythons wins $2,500. Last year, participants killed more than 200 pythons.  Aside from the challenge, year-round removal efforts are still in play. Since 2000, more than 17,000 pythons have been removed and reported, according to the commission. Michael Kirkland, a biologist with the South Florida Water Management District, told CNN that pythons have been “decimating wildlife for years.” “The challenge is designed to remove as many pythons from the area as possible,” he said, “Human detection and removal are the most efficient and effective tools in the toolbox right now,”  Contractors hired with the water management district work year-round and participate in the challenge to capture the creatures. Kirkland said there has been up to a 90% decline of animals in the area due to pythons.  A full-time job Among the many partaking in the challenge this year are Siewe and Donna Kalil. Kalil told CNN he has been professionally hunting the reptiles since 2017. Siewe was hired in 2019. Combined, the two have killed more than 1,000 pythons – Kalil at more than 670 and Siewe at close to 400. They share a love for the creatures but understand the importance of this challenge. “The hunters are the best way we have at this moment to help with this problem,” Siewe said. Kalil grew up in Florida and said when she went to the Everglades as a kid there were “so many rabbits you couldn’t count them all.” Fast forward to the 2000s when Kalil said there were practically no rabbits, possums or raccoons as a result of the pythons. In last year’s challenge, Kalil took home the $2,500 prize for removing the most pythons at 19. She’s been participating since 2013. This will be Siewe’s third year. In her first year, she won second place for heaviest snake.  The two will base their hunting on factors like weather, time of day and sleep schedule. “This time of the year, the nighttime is best to go out,” Kalil said. And hunting doesn’t come easy. Throughout her career, Siewe has suffered from many python bites and said she doesn’t recommend it. “It’s like a warm knife going through butter,” Siewe described. Pythons, while not venomous, have hundreds of teeth that are razor sharp, according to Siewe. The creatures can grow to massive sizes and it’s a feat to take them on. Siewe said her largest capture measured 17 feet and 110 pounds, which she caught standing 5 foot 4. Kalil shares that you can’t catch them all. “I’ve had four get away from me during my career,” she said. “It can be difficult during the night in the water and weeds.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been an avid fan of the python challenge. In a June press release, he said, “I am proud of the progress we’ve made, and I look forward to seeing the results of this year’s Python Challenge.”  In fact, his wife, Casey DeSantis, said in a press conference Friday that her 10-year anniversary gift to the governor was a pair of python skin boots."",",Michael Kirkland;Donna Kalil;Donna Kalil;Donna Kalil;Donna Kalil;Ron Desantis;Thomas Aycock;Thomas Aycock;Amy Siewe;Amy Siewe;Amy Siewe;Amy Siewe;Casey Desantis,Wildlife Conservation Commission;Everglades National Park;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RABBITS,3097;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RABBITS,3200;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2003;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,876;WB_2670_JOBS,3941;WB_2670_JOBS,4419;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3941;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4419;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,3941;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,4419;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,3941;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,4419;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,3941;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,4419;LEADER,4827;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,4827;ARMEDCONFLICT,321;TAX_FNCACT_BIOLOGIST,1790;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKE,368;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKE,1031;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKE,3471;WB_427_WATER_ALLOCATION_AND_WATER_ECONOMICS,1830;WB_427_WATER_ALLOCATION_AND_WATER_ECONOMICS,2137;WB_1064_WATER_DEMAND_MANAGEMENT,1830;WB_1064_WATER_DEMAND_MANAGEMENT,2137;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTER,655;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTER,1498;TAX_WORLDFISH_FISH,476;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKES,544;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKES,3646;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKES,3764;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTERS,376;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTERS,1039;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTERS,2915;WB_698_TRADE,859;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,295;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,1211;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,1293;WB_137_WATER,1819;WB_137_WATER,2126;WB_137_WATER,4481;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,360;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,628;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3730;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3848;KILL,942;KILL,1579;KILL,2382;KILL,2473;KILL,2752;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,942;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1579;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2382;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2473;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2752;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,88;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,88;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,88;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,88;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RACCOONS,16;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RACCOONS,3221;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,34;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,203;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,256;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,487;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,988;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1893;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,976;",Everglades National Park;Florida;Burmese
391,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/entertainment/anne-heche-car-crash-sunday/,"""articleBody"":""Anne Heche is in stable condition Sunday, two days after the car she was driving crashed into a home and became engulfed in flames, a representative for the actress said. “Her family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time,” the representative said. Heche was previously in an intensive care unit with “severe burns” following the Friday crash, a source close to Heche told CNN Saturday morning. “She’s lucky to be alive,” the source said. “She has severe burns and has a long recovery ahead. Her team and her family are still trying to process what led up to the crash.” The vehicle was traveling at high speed when it ran off the road and collided with a residence, Los Angeles Police Public Information Officer Jeff Lee told CNN on Friday.  Heche was taken to a local hospital by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics in critical condition. It took firefighters more than an hour to “access, confine and fully extinguish the stubborn flames within the heavily damaged structure,” the LAFD said. There were no other injuries reported. Hours before Heche’s crash on Friday, a new episode of her podcast “Better Together” was released but has since been removed from an Apple Podcast landing page.    During part of the podcast, Heche and her co-host, Heather Duffy, discuss drinking vodka and wine, and Heche talks about having a “bad day.” It’s unclear when the podcast was recorded. CNN has reached out to Heche’s representatives for comment. “Today’s been a very unique day,” Heche says in the podcast. “I don’t know what happened, sometimes days just suck and I don’t know if you ever have them, but some days Mama says are … some days are those no good very bad days. And I don’t know why some days just end up like this, and things don’t really rock me like that.” On Saturday, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN authorities had yet to question Heche about the circumstances of the incident.  The significant nature of her injuries have prevented officers from interviewing her, the law enforcement source said.  The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the crash and a previous “misdemeanor hit and run” incident, an LAPD spokesperson told CNN on Saturday evening.  LAPD said no arrests have been made.  Heche first rose to fame on the soap opera “Another World,” where she played the dual role of twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love from 1987 to 1991 and earned a Daytime Emmy Award. She followed that with films including “Donnie Brasco,” “Six Days Seven Nights,” and “Wag the Dog.” Her romantic relationship with Ellen DeGeneres in the late ’90s resulted in intense media attention, much to Heche’s professional frustration. In a 2021 interview with Page Six, Heche said she felt “blacklisted” after going public with their relationship. “I didn’t do a studio picture for 10 years,” said Heche, who dated DeGeneres from 1997 to 2000.

592,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/entertainment/john-legend-miscarriage-abortion-rights-trnd/,"""articleBody"":""Just over a month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, musician John Legend is advocating for abortion access and reproductive rights. In an interview with David Axelrod for CNN’s “The Axe Files” podcast, Legend described his own experience with wife, model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen’s 2020 miscarriage. “Anyone who’s dealt with pregnancy knows none of this is casual, none of this is frivolous. And it’s so intimate, and it’s so personal,” he said. “Why do we want our government involved in those decisions?” Legend referenced strict abortion restrictions in certain states that have led to limits on patients’ ability to access standard miscarriage care. One woman in Texas, for instance, was forced to carry fetal remains inside her for two and a half weeks after miscarrying last year because of strict anti-abortion laws.  “Anyone who has a miscarriage, after all that trauma, all that pain, all those tears we went through, to then have the local DA or local law enforcement do an investigation and make sure the miscarriage was approved by the state… to have the government involved in that conversation in any way is so offensive to me,” he said. Teigen and Legend announced that they had lost their child after pregnancy complications in 2020. Teigen had been about halfway through with her pregnancy with the couple’s third child, whom they had started calling Jack. Teigen was vocal about the difficulties of her miscarriage, and wrote an emotional essay about the traumatic loss.  The two are parents to Luna and Miles, both conceived through IVF, and announced on Wednesday that they are expecting another child.  Government involvement in reproductive rights is “nasty, it’s evil. It should not be even a discussion. The government should not be involved,” Legend said. In his interview with Axelrod, Legend emphasized the devastating experiences of patients who undergo late-term abortions. “Anyone who makes that gut-wrenching decision at that point in the pregnancy, they’re only doing it because they have a serious reason to do it, whether it’s the health of the mother or the health of the child,” he said.  The star hopes he can use his platform to advocate for change. “I’ve grown over time in understanding how to use my celebrity and how to use the power that I have and the reach that I have and the resources that I have to actually make change.”"",",John Legend;David Axelrod;Chrissy Teigen,Supreme Court;Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,481;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1084;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1635;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1741;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,481;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1084;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1635;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1741;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,665;TAX_FNCACT_MUSICIAN,73;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,612;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1217;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1339;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1621;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,2109;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,999;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,999;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,999;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,999;GENERAL_HEALTH,2069;GENERAL_HEALTH,2096;MEDICAL,2069;MEDICAL,2096;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,979;MEDIA_MSM,270;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,311;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,651;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,853;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,1027;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,1436;LEGISLATION,821;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY_COMPLICATIONS,1247;WB_1454_EMERGENCY_OBSTETRIC_CARE,1247;WB_641_REPRODUCTIVE_AND_MATERNAL_HEALTH,1247;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1247;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1247;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,877;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,877;SECURITY_SERVICES,979;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,979;WB_840_JUSTICE,979;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,979;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,979;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,979;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,979;EPU_POLICY_LAW,967;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2318;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,346;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,1233;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,1311;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,1978;",Texas

Jose Gomez III, 21, pleaded guilty in February to three counts of committing hate crimes. CNN has reached out to his lawyer for comment. Gomez saw a Burmese family with three young children enter a Sam’s Club in Midland, Texas, in March 2020, and, believing they were Chinese, followed them into the store, according to federal prosecutors.  Gomez grabbed kitchen knives that were being sold at the store and attacked the family, slashing the father and a child who was then 6 years old, according to the criminal complaint.  Prosecutors said Thursday the blade of the knife entered millimeters from the child’s right eye, cut his ear and slashed the back of the child’s head.  A store employee who intervened was also stabbed in the leg, according to prosecutors. As the suspect was being held to the ground, prosecutors said, he yelled to the Asian family – “Get out of America!” Gomez later admitted to authorities he had attacked the family and that he targeted the father and “whoever I think came from the country who started spreading the disease around.”  Gomez told authorities he intended to kill the father and also admitted to targeting the children, the complaint said. Hate crimes across the US have risen since the onset of the pandemic, including attacks on Asian Americans, who are often brutally – and sometimes fatally – targeted and erroneously blamed for the pandemic. “It is our hope today’s sentence will help the victims with the healing process,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeffery R. Downey said in a statement. “Rest assured, the FBI and our law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue anyone who commits these violent acts to ensure the civil rights of all Americans are protected.” "",",,Sam Club In Midland;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1063;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1149;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1390;WB_1406_DISEASES,1390;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,80;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1020;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1122;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1208;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1617;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1774;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,622;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,768;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,824;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,612;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,1316;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,1453;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1627;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2036;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,289;TAX_FNCACT_SPECIAL_AGENT,1824;GENERAL_HEALTH,123;GENERAL_HEALTH,1588;GENERAL_HEALTH,1719;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,123;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1588;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1719;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,123;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1588;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1719;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,123;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1588;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1719;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,123;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1588;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1719;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,123;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1588;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1719;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,123;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1588;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1719;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,123;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1588;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1719;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1259;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1422;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1259;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1422;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1259;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1422;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1086;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1172;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1086;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1172;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1334;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,114;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,56;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,56;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,56;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,56;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,56;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1128;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1214;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1774;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1774;KILL,1442;TRIAL,44;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,669;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2019;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,2019;TAX_FNCACT_AGENT,1824;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,324;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_CRIME,254;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_CRIME,1531;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEE,861;SECURITY_SERVICES,1920;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1920;WB_840_JUSTICE,1920;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1920;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1920;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1920;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1920;LEGISLATION,1908;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1908;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,22;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,353;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1495;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,145;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,502;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,696;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,931;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,990;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,436;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,436;",Americans;America;Chinese;Texas;Florida;Burmese
138,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/biden-still-covid-positive/,"""articleBody"":""President Joe Biden is still testing positive for Covid-19 and “continues to feel well” as he experiences a rebound case of the virus, according to his physician.  Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo on Monday that the President tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test earlier in the morning, “as could be anticipated,” and continues to follow “strict isolation measures” at the White House.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that Biden is not experiencing any “recurring symptoms” and will follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and isolate for five days. Monday marked day two of that latest isolation. “He’s feeling fine,” Jean-Pierre told reporters at a White House briefing.  Jean-Pierre said, “As you know, some of you have had Covid … those symptoms that you have don’t go away right away, they kind of linger, those minimal symptoms kind of linger for some time. So you can expect that.” The President is once again isolating at the White House after emerging from isolation from his first case of Covid-19 in the middle of last week. He has not left the White House in 12 days.  O’Connor said on Saturday that the President had experienced “no reemergence of symptoms, and continues to feel quite well.” In memos on Sunday and Monday, O’Connor said the President “continues to feel well,” but made no explicit mention of symptoms.  Due to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death. The President, who is fully vaccinated and double boosted, first tested positive on July 21 and had mild symptoms for several days before ending his isolation on Wednesday following two negative Covid-19 tests. He completed a five-day course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people age 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription. But after giving a speech from the Rose Garden on Wednesday in which the President said he was “feeling great” and back to working in person, he tested positive on Saturday.  The CDC recently issued guidance saying people who test positive again and whose symptoms come back after finishing their antiviral pills should restart their isolation period and isolate for five full days. The agency says people can end their isolation period after those five additional days as long as their fever has been gone for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication and they’re feeling better. The agency also recommends that people wear a mask for 10 days after their symptoms come back."",",Kevin Oconnor;Joe Biden,White House;White House;White House;Us Centers For Disease;Drug Administration;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_PHYSICIAN,163;GENERAL_HEALTH,959;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,959;WB_1406_DISEASES,959;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,959;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,959;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1358;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1444;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1358;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1444;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1358;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1444;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1358;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1444;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1358;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1444;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1358;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1444;TAX_DISEASE_FEVER,2089;LEADER,14;LEADER,228;LEADER,426;LEADER,681;LEADER,814;LEADER,1120;LEADER,1685;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,14;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,228;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,426;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,681;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,814;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1120;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1685;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,14;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,228;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,426;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,681;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,814;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1120;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1685;MEDICAL,1588;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTOR,1588;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,980;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,980;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,980;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,980;WB_2026_PREVENTION,980;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1402;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1420;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,1420;WB_2372_AUTHENTICATION_AND_AUTHORIZATION,1420;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1420;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,394;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,469;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,614;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,63;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,257;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,546;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,921;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1299;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1502;",White House
62,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/us/kentucky-flooding-california-wildfires-drought-climate/,"""articleBody"":""Extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum has thrashed parts of the US over the past week – one of the many signals that climate change is here now, scientists say. On the one hand, overwhelming rainfall triggered two ultra-rare floods last week, one in the St. Louis area and another in eastern Kentucky that has left dozens dead or missing. On the other, a fiery drought has fueled California’s largest wildfire of the year so far – the McKinney Fire – which burned so hot over the weekend that massive pyrocumulus clouds erupted into the atmosphere. Expect more of these extremes as the planet warms, said Kevin Reed, a climate scientist at Stony Brook University, and prepare for them. “Every weather event has some flavor of climate change in it because it’s impossible to decouple them,” Reed told CNN. “It’s another sign that climate change is here. It’s not just a challenge for the next 400 years from now or 50 years from now; in reality, it’s something that we need to rapidly adjust to, adapt to and become more resilient to now.”  Climate experts anticipate heavy rain events to increase in intensity and frequency as the planet warms, since warmer air can hold more moisture. That concept is easier for most people to grasp in the case of a hurricane, Reed said.  For instance, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped more than 60 inches of rain in parts of Texas and slammed the coast with an 8-foot storm surge. Scientists have said climate change made Harvey’s rainfall more extreme. But that same process plays out over land as water evaporates from the soil, grass, crops and forests. And more moisture can be drawn out of soil and vegetation the warmer it gets.  “Part of that is the general circulation of the atmosphere-ocean system which moves air around the world and brings moisture into areas over land,” Reed said. “Another aspect is that, over the last 100 plus years, the land surface has actually warmed more than the ocean, so the largest signal that we’re actually seeing in surface temperature is occurring overland, and inland as well.”  What it adds up to is a higher risk of dangerous flooding. “While extreme events and floods have sort of always been a part of a climate cycle, they can get more frequent and they can be a lot more intense as the planet is warmed,” Beth Tellman, co-founder of flood database Cloud to Street and assistant professor of geography at the University of Arizona, told CNN. “The intensity of rainfall from the storm systems in both St. Louis and eastern Kentucky are the reality and the physical manifestation of (climate change) happening now in our lives.”  Andrew Smith, a co-founder and director at the flood modeling group Fathom, analyzed the St. Louis flooding event and noted that while there is a strong connection between the climate crisis and extreme rainfall, researchers have also pointed to population growth as one of the factors that will increase the risk and impact of flooding.  “In many ways, it’s these isolated flash flood events in urban centers that will see a lot of amplification in hazard and risk in the future,” Smith said. “We have more faith in finding (a climate change connection) to these kinds of localized extreme rainfall events.” “They do seem to be happening more frequently,” he added.  The flooding, wildfire, heat waves and drought paint a picture of a nation in peril. And as one part of the country recovers from extreme rainfall, another can be scorched by deadly fires.  The McKinney fire in Northern California, which exploded in size over the weekend to become the state’s largest so far this year, burned uncontrolled Monday amid the West’s historic drought.   The fire generated its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are triggered by intense heat that forces air to rise rapidly and are a sign of how large and hot the fire was burning.  At the same time, forecasters at the National Weather Service warned that “dry lightning” was possible Monday – a phenomenon that is made more likely by exceptional drought. The dry air evaporates the storm’s rain before it ever hits the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. The climate crisis is ultimately intensifying the water cycle, not only making dry periods drier and wet periods wetter. All this, Tellman said, is another reason why policymakers need to put more focus on adaptation – helping communities adapt to the climate crisis and grow more resilient against extreme weather. “Passing a climate bill and moving forward politically in the US is really important and linked to preventing and trying to reduce the amount of rain that’s falling from the sky that’s causing events like we’re seeing in Kentucky and Yellowstone and St. Louis,” Tellman said.  “This is a real impact on our lives, so we need more mitigation, good climate legislation, and we also have to invest in adaptation to reduce impact for the future,” she added. “It’s going to get a lot worse if we don’t limit warming.”"",",Cawx Cafirepic;Kevin Reed;Andrew Smith;Beth Tellman;Robert Shackelford,Stony Brook University;Remarkable;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;University Of Arizona,"TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,4701;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,4041;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,2639;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,20;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,5040;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,20;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,5040;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,20;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5040;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,20;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,5040;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,20;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,5040;WATER_SECURITY,367;WATER_SECURITY,3704;WATER_SECURITY,4030;WATER_SECURITY,4524;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,367;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,3704;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4030;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4524;KILL,323;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,323;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,323;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,129;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,620;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,727;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,825;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1364;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1750;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2474;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2845;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3184;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3526;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4740;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4987;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5061;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5384;LEGISLATION,5396;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5396;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,5396;SCIENCE,630;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,630;POPULATION_DENSITY,3263;WB_640_POPULATION_AND_DEMOGRAPHIC_CHANGE,3263;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3263;WB_1448_DEMOGRAPHIC_CHANGE,3263;DISASTER_FIRE,4168;DISASTER_FIRE,4339;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,235;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2429;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2396;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2915;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2975;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3110;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3332;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3670;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2396;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2915;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2975;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3110;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3332;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3670;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,4130;WB_1777_FORESTS,4130;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4130;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1576;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1616;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2611;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2611;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,2611;WB_2945_DATABASE,2611;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAVY_RAIN,1394;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2649;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3041;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,406;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,3681;NATURAL_DISASTER_STORM_SURGE,1720;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1477;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2054;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4282;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4537;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,136;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,734;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,832;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,1757;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,2852;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,3533;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,136;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,734;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,832;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1757;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2852;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3533;URBAN,3396;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,3694;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOOD,3380;EDUCATION,656;EDUCATION,2680;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,656;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2680;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1292;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,1029;WB_2120_SATELLITES,1029;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,1029;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1029;WB_137_WATER,1840;WB_137_WATER,4784;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,2602;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3054;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3380;USPEC_POLICY1,4909;EPU_POLICY_POLICYMAKERS,4909;",California;Texas;Klamath;Kentucky

672,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/europe/eu-uk-drought-warnings-weather-climate-intl/,"""articleBody"":""Sixty-three percent of land in the European Union and United Kingdom – an area nearly the same size as India – is now under either drought warnings or alerts, according to data published by the European Drought Observatory on Wednesday. The new figures mark a slight increase from a 10-day period earlier in July, with 46% of land now covered by “warnings,” which means there is a deficit of moisture in the soil, while 17% is under the more severe level of “alert,” where vegetation is stressed. The area is also bigger than the US’ three largest states – Alaska, Texas and California – combined.  A map accompanying the data shows a high concentration of the more severe alert level in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary and Romania. An update on Wednesday by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology suggested that warmer-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average rainfall was likely to affect the southeast of the country, mostly England, until October. Water companies in these areas are considering more hosepipe bans on millions of customers in coming weeks. On Monday, the EU’s climate monitoring agency Copernicus said that much of Europe experienced a drier-than-average July, with several local records broken in the west for low rainfall and drought hitting several parts of southwestern and southeastern Europe.  In its monthly climate update, Copernicus said those conditions facilitated the spread and intensification of wildfires, fueled also by back-to-back heat waves in parts of Europe, in what is shaping up to be one of the continent’s hottest summers on record. The new data comes as the world grapples with a food crisis only just abating as Russia lifts its blockade of grain exports from Ukraine. Extreme weather and supply chain issues have worsened the crisis and are likely to persist for some time.  A recent report by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s science service, forecast a drop of 8-9% in the production of grain maize, sunflowers and soybeans in the EU because of hot and dry conditions over the summer, well below the five-year average. Copernicus Senior Scientist Freja Vamborg said that “dry conditions from previous months combined with high temperatures and low precipitation rates seen in many areas during July may have adverse effects on agricultural production and other industries such as river transport and energy production.” Months with little rain In July, water reservoirs in several parts of Europe were at a very low levels, insufficient to sustain demand, according to Copernicus. Southern England experienced its driest July since records began in 1836, while the month across the United Kingdom was the driest July in more than 20 years. The UK saw just 46.3mm, or 56%, of its average rainfall for the month following a long run of drier-than-average months, with the exception of February. In France, July saw a total rainfall of 9.7mm, which made it the driest July there since records began in 1959 and represented a rainfall deficit of 85% compared to the 1991-2020 average. Meanwhile, in Italy, a lack of rain since December 2021 has hit northern parts of the country and the Po River completely dried up in places earlier this summer. In mid-July at Cremona – around halfway along the Po – the water was more than 8 meters below “hydrographic zero,” impacting hydroenergy production, agriculture and transport.  Copernicus said the situation improved as a result of rainfall towards the end of the month, which brought a 40cm increase for the river, although hydropower production in the region was still affected. July was also globally one of three warmest recorded, close to 0.4 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and the sixth-hottest July in Europe, Copernicus said.  Spain, France and the United Kingdom experienced at least one day over 40 degrees Celsius last month. In the UK, temperatures climbed to over over 40 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) on July 19 with the English village of Coningsby recording 40.3C for the first time ever.  Meanwhile, Spain reported its hottest July in over 60 years on Monday.  “July 2022 has been extremely hot in Spain, the warmest since at least 1961, with an average temperature of 25.6 ºC [78.1 Fahrenheit], which is 2.7 ºC [4.9 Fahrenheit] higher than the normal average,” the country’s national weather agency AEMET said in a post on Twitter. July was “0.2 ºC [0.4 Fahrenheit] higher than that of July 2015, which until now was the warmest month of July,” it added.

520,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-killings-monday/,"""articleBody"":""The potentially linked ambush-style shootings of three Muslim men and the recent killing of a fourth in Albuquerque have alarmed the city’s Muslim community, leaving the community grappling with fear as police announce they have detained a suspect. The killings of Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, Aftab Hussein, 41, and Naeem Hussain, 25, all have one commonality: the victims were all Muslim and of South Asian descent, according to Albuquerque police. The three most recent killings happened within the span of two weeks, putting the city on edge as police probed for potential links between the attacks, and put a spotlight on an unsolved homicide from November 2021.  Albuquerque police announced Tuesday they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, who they described as the “primary suspect” and the driver of a dark silver sedan-style vehicle authorities previously described as a “vehicle of interest.”  The suspect is being charged with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain. The FBI is assisting with the investigation, and an online portal was set up for residents to upload videos and images which might help authorities investigating the killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has also voted to increase a reward for information leading to an arrest to $20,000. “While we are still sifting through all the evidence to look for more connections, it is deeply troubling that these three men were Muslim and of similar descent,” deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division, Kyle Hartsock, previously said. Here’s what we know about the killings and the investigation so far: How did the killings happen? The most recent of the killings was reported Friday, when Naeem Hussain was found dead by Albuquerque police officers who responded to reports of a shooting just before midnight in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue. After the discovery, Albuquerque police said the homicide “may be connected” to three previous killings of Muslim men from South Asia. Those three men – Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Mohammad Ahmadi – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Hartsock previously said. Two of them, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein, were both Pakistani men and were killed in Southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue. Police said they “determined there is a connection” between those two deaths. On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT. On July 26, police responded to Rhode Island Street where they found Aftab Hussein with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car. Detectives learned that the gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle,  the complaint states. Police found that casings from both the August 1 and July 26 shootings were likely fired from the same firearm, according to Hartsock. As investigators probed those two recent killings, they turned their attention to the November 7, 2021, homicide of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan who was killed outside a business he ran with his brother on San Mateo Boulevard. Who are the victims? Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had just become a US citizen last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami. He opened his own trucking business this year and was described as being a kind, generous and hardworking person. The day he was killed, he had attended a funeral for the two recent victims and expressed fear about the shootings, according to a spokesman with a mosque in Albuquerque. Muhammad Afzaal Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor. “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.” Few details have been released about the two other victims. Police said Mohammad Ahmadi was a Muslim man from Afghanistan and Aftab Hussein was a Muslim man from Pakistan. Where does the investigation stand? Prior to the news Tuesday that a suspect had been detained, police had only released a flyer showing a “vehicle of interest” in all four killings. But it remained unclear who the car belongs to, or how they are potentially connected to the attacks. Police said the vehicle “is suspected as being used as a conveyance in recent homicides of 4 Muslim men.”  “We have a very, very strong lead. We have a vehicle of interest … we have got to find this vehicle,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller previously said. “We don’t know at this point what it is associated with, or who owns it.” While police have not definitively said all four attacks are connected, they have said they are looking into whether it is the case. “There is one strong commonality in all the victims; the race and religion,” Hartsock said in a Thursday briefing. Authorities are asking the public to come forward with any information which might help in the investigation. Tips may be submitted to the Albuquerque Metro CrimeStoppers website. Authorities are still searching for a motive behind the killings and working to confirm whether they’re all related.  Syed is now being charged with two of the homicides – of Aftab Hussein and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – and police said there is evidence “strong enough that” authorities are continuing to view Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in the other two killings as well, Hartsock said. How are local and national leaders responding? After Friday’s killing, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday she would send additional state police to Albuquerque. “I am angered and saddened that this is happening in New Mexico, a place that prides itself on diversity of culture and thought. This is not who we are,” Grisham said in a statement. “We will not stop in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families and are bringing every resource to bear to apprehend the killer or killers – and we WILL find them.” The attacks have drew condemnation from President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.  Meanwhile, local and national Muslim groups had warned residents to be cautious. “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” Islamic Center of New Mexico posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” The center said while there was no evidence its mosque is being targeted, it was still taking steps to provide additional security measures. “The lives of Albuquerque Muslims are in danger. Whoever is responsible for this horrific, hateful shooting spree must be identified and stopped – now,” stressed Council on American-Islamic Relations National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell. The Council was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible, the organization announced, calling the series of killings a “horrific, hateful shooting spree.” CNN’s Claudia Dominguez and Ashley Killough contributed to this report."",",Edward Ahmed Mitchell;Albuquerque Metro Crimestoppers;Michelle Lujan Grisham;Ehsan Shahalami;Joe

64,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/dc-man-impersonating-dhs-agent-pleads-guilty/,"""articleBody"":""Arian Taherzadeh, a Washington, DC man who impersonated a Department of Homeland Security agent while prosecutors say he ingratiated himself with federal agents through gifts and rent-free apartments, pleaded guilty on Monday and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department. The case, which put four Secret Service members on administrative leave and involved years of deception, according to court documents, continued to crystallize Monday as new charges and information were revealed during the plea hearing. Taherzadeh, along with his co-defendant Haider Ali, were charged earlier this year with falsely impersonating federal officers and possessing illegal, large capacity ammo magazines. Both men were released on home incarceration in April. Ali has pleaded not guilty.  Taherzadeh was charged with conspiring to impersonate a federal law enforcement officer as well as possession of an illegal, large-capacity ammo magazine and filming individuals, without their consent, engaging in sexual activity. He pleaded guilty to the three charges and, as part of his plea, agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department in its investigation. He faces 37 to 46 months behind bars, according to sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors alleged that Taherzadeh, Ali and a third, unnamed individual, duped federal agents, including members of the Secret Service, by ingratiating themselves with the agents by giving them gifts and rent-free apartments. One agent, who Taherzadeh offered to purchase an expensive rifle for, was on the first lady’s protective detail at the time, according to court documents.   The group never paid for the luxury apartments they rented in DC and were evicted from several buildings, racking up more than $800,000 in unpaid rent, fees and parking, according to prosecutors. Using fictitious individuals as their “supervisors,” Taherzadeh would tell the apartment buildings that the government would be paying their rent and blamed government bureaucracy and their fake bosses for unpaid bills, court documents say.  According to the plea agreement, which was read aloud during Monday’s hearing, Taherzadeh also worked to recruit other individuals to his fake Homeland Security Investigations force he said was under DHS.  Taherzadeh made up false acts of heroism as part of these efforts to recruit others and falsely claimed he had been an Army Ranger and an Air Marshal.  As part of the recruitment process, one individual was shot with an air rifle by Taherzadeh, who said on Monday that the two would shoot each other, adding that it was “something we did kind of as a drinking game.”  Taherzadeh also said that he set up a security camera in his bedroom and filmed women engaging in sexual activity without their consent, videos which he showed others. The men also used their fake personas to get access to security footage from the apartment they were living in, according to prosecutors. Taherzadeh also has agreed to testify in any trial or grand jury related to his crimes as part of the plea deal and will appear before the court in November for a status update on his cooperation.

14,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/kentucky-appalachia-flooding-monday/,"""articleBody"":""The death toll in flood-stricken Kentucky has risen to 37, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday afternoon, as rescue workers continue to comb the region for hundreds of missing people, unable to access areas left isolated after floodwater washed away bridges and inundated communities.  “We are ending the day with more heartbreaking news out of Eastern Kentucky. We can confirm the death toll has now risen to 37, with so many more still missing,” Beshear tweeted late Monday afternoon. “Let us pray for these families and come together to wrap our arms around our fellow Kentuckians.” The death toll could still rise further, according to officials, with “hundreds of unaccounted for people” at a minimum, the governor said at a news conference earlier in the day in Frankfort.  “We just don’t have a firm grasp on that. I wish we did – there are a lot of reasons why it’s nearly impossible,” he said. “But I want to make sure we’re not giving either false hope or faulty information.” The flooding last week swelled over roads, destroyed bridges and swept away entire homes, displacing thousands of Kentuckians, Beshear previously said. Vital electricity, water and roadway infrastructure was also knocked out. Some of it has yet to be restored, though cell service is returning in some of the state’s hardest-hit areas,  the governor said, which may help people connect with loved ones they’ve yet to contact. “I’ve lived here in this town for 56 years, and I have never seen water of this nature,” Tracy Neice, the mayor of Hindman, Kentucky, told CNN, saying his town’s main street looked like a stretch of river where one might go whitewater rafting. “It was just devastating to all of our businesses, all of our offices.” While reading a breakdown of those killed in each county during a news conference Sunday, Beshear became visibly emotional when he reached four children dead in Knott County. They were identified to CNN by their aunt as siblings Chance, 2; Nevaeh, 4; Riley Jr., 6; and Madison, 8. “It says ‘minors,’” the governor said looking at the list. “They are children. The oldest one is in second grade,” Beshear said.  The children – described as sweet, funny and lovable – died after the family’s mobile home flooded last week, forcing them to seek shelter on the roof, their aunt, Brandi Smith, told CNN on Friday.  “They were holding on to them,” Smith said of her sister and her partner. “The water got so strong it just washed them away.”  Sixteen of the deaths occurred in Knott County, about 130 miles southeast of Lexington, per the governor’s office. Seven people were killed in Breathitt County, two in Clay County, two in Letcher County and three in Perry County.   The governor believes recovery crews are “going to be finding bodies for weeks,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, “many of them swept hundreds of yards, maybe a quarter-mile plus from where they were last.” More rain in the forecast Officials are “still in search and rescue mode,” Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman told CNN on Monday, “because there is so much water.”  “All of our state roads are passable,” she said, but “we still have back roads and country roads that are broken off, and our bridges are out. So it’s really difficult to get to some of the most remote places.”  In Perry County, as many as 50 bridges are damaged and inaccessible, according to county Judge Executive Scott Alexander.   “What that means is there’s somebody living on the other side or multiple families living up our holler on the other side that we’re still not able to have road access to,” Alexander said. Things could get more difficult due to a slight risk of excessive rainfall throughout the region Monday, the National Weather Service said, and with the ground already saturated, more rain could bring yet more flooding.  “If things weren’t hard enough on the people in this region, they’re getting rain right now,” Beshear said Monday.  A flood watch will be in effect overnight, lasting from 9 p.m. Monday to 9 a.m. Tuesday. Forecasts predict thunderstorms and potential rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Heavy downpours could cause excessive runoff and “result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,” said the weather service. Temperatures are expected to rise later this week, hitting the mid-80s and near 90 on Wednesday and Thursday, per the weather service, but it will feel much hotter because of the humidity. The heat indices – the temperature it feels like when heat is combined with humidity – are expected to peak around 100 degrees in some places, leaving rescue crews and displaced people facing oppressive heat as more than 14,000 customers remain without power. As the climate crisis fuels more frequent extreme weather events, several areas of the US are currently experiencing flash flood risk, including swathes of the desert Southwest, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Tucson, Arizona.   Region in desperate need of resources Meantime, state officials are immediately focused on getting food, water and shelter to the people who were forced to flee their homes.  Power outages and storm damage left 22 water systems operating in a limited capacity, a Sunday news release from the governor’s office said. More than 60,000 water service connections are either without water or under a boil advisory, it said.  Officials overseeing the recovery efforts say bottled water, cleaning supplies and relief fund donations are among the most needed resources as the region works toward short- and long-term recovery. FEMA is providing tractor trailers full of water to several counties.  “A lot of these places have never flooded. So if they’ve never flooded, these people will not have flood insurance,” the mayor of Hazard, Kentucky, Donald Mobelini told CNN on Saturday. “If they lose their home, it’s total loss. There’s not going to be an insurance check coming to help that. We need cash donations,” he said, referring to a relief fund set up by the state. Among those without flood insurance is Jessica Willett, a mother who tied herself to her two children using a cord she cut off her vacuum.  “I thought I could try to save us,” she told CNN Monday. “Or, you know, if we didn’t make it, then we could be found all together.”  Willett had no warning when the flooding began, she said. She heard some noises and when she opened her door, the water was there. Eventually, the house was swept off its foundation, and washed about a hundred feet down the road, Willett estimated.  The family finally escaped around 3 or 4 a.m., when Willett left her children and ventured out to wade through the water running across the road to see how deep it was. Once she knew she could get through safely, she went back for them.  Asked what she’ll do next, Willett said, “I don’t know.” “We have insurance but we don’t have flood insurance,” she said, holding back tears. “Because we weren’t in a flood zone. So I don’t know what to do.” Beshear established a Team Eastern Kentucky Flood Relief Fund to pay the funeral expenses of flood victims and raise money for those impacted by the damage. As of Sunday morning, the fund had received more than $1 million in donations, according to the governor. The federal government has approved relief funding for several counties. FEMA is also accepting individual disaster assistance applications from impacted renters and homeowners in Breathitt, Clay, Knott, Letcher and Perry counties, the governor said. On Monday he requested a number of other impacted counties be made eligible.  Beshear believes the losses will be “in the tens if not the hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said over the weekend. The extensive loss Kentuckians are suffering will likely also take a mental toll, Frances Everage, a therapist and 44-year resident of the city of Hazard told CNN. While her home was spared, she said some of her friends have damaged homes or lost their entire farms.  “When you put your blood, sweat and tears into something and then see it ripped away in front of your eyes, there’s going to be a grieving process,” Everage said. “This community will rebuild and we will be okay, but the impact on mental health is going to be significant.” CNN’s Sara Smart, Andy Rose, Lauren Lee, Raja Razek, Mike Valerio, Mark Biello, Cole Higgins, Robert Shackelford, Chris Boyette, Aya Elamroussi, Dakine Andone, Caitlin Kaiser and Tom Sater contributed to this report.

156,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/tech/musk-twitter-subpoenas/,"""articleBody"":""Twitter has subpoenaed a number of Elon Musk’s associates, according to court filings and public statements, as the company moves forward with its legal fight against the Tesla billionaire over his attempt to terminate their $44 billion acquisition deal. The list of those who have received subpoenas includes several prominent investment firms and venture capitalists, some of whom are part of the so-called PayPal mafia, a group of influential figures in the tech industry who worked at the payment company cofounded by Musk. According to a court filing, Twitter sent a subpoena to Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based VC firm established by Peter Thiel, the controversial billionaire who was also a cofounder at PayPal. Twitter is also said to have sent subpoenas to investors Joe Lonsdale and David Sacks, according to tweets from both individuals.  Lonsdale, a cofounder of Palantir and former PayPal employee, claimed in a tweet this week that his subpoena is part of a “giant harassing fishing expedition.” Sacks, a former PayPal exec and founder of Yammer, responded to the subpoena by tweeting a magazine cover with an image of a middle finger on it. Twitter declined to comment for this story. Musk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement last month, alleging that Twitter breached the deal by failing to hand over data he says he needs to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform. Days later, Twitter sued Musk to force him to follow through with the deal. A five-day trial is set to begin in Delaware on October 17 after Twitter pushed for an expedited process. By sending out subpoenas to investors and associates of Musk, Twitter could be trying to determine when the Tesla CEO decided to back out of the deal and his motive in doing so. “They’re trying to verify his story,” Charles Elson, founding director of Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, told CNN Business. “Was he really misled? Was he not? Was this a strategy, or was this a genuine concern about what they had told him or didn’t tell him?” Some analysts have suggested that Musk is using the bot explanation as an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in Twitter shares and the overall tech market. Tesla shares, which Musk is relying on in part to finance the deal, also declined after he agreed to the acquisition. (A lawyer for Musk has previously called that suggestion “nonsense.”)  Prior to moving to terminate the deal, Musk had lined up financing for the acquisition, including debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions as well as billions in equity financing from various tech investment firms.  According to a court filing, Twitter sent a subpoena to AH Capital Investments, a fund from Andreessen Horowitz, which was among the firms listed as agreeing to provide equity financing for the deal. Founders Fund and AH Capital Investments were not available for immediate comment.  Twitter also sent subpoenas to two of Musk’s companies, Tesla and SpaceX, according to court filings.

Over 100 million Americans have been under heat alerts for eight of the last 16 days, according to NOAA’s heat.gov site and now the heat will build eastward through the end of the week. More than 80% of the US population will experience temperatures over 90 degrees within the next week, including the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Heat indexes, the apparent temperature of your skin when humidity is factored, will range from 95 to 100 degrees for NYC and up to 105 degrees for Washington, Baltimore and Boston. Adding to the misery, overnight lows will struggle to drop below 75-80 degrees, limiting the body’s ability to cool off at night. Boston mayor declares a heat emergency for the city Mayor Michelle Wu declared a heat emergency for Boston lasting from Thursday through Sunday ahead of a four-day stretch with sizzling temperatures in the Northeast heading into the weekend. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a heat advisory for Boston that will start Thursday at 11 a.m., according to a tweet Monday. The heat index in the Boston area is expected to cross into triple-digit temperatures Thursday and Friday, reaching as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit Thursday and 101 degrees Friday, according to the NWS. The heat index will dip back down into the 90s during the weekend with forecast highs of 94 and 99 degrees on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. “We’re working quickly to make sure all of our Boston residents and families are protected during this week’s extremely hot weather,” Wu said in a release Wednesday. “I urge everyone to stay cool and safe and check on your neighbors during the week.” The release states that 16 cooling centers will open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Sunday at Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF) locations, where mask-wearing is “strongly recommended” due to rising Covid-19 cases. Pools will also be available at some of the BCYF community centers, according to the release. Public library locations will also offer cool spaces in addition to splash pads, and outdoor water play areas, which will be available at Boston parks and playgrounds, the release states.

492,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/media/alex-jones-trial-reliable-sources/,"""articleBody"":""The Texas jury’s decision last week to have Alex Jones face punitive damages of more than $45 million in a lawsuit filed by the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victim Jesse Lewis was a “reckoning that was 10 years in the making,” CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said.  A pair of Chicago-based podcast hosts have spent the past 5 years holding Jones and his Infowars network accountable. Their program, Knowledge Fight, has produced more than 700 episodes, and uses comedy to “cut through crazy lies,” Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday.   Hosts Dan Friesen and Jordan Holmes traveled to Texas to witness Jones’ trial first hand.  Friesen said the most powerful moment inside the courtroom was watching Jesse Lewis’ mom Scarlett Lewis give her testimony and speak directly to Jones. “I think it will stay with pretty much everyone there for the rest of their lives,” Friesen said.  The co-hosts have been covering Jones since 2017, watching his transformation from a seemingly untouchable figure to one that is now in serious legal and financial jeopardy.  “During this whole stretch of time, his content itself has been essentially hollow,” Friesen said. “Watching him from my perspective has gotten a lot less interesting.” But despite Jones’ legal woes, Holmes said that the culture he’s helped engender has gotten a lot bigger. “Conspiracy culture is something that is created through the cracks of our regular society,” Holmes said.  And although their podcast focuses on scrutinizing Jones and his tactics, Holmes said the trial was really about the victims. “People would like to focus on Alex being kind of a bombastic character that we can mock and make fun of, but this isn’t about him,” Holmes said.  The podcast format allows the hosts to go beyond Jones as a character and dive into the mechanisms of what he’s doing and why these conspiracy narratives exist.  “We approach it with the understanding that it’s a serious topic,” Friesen said. “But also that in order to make it interesting for anybody to listen to, we have to make it make something entertaining.”  Friesen has listened to countless hours of Jones’ program, and calls it an “incredibly boring experience.” “The reason that I do this is because I can stomach that boredom,” Friesen said. He endures the task in order to help others get insights into the misinformation phenomenon. “So they could be in a place where they could better understand what Alex is doing and what he brings to the table.”  Many hope that the legal and financial jeopardy Jones’ is now facing will help curtail misinformation and conspiracy culture. But Friesen isn’t convinced it will be a severe blow.  “The conspiracy producers and people who engage in the sorts of conduct that Alex does end up becoming a little bit savvier,” Friesen said. “They end up learning where the lines are … of what they can do and what they can get away with.”  "",",Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Jesse Lewi;Brian Stelter;Scarlett Lewis;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Jesse Lewis;Dan Friesen,Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,244;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1891;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1891;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1891;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1891;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,250;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,250;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,250;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,86;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,655;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,812;TAX_FNCACT_CORRESPONDENT,264;TRIAL,27;TRIAL,567;TRIAL,724;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,179;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,717;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,874;TRANSPARENCY,409;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1119;",Sandy Hook;New York;Chicago;Texas
379,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/lawrence-rudolph-guilty-safari-murder-cec/,"""articleBody"":""An American dentist and big-game hunter was found guilty of murder in the shooting death of his wife on an African safari. Lawrence Rudolph, 67, killed his wife, Bianca Rudolph, with a shotgun and defrauded multiple  insurance companies, a federal jury found Monday. Rudolph cashed in more than $4.8 million in life insurance payments after her death almost six years ago. Rudolph has maintained his innocence and said he believes the gun fired accidentally. “I did not kill my wife. I could not murder my wife. I would not murder my wife,” Rudolph told jurors when he took the stand in his own defense at a federal trial in Denver last week.  The Phoenix couple shared a passion for big-game hunting, and had traveled to the southern African nation of Zambia in September 2016 so Bianca Rudolph could add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. Two weeks later, as Bianca Rudolph was packing for the couple’s return home, she suffered a fatal blast from the Browning shotgun in their hunting cabin at Kafue National Park. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot at dawn while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents said. He told investigators he found her bleeding on the floor.   But federal prosecutors at Rudolph’s trial in Denver, where the insurance companies are based, described it as a premeditated crime. Prosecutors argued Rudolph killed his wife of 30 years for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend, Lori Milliron. Defense attorney David Markus had argued that Larry Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In court documents, he noted that Rudolph owns a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million.  “We are obviously extremely disappointed. We believe in Larry and his children,” Markus and fellow defense attorneys Margot Moss and Lauren Doyle told CNN in a statement after Monday’s verdict. “There are lots of really strong appellate issues, which we will be pursuing after we have had a chance to regroup.” The jury also found Milliron, Rudolph’s girlfriend, guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder, obstruction of justice and two counts of perjury based on her testimony before a grand jury, according to the Department of Justice.  Milliron, who was tried alongside Rudolph, said the couple had been in an open relationship, according to court documents. Milliron and Rudolph lived together from 2017 until his arrest last year, her attorney, John Dill, told CNN. “We are disappointed in the jury’s verdict, but that is our system,” Dill said. “Lori Milliron is innocent and we will continue to fight to exonerate her.”  An embassy official expressed suspicion after the shooting, the FBI said  In court documents, investigators alleged Rudolph raised suspicions when he sought to quickly cremate his wife’s body in Zambia. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge.  Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. But forensic evidence showed Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint said. US Attorney Cole Finegan welcomed the jury’s ruling. “Bianca Rudolph deserved justice,” Finegan said in a statement. “We can only hope this verdict brings Bianca’s family some amount of peace.”   A friend of Bianca Rudolph’s asked the FBI to investigate  But federal investigators maintained the shooting was premeditated so that Rudolph “could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleged.   Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of Bianca Rudolph asked the FBI to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Larry Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death.  Milliron worked as a manager at Larry Rudolph’s dental practice near Pittsburgh and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, according to court documents. Milliron moved in with Rudolph three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, court documents said.

187,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/carolyn-maloney-biden-reelection/,"""articleBody"":""Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said Tuesday evening she doesn’t believe President Joe Biden will run for reelection in 2024, the latest Democrat to publicly cast doubt on a second Biden term. “I don’t believe he’s running for reelection,” Maloney said when asked if the President should run again during a congressional primary debate in New York’s 12th district.  Responding to the same question, Rep. Jerry Nadler, who is running against Maloney following redistricting, said it’s “too early to say” and that it “doesn’t serve the purpose of the Democratic Party” to deal with the question until after midterms. Maloney’s other opponent, Suraj Patel, simply answered, “Yes.”  Democrats have privately shared concerns about Biden, who is 79 and struggling with poor approval ratings, running for a second term in the 2024 election. The President and his aides have pushed back on any idea that he won’t run for a second term, and most Democrats have publicly said they will support Biden if he runs for a second term. Maloney told CNN on Wednesday that if Biden runs for reelection, she will back him. “If he decides to run, I’m supporting him. I’m supporting him and I don’t have other comment,” Maloney said over the phone. “I think that he’s done a terrific job and most recently the inflation reduction plan. There are so many good things in it for the economy and for people. And I’m supporting him if he runs. OK?” Pressed again on why she had said she didn’t believe Biden would run for reelection, Maloney reiterated: “I’m supporting him, if he runs. OK?” A CNN poll out last month found 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than Biden in the 2024 election, a sharp increase from earlier this year. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota went further than Maloney in an interview last week, stating he doesn’t want Biden to run for president in 2024. “I have respect for Joe Biden. I think he has – despite some mistakes and some missteps, despite his age, I think he’s a man of decency, of good principle, of compassion, of empathy, and of strength. But to answer your question directly, which I know is quite rare, uh no, I don’t,” Phillips said an interview on the Chad Hartman radio show on WCCO-AM. “I think the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up,” Phillips added.  This story has been updated with additional comments from Maloney. CNN’s MJ Lee and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.

216,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/europe/prince-charles-donation-money-bin-laden-intl/,"""articleBody"":""Clarence House, the residence of Prince Charles, has disputed claims reported in the UK’s Sunday Times that the heir to the throne brokered a deal in 2013 to accept a £1 million charity donation from Osama bin Laden’s half-brothers. The Sunday Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that Prince Charles accepted the donation from Bakr bin Laden and Shafiq bin Laden for The Prince of Wales’ Charitable Fund (PWCF) despite objections from key advisers at the time.  Clarence House disputed that assertion on Saturday, saying the decision to accept the money was made by the charity’s Trustees, and not Prince Charles. “The Prince of Wales’ Charitable Fund has assured us that thorough due diligence was undertaken in accepting this donation,” the Clarence House statement said. “The decision to accept was taken by the charity’s Trustees alone and any attempt to characterize it otherwise is false.”  Bakr bin Laden is the former chairman of the Jeddah-based construction company Saudi Binladin Group. Osama bin Laden was removed as a shareholder from the family company in 1993, when Bakr bin Laden was chairman, US court documents show.  Osama Bin Laden was the leader of al Qaeda when the network carried out the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001. He was killed by US special forces in an operation 10 years later. Neither Bakr or Shafiq bin Laden have any known ties to terrorist activities or appear on any counter-terror sanctions lists issued by the United Nations or the governments of the US, EU and the UK. According to the Sunday Times report, Prince Charles secured the funds after a meeting with Bakr bin Laden, and accepted the donation, despite the “initial objection of advisers at Clarence House” and the PWCF.   PWCF also responded to the Sunday Times’ report saying that “the donation from Sheik Bakr Bin Laden was carefully considered by PWCF Trustees. Due diligence was conducted, with information sought from a wide range of sources, including government.” A royal source told CNN that they disputed The Sunday Times’ claims that Prince Charles personally accepted the donation, that he brokered the deal and that advisors around Prince Charles pleaded for him to return the money at the time. A source close to PWCF said that “after a thorough examination of the issues, the Trustees concluded that the actions of one Bin Laden family member should not tarnish the whole family.” The Sunday Times reported in June that Prince Charles had accepted charitable donations in the form of cash from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar, between 2011 and 2015. Clarence House also disputed the details of the June report and said that the “correct processes” were followed in terms of accepting the donation."",",,Saudi Binladin Group;Prince Of Wale Charitable Fund;Prince Of Wale Charitable Fund;United Nations;Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1982;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1982;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,938;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1123;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,459;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,1704;LEADER,2589;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,2589;TERROR,1383;ARMEDCONFLICT,1383;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,1195;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,1183;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,984;KILL,1270;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1270;SANCTIONS,1434;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,41;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,309;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,393;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,615;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,637;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,1572;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,2062;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,2161;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,2451;MILITARY,1291;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,2589;",United Kingdom;Jeddah;New York;Qatar
52,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/americas/mexico-miners-sabinas-intl-latam/,"""articleBody"":""Ten miners have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for over 24 hours, as rescuers battle to reach them. The incident was reported Wednesday afternoon, when the miners encountered an abandoned tunnel with water that flooded the mine, authorities said. Rescuers managed to extract five people from the mine on Wednesday, and are now working to pump water out of the flooded area, according to National Coordinator of Civil Protection, Laura Velazquez, who is overseeing the rescue operation. “We have not slept, we are working day and night, uninterrupted,” said Velazquez on Thursday. “We are strategically putting pumps in each of these wells to be able to extract the greatest amount of water and have immediate access to the mines and rescue the miners as soon as possible,” she said. Early on Thursday morning, six special forces divers joined the rescue operations, General Agustin Radilla said. There has been no update on their findings as of yet, however. “They say the water is rising…I want my husband to come out all right,” said the wife of one trapped miner, Erika Escobedo, to Reuters. She told the news agency that she had spent “all night watching rescue efforts at the site.” Governor Miguel Riquelme, of Coahuila and Zaragoza state, traveled on Thursday to the municipality of Sabinas where the mine is located. “Five water extraction pumps totaling 150 horsepower are currently working and other submersible pumps are being installed, which are being sent by companies in the region and thus continue with the rescue efforts,” he wrote on Twitter.  Sabinas is no stranger to mining tragedies. In 2006, an explosion in a local mine killed 65 people. In 2011, 14 miners were trapped and confirmed dead following another mine blast in Sabinas.   According a statement released by Mexico’s Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare, the mine where the ten are currently trapped only began operations in January, and “does not have a history of complaints for any type of anomaly.” In his daily press briefing on Thursday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said any investigation into the mine would come only after the rescue operation had concluded. “Those responsible, the permits, the inspections, everything, all of that, we are leaving until after. We already have the basic information,” he said.  “But let’s not talk about that now, let’s look to save the miners.” Reporting contributed by Daniela Gonzalez-Roman in New York City and Karol Suarez in Mexico City.

337,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/texas-uvalde-shooting-dps-arrival/,"""articleBody"":""Body camera footage released by the city of Uvalde last month shows a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper was on the scene outside Robb Elementary School just 2 minutes and 28 seconds after the gunman entered, a timeline earlier than previously known. The department had only disclosed, in timelines and testimony, that the first state trooper entered the school hallway at 11:42 a.m., nine minutes after the gunman entered the school. But DPS had not stated when the trooper first arrived at the school itself. The more specific timeline raises further questions about DPS’s own transparency and role in the botched police response, even as the department leads the investigation into what happened. The body camera video was provided to CNN by Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, who has expressed his frustration with the department’s investigation and accused DPS of a “cover-up.” The head of the largest police union in Texas said the new timeline raised serious questions about the department’s trustworthiness. “I don’t know that we can trust them to do an internal investigation,” Charley Wilkison, the executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which represents some law enforcement officers in Uvalde, told CNN on Tuesday. “It would be best if the investigation were headed up by an outside independent source that the public can have total confidence in. “I would say that DPS was fast to wash its hands, to point fingers and to make sure that the general public, particularly the elected officials, knew that they were spotless, blameless and that this was a local problem,” he added. The new reporting comes more than two months after an 18-year-old gunman entered the school, opened fire inside two adjoining classrooms and slaughtered 19 children and two teachers. Officers arrived on the scene minutes later, but after taking fire from the gunman, they retreated to a hallway, and the gunman remained inside the classrooms for a total of 77 minutes before a tactical unit forced their way in and killed him, according to a timeline from the public safety department. The long delay contradicts a widely taught protocol for active shooter situations, which says that law enforcement should stop the gunman as fast as possible. Yet authorities have repeatedly offered conflicting timelines and muddled explanations as to what happened in that period. In June, DPS Director Col. Steven McCraw called the law enforcement response an “abject failure” in testimony before the Texas Senate. He placed sole blame for the delayed response on the on-scene commander, Uvalde School Police Chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo. “The only thing stopping the hallway of dedicated officers from entering rooms 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander, who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children.” Arredondo has said he did not consider himself to be in command that day, but body camera videos and other documents undermine that claim and show him giving orders and conveying and receiving information. The school district’s superintendent placed him on administrative leave in late June. What the body camera video shows The body camera video shows the hectic scene in the moments after the shooting as law enforcement raced to the school. The gunman entered the school at 11:33:00 a.m., according to the official Texas DPS timeline. In the body camera video, the Texas state trooper is seen running on the street leading to one of the entrances of the school at 11:35:28. While the image of the trooper is difficult to make out in the distance, closer images of the trooper can be seen in the minutes that follow as the trooper gets closer to the police officer wearing the body camera. At 11:36:01 the trooper is seen taking cover behind a vehicle and a second later the trooper is seen running toward one of the entrances of the school. At 11:40:32, the body camera video shows that the state trooper was at the east entrance of the building. Just over a minute later, the trooper is seen on body camera video inside the building at 11:41:44. The official timeline released by DPS noted that a Texas DPS trooper entered the east hallway at 11:42:24, but did not mention when the trooper first arrived outside the school. In his testimony to the Texas Senate, McCraw also revealed that a trooper was in the hallway at 11:42 but did not mention when the trooper arrived on scene. According to DPS, McCraw’s testimony only included the troopers who entered the building, with arrival times expected to be included in a detailed final report. “The timeline from the Director’s testimony was limited to officers entering the West building and that information was based on enhanced interior school surveillance footage and limited body camera coverage,” Texas DPS spokesperson Ericka Miller said in a statement. Miller added that the investigation is ongoing and investigators are working to synchronize body camera footage with the timeline of events.  Miller also said that state trooper Sgt. Juan Maldonado was among the first officers to arrive on the scene, accompanied by Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Officer Ruben Ruiz.

295,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/private-astronaut-mission-new-requirements/,"""articleBody"":""Private astronaut missions to the International Space Station will have to be chaperoned by a former NASA astronaut, per new proposed requirements from the US space agency.  NASA posted a public notice online on Tuesday that laid out a handful of updated requirements for future private astronaut missions, which the agency said are based on lessons learned upon completion of the first private astronaut mission to the ISS that took place last April. The first all-private mission to the orbiting laboratory was a multi-million dollar journey organized by Texas-based startup Axiom Space and launched via a SpaceX rocket, with a crew comprised of a former NASA astronaut and current Axiom Space employee, Michael López-Alegría, and three ultra-wealthy paying crewmembers. During the mission, dubbed AX-1, the four-member crew spent nearly two weeks off of Earth’s surface, at least in part conducting experiments and other scientific work. Other space tourism companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic only offer customers short trips that allow for a few minutes of microgravity. Among the most notable new policies for these pricey, private missions to the ISS is that “upcoming private astronaut missions include a former flown NASA (U.S.) government astronaut as the mission commander,” according to the NASA update.  The requirement is still being finalized, NASA added, but the agency noted that having a former, legitimate astronaut “provides experienced guidance for the private astronauts during pre-flight preparation through mission execution.” The former NASA astronaut also “provides a link” between residents on the ISS and the private astronauts, which the agency said “reduces risk” to ISS operations and safety.  Late last year, SpaceX launched the Inspiration4 mission, which was bankrolled by billionaire Jared Isaacman and had a four-person crew composed entirely of people without any prior spaceflight experience. This private mission, however, simply took a three-day spin around Earth in a SpaceX dragon capsule and did not dock at the ISS.  Axiom has already stated that its second private astronaut mission to the ISS, dubbed AX-2 and expected to launch next year, will have former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson as a mission commander. During remarks at the annual International Space Station Research and Development Conference last week, López-Alegría spoke about how he became mission commander for the AX-1 flight, saying he initially didn’t expect to return to space after retiring from NASA.  When Axiom was looking for customers, however, “It became pretty clear, first of all, that customers really didn’t want to fly with nobody who’d done it before,” he said. It also became apparent, he said, “NASA was a lot more comfortable having someone who’d been there before.”  “We were having a meeting and we looked around the room and I was the only guy who’d been to space, so I raised my hand. I volunteered,” López-Alegría quipped at the conference.  NASA is also adding additional requirements that appear to be a result of new information learned from the AX-1 mission. Future private missions to the space station will include more time for “microgravity adaptation,” as the floating environment of the ISS can often induce space sickness, which is akin to motion sickness.  The federal space agency will also be introducing clarifications to the ISS code of conduct for commercial visitors, requirements for more detailed plans regarding crew interactions with the media, as well as a requirement for additional time to evaluate research proposals before they are brought on board. Larry Connor, an AX-1 crewmember, told CNN in April that he and his crewmates were pressed for research time on the ISS. “If it were not for the NASA’s Crew-3 astronauts, and their phenomenal help, we would never - underscore the word never - have been able to accomplish all of our objectives,” Connor said at the time. “We underestimated the time on some of the projects. We had one project early on that we thought was two-and-a-half hours take five hours.” A NASA rep did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for further comment on the new requirements. They come, however, as the private spaceflight industry has officially lifted off after decades of people largely having to rely on government agencies and the extraordinarily selective astronaut hiring process if they wanted to go to space. Now, those who seek to leave Earth’s surface simply must have the means to pay for it.  While Axiom did not publicly disclose how much its first cohort of private astronauts shelled out for the AX-1 mission, the Washington Post reported that each crew member dished out $55 million for the flight.

461,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/kentucky-flooding-survivor-stories/,"""articleBody"":""With another flood watch in place in eastern Kentucky, people here are hoping and praying for one more miracle.  Some saw it as a miracle they survived the historic flooding more than a week ago. They might feel it could take another to survive the aftermath – the mud and debris of destroyed houses and businesses, the pain of dozens of lives lost and many missing, and the trauma of their experiences. Over the past week, across the now-declared disaster area, survivors have shared harrowing stories with CNN of barely escaping the rushing waters, incredible rescue missions, and desperate attempts to save their families and themselves.   But they also have stories of barely surviving the cruel wake once the water receded – being stranded by washed out roads and bridges, struggling to get food, medicine or water in the early days, being rescued by neighbors.  “We’re not victims here,” said Allen Bormes, police chief for the city of Fleming-Neon, where there’s little left besides debris and mud. “We’re survivors.” More than a week after the flooding, Fleming-Neon Mayor Susan Polis still cries when recalling the devastation she saw in its aftermath. “Well, I wasn’t prepared. But what can you do when your little town is, your little city is devastated? I mean, it was like a war zone,” she said. City Hall is destroyed, leaving officials this week to work out of a camper and a tent over a table set up in a parking lot. The water lines on buildings lining Main Street reach well over 6 feet.  The water and debris broke windows all along the main part of downtown, in shops, the town dental office, churches – nothing was spared. Like many other communities in the region, there isn’t any clean, running water.   “Our vision is to build this back better than it was before, before the rain,” said Bormes. With a catch in his throat, he took a moment to collect his emotions before continuing. “Because these people deserve it. They deserve to have what they had before and more.” Fleming-Neon was nearly impossible to reach in the first days after the flood, so help came from within the community. Polis recalled people being trapped in a holler until neighbors acted.  “They had a bridge to basically disintegrate. And for that night, for the rest of Thursday night and into Friday afternoon, there was no way in and no way out, for those people,” Polis said, “So, some citizens, before all this heavy equipment started coming in – the citizens, they fixed it.” Quick thinking in a close call with death Letcher Fire Chief Wallace Bolling Jr. still can’t believe he lived to tell how he survived the floods. Bolling, who people around town call Spanky, received a call that the fire station in nearby Jeremiah was flooding. He drove his pickup to the station, in part to move vehicles to avoid damage. In hindsight, he admitted the decision wasn’t good.   The water started to rise quickly as he pulled up to the station, trapping him inside his truck, which he said began floating with the current. His only option was to try to steer the truck into an old tanker he had left parked outside the station, he said.  Unable to open the truck’s door or window, “I reached and found my pistol in the back seat, and I shot the window out of my Chevy,” he said. Diving out the window, he made it to safety by climbing on top of the tanker, where he remained for 15 hours as flood waters, downed trees and debris rushed past him. “I had a lot of time to think about a lot of things,” Bolling said. “I found peace. I wasn’t scared. I had a long talk with the Lord.”  While stranded, Bolling texted his mother and father: “I love you, please don’t worry… everything is fine… I love you.” Dealing with post-traumatic stress The Letcher Fire Department was destroyed, with all vehicles damaged. Insurance won’t be enough to cover all the damages, according to Bolling. While Bolling plans to get the station straightened out, he also has to address his own trauma, he said. He hasn’t been able to sleep and often hears water when he closes his eyes. “I’m having a lot of trouble. I’m not going to lie,” he said. He plans to talk to a therapist and hopes others who survived the storm can do the same. “PTSD is real, and I kind of wondered about things, like how to go forward, but you know, I gotta fix myself first,” he said.   But along with the sorrow, there’s pride, too, in the way their Appalachian community has come together, with neighbors who lost everything helping neighbors in the same situation.  Volunteers from all over Appalachia have been sweeping and using small bulldozers to get mud out of buildings this week.  And while proud of their independent and resilient community, officials in Fleming-Neon admit the city is desperate for all the help it can get.  “Our infrastructure needs help from Washington, from Frankfort. We’re going to have to have a lot of help,” Fire Chief Bolling said. Gary Clink, who has lived just outside of Hindman for decades, was rescued, along with his wife and a neighbor, by his son-in-law, he said. Now he’s trying to save his wet furniture from mildew in the muddy interior of his home, which had more than 4 feet of water in it during the flood.  “It’s like someone turned the switch to maximum overdrive,” explained Clink as he sat on the porch looking at what was left of his belongings drying out on the lawn, “I’ve never seen water like that. It’s like a dam burst or a tsunami. “That’s the reason you see garbage wherever you look, houses wrecked. I’ve seen three homes I knew basically lifted up off the foundation base, as they washed down the stream and it ripped them apart.” And he worries that this catastrophe won’t be the last.  “I believe you’re seeing the effects of climate change right here,” Clink said. “Just given time, if we don’t turn it around, just given time, it’s going to get worse.”  Some are also concerned that people will leave the area because the devastation is too extreme. “This is literally the end of this little community,” Clink sighed, “These people, you’ll see a lot of them had decent appliances, decent furniture, decent clothes, but it is no longer decent. “If they didn’t have flood insurance or FEMA can’t step in and actually help… this is the end of the line for this community. I don’t see any way they are going to come back from it.” Bolling agreed. “It’s country back here. It’s slow. I mean, we love it. We stay back here,” Bolling said. “But at the same time, it’s never going to be the same. There will be a lot of people leave here. I know that. They have nothing to come back to.  But we’ll make it. We’re strong.”"",",Wallace Bolling Jr;Allen Bormes,Letcher Fire Department;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"ARMEDCONFLICT,1320;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1320;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD_WATERS,3622;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,293;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1188;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE_CHIEF,945;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,2549;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,2614;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1487;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5102;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_FIRE_STATION,2866;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODED,4640;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODED,4766;CRISISLEX_T05_MONEY,6725;TAX_FNCACT_FIRE_CHIEF,2695;TAX_FNCACT_FIRE_CHIEF,5392;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,330;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,6041;URBAN,1598;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,3882;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,5785;WB_2943_SWITCHES,5785;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,5785;WB_672_NETWORK_MANAGEMENT,5785;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5785;DISASTER_FIRE,2858;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,404;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,4199;SECURITY_SERVICES,939;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,939;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,939;TAX_FNCACT_VOLUNTEERS,5008;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3637;TAX_WEAPONS_PISTOL,3436;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2778;TAX_FNCACT_THERAPIST,4376;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,216;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,1087;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,1818;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,1887;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2898;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,216;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,1087;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,1818;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,1887;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2898;EDUCATION,4621;EDUCATION,4747;WB_1973_FINANCIAL_RISK_REDUCTION,4037;WB_1973_FINANCIAL_RISK_REDUCTION,6725;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,4037;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,6725;WB_337_INSURANCE,4037;WB_337_INSURANCE,6725;WB_1967_AGRICULTURAL_RISK_AND_SECURITY,4037;WB_1967_AGRICULTURAL_RISK_AND_SECURITY,6725;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,764;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,3812;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,1730;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,1730;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1730;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1730;WB_137_WATER,575;WB_137_WATER,3622;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,6284;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,6284;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,6284;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,498;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1037;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCHES,1645;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,945;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,2695;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,5392;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,133;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,905;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,3330;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,3365;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,905;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,3330;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,3365;MARITIME_INCIDENT,2360;MARITIME,2360;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,63;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,1755;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,1824;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,2227;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3322;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3357;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3615;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,5688;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,6715;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,69;NATURAL_DISASTER_DAM_BURST,5967;AFFECT,389;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,4575;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,4701;LEADER,1108;TAX_FNCACT_MAYOR,1108;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1382;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,5184;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,4594;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,4720;",Letcher County;Washington;Kentucky
455,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/secret-service-personal-cell-phones-oversight/,"""articleBody"":""Personal cell phone numbers of US Secret Service agents have been provided to oversight bodies looking into the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi would not confirm which oversight entities, but stressed USSS is in full cooperation as multiple inquiries are ongoing. The agency was thrust into the center stage of the House select committee’s investigation into January 6 following former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony in June during a public hearing. Hutchinson claimed then-President Donald Trump attempted to force the Secret Service to take him to the Capitol as Congress worked to certify the 2020 election results. Multiple sources told CNN it is an unusual step to provide personal cell phone numbers of Secret Service agents to investigators. CNN previously reported that the US Secret Service erased text messages from January 5 and 6, 2021. The text messages at issue may have been deleted when the agency conducted a data migration of phones that began January 27, 2021. Multiple oversight bodies, including the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the National Archives and the House January committee, are either investigating or requesting more information about the USSS text messages. It’s not immediately clear whether these personal cell phone numbers from agents are related to those inquiries. CNN recently reported the current USSS director, James Murray, is delaying his retirement, stressing the agency’s commitment to the investigations, such as the January 6 investigation. “I feel strongly about using this time to oversee and ensure our agency’s continued cooperation, responsiveness, and full support with respect to ongoing Congressional and other inquiries,” he said in a message to his workforce.

689,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/how-to-stay-cool-while-sleeping,"""articleBody"":""Some people run hot all the time, some wake up hot, some find themselves sweaty in the middle of the night and some experience all of the above. It’s not always the greatest feeling, and it can be a sign of something serious, but many times it can be related to hormonal changes, menopause, premenopause or just an overheated environment. Feeling hot can also simply make it harder to sleep, and according to research, the ideal temperature for sleep is actually a chilly 65 degrees Fahrenheit. There’s good news, though! An overheated environment can be fixed with just a few tweaks to your sleeping situation, like cooling bedding and gels or lightweight toppers for when it’s ridiculously hot out. Ahead, we highlight some products that, according to reviewers, make sleeping cool as easy as ever, as well as picks that we’ve personally tried and loved. Best sheets for hot sleepers California Design Den 400-Thread-Count 100% Cotton Sheets Set From $30.38 at Amazon “When shopping for cooling sheets, breathable fabrics made of natural materials do a great job of creating a cooler sleeping environment,” says Liz Boscacci, Casper’s director of product development. “Cotton percale and Tencel are two examples of such materials.” With more than 31,000 reviews, this 100% cotton sheet set is an Amazon favorite. The set comes with a flat sheet, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, and you can take your pick of anything from pastel solids to paisley and polka dots. “I made my bed and being that it was a warm night it provided the opportunity to test them to see if I would feel too warm,” one reviewer writes. “It was a cool comfortable experience and had a perfect sleep in my new sheets!” See more of our cooling sheets picks here. Comfort Spaces Coolmax Cooling Sheets From $20.35 at Amazon “In terms of bedding and fabrics — look for moisture-wicking textiles. These materials are designed to draw water away from the skin, helping your body to regulate its own temperature,” says nurse Angela Ballard. For cooling sheets that aren’t going to set you back too far, look no further than this set. Made of ultra-fine microfiber with moisture-absorbing technology that actually pulls moisture away from the skin, you only need to look at a few reviews to be convinced of their magic. For example: “I live in Arizona, so cool sheets feel like a necessity to me,” one reviewer writes. “I was on the brink of ordering a very expensive set of bamboo sheets from a specialty site when I saw the reviews for this set on Amazon. I’m so happy to report that these sheets are exactly what they purport to be. They are EXTREMELY comfortable and soft. They are also very cool. My husband doesn’t believe in ‘cool’ sheets because he sleeps very hot — he wakes up sweaty more often that not, usually — but he exclaimed last night that these sheets are very cool.” Parachute Linen Sheet Set From $189 at Parachute The winner of the best linen sheets of 2022, this Parachute set is made from 100% European flax in a family-owned factory in Portugal. Light and airy with the ability to get even softer after every wash, the colors couldn’t be dreamier too. “On the summer night we first tested these, the sheets were soft but also firm,” our reviewer wrote. “If this sounds uncomfortable, it was the converse: cool, light and luxurious. Our first mental note was that we felt like we were sleeping on a cloud.” My Sheets Rock The Regulator From $149 at My Sheets Rock “Bamboo rayon has many benefits for hot sleepers, as bamboo fabric wicks moisture, reduces humidity and stretches, all while staying extremely soft,” says Christopher Sun, founder of My Sheets Rock. Made with said bamboo rayon, these are designed to wick away moisture and even minimize smell. We’ve tried them ourselves and love how silky they look too. Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set $319 From $255.20 at Cozy Earth Another bamboo option, these sheets (which Oprah is a fan of), have made several Underscored editors fall head over heels. Made specifically with viscose from bamboo, these sheets are cool to the touch and even moisture-wicking. Luckily, the brand just branched out to supply more colors other than white too, so we’ll definitely be buying another set. Buffy Eucalyptus Sheet Set $149 From $126.65 at Buffy These sheets are made from 100% eucalyptus fiber, giving them a bit of a sheen and a cool-to-the-touch effect that’s simply irresistible for hot sleepers. An Underscored-editor favorite, one staffer who’s a particularly hot sleeper says that since she first tried these sheets three years ago, she hasn’t slept on another set since. Best pillows for hot sleepers Weekender Ventilated Gel Memory Foam Pillow From $34.99 at Amazon Cooling pillows for hot sleepers come in a variety of materials like shredded foam, gels and cotton. Look for one that holds in coolness and wicks away moisture. This well-priced, high-rated foam pillow is infused with a temperature-regulating gel for a cool night’s sleep. “I too had bought every pillow on the market over the years and this one is certainly the most comfortable, most cooling and best support yet,” writes one reviewer. “This is what a pillow should do! Cradle and support your head. My first thought was it wasn’t high enough and wouldn’t feel comfortable. Boy was I wrong. The second my head hit this pillow, I realized what I have been missing all along.” See more of our favorite pillows here. Snuggle-Pedic Original Memory Foam Pillow $54.99 From $44.99 at Amazon The bamboo cover and shredded memory foam make this pillow super breathable, with one happy reviewer writing, “I normally toss and turn all night. I don’t think I’ve moved much since I started using the pillow; it’s absolutely wonderful.” Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow $189 From $139 at Amazon or $199 at Tempur-Pedic From the experts at Tempur-Pedic comes this cooling pillow with gel on both sides to keep you cool all night long. “I’ve purchased close to 20 pillows over the past three years, trying to find one that stays cool while also being comfortable to sleep on. I’ve tried all types (memory foam, feather, real goose down, etc.),” writes one reviewer. “I’ve had this one for three months and have never had a better one. By far the coolest pillow I’ve used, and I don’t think I’ve ever had to flip it over. I’m a back/side sleeper, and the comfort also exceeds nearly every other pillow I’ve purchased. Best sleep I’ve had in years.” Casper Foam Pillow $89 From $66.75 at Casper With cooling foam and a three-layer design meant to make it extra huggable (and who doesn’t want that?), this is one of our favorite pillows to sleep on night after night. You can use the code CNNSLEEP10 for 10% off your entire order. Best blankets for hot sleepers Bearaby Tree Napper From $269 at Bearaby Weighted blankets can be extremely hot under, so when we find one that doesn’t make us sweat, we are elated. Enter: the Bearaby Tree Napper. As one editor observed: “The Tree Napper is especially cooling, as it’s made from moisture-wicking Tencel that uses eucalyptus fiber, a material that’s naturally even cooler than linen, not to mention super soft. In fact, it’s so cool to the touch that sometimes I find myself layering it with another blanket because I’m too chilly — not a sensation I’m used to in July! It’s the ideal summer option for weighted blanket aficionados who appreciate a chunky knit.” See more of our editor-favorite cooling blankets here. Brooklinen Linen Quilt From $279 at Brooklinen If a comforter is always too much for you, look no further than this linen quilt, which thrilled one Underscored editor. As she wrote: “Every night this summer I’ve slept on cooling sheets and a cooling mattress cover and used a cooling pillow. So really the final step in my cool-as-possible sleep setup was a cooling quilt, and this one I can say is just magic. Apart from being impossibly light and easy to bundle yourself in during even the muggiest of nights, it looks fantastic against any sheet color I’ve paired it with. I love the diamond stitching and can even see using it year-round under my heavier comforter.” Tranquility Cool-to-the-Touch Weighted Blanket $78.95 From $60 at Walmart We’ve tried this weighted blanket for several months now and we absolutely adore it. Cool on one side and plush on the other, it’s available in both 15- and 20-pound versions. As one editor wrote: “I made it so the cooler material was against my skin and soundly slept for a solid 10 hours. I never once kicked it off me in the middle of the night.” Bedsure Cooling Blanket From $32.99 at Amazon Looking for a good throw blanket that won’t make you sweat? Check out this one. As one editor wrote: “It’s thin enough that it can roll up really, really small, so it’s great for smaller apartments and storage as well. After hanging out with this blanket on the couch for a few days, I realized that it was a lovely barrier between my hot laptop and my legs, and I never felt the need to kick my legs out from underneath it like I usually have to do with blankets.” Cooling accessories Lasko Portable Electric 42-Inch Oscillating Tower Fan From $74.99 at Amazon With more than 23,000 reviews on Amazon, shoppers love this machine for how quietly it runs and, at the price, just how powerful its cooling powers are. Need more convincing? Just read this review: “One evening I needed a little help with cooling off,” one reviewer writes. “Within five minutes of turning this thing on, it was like an angel had come down from heaven to personally blow cool air on my face. I was genuinely close to tears. If this thing only lasts a month it will have been worth the money.” Need we say more? Honeywell QuietSet 5-Speed Oscillating Tower Fan $49.99 at Target Cooling fans allow a gentle breeze to calm your temp down while you drift to sleep. With more than 500 reviews, this fan is a Target shopper fave, with one writing, “I use it in all the bedrooms and family room, and it seems to circulate the air across most of the room.” Vornado VFan Mini Personal Vintage Air Circulator $39.99 at Amazon Personal fan more your jam? This vintage-looking cutie that reviewers love will sit on your nightstand and keep you cool while you snooze. Best mattresses for hot sleepers Nest Cooling Topper From $219 at Nest Not a mattress itself, but we wanted to start this section with a product that one editor thinks can actually make any mattress a cooling mattress. (Plus, mattresses are expensive, you know?) Made with cool-to-the-touch foam that you sink right into, she says this has “completely changed the way I sleep.” Purple Hybrid Mattress From $1,899 at Purple A unique mix of a gel grid, supportive coils and foam make this one of the coolest mattresses on the market. According to the brand, the pocketed coils allow for greater airflow compared to many other gel and entirely foam beds. “This mattress is fantastic,” writes one reviewer. “It took a couple nights to get used to it, but I sleep more soundly now than I ever did before and much cooler! The grid is what feels so different. It truly is amazing how much spring the mattress has, but when you move it doesn’t affect your partner.” Classic Brands Cool Gel Chill Memory Foam 14-Inch Mattress From $349.99 at Amazon This memory foam mattress is available in three different cooling options — cool gel chill, cool gel cloud and cool gel ice — each with its own benefits so you can really get the mattress of your dreams. “My foam topper I had previous to this mattress always made me too hot,” writes one reviewer. “But this cool gel mattress really does stay cool compared to the foam topper. And it is not too hard. It seems to adjust nicely with my body weight. Glad I bought it.” Leisure Town Cooling Mattress Pad From $49.90 at Amazon With more than 8,500 reviews, this top-rated cotton mattress topper is filled with a down alternative to deliver comfort that reviewers love without heat and sweat. “I had tried several other toppers with the hope that it would provide some cooling relief,” writes one reviewer. “This topper did the trick. Not only did it make my mattress even MORE cozy, it is considerably cooler to sleep on. I would highly recommend this product.”"",",Napper Chelsea;Angela Ballard;Honeywell Quietset;Liz Boscacci;Rachel Lubitz;Christopher Sun,Walmart,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,2484;TAX_ECON_PRICE,10630;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,1182;TAX_FNCACT_EDITORS,4071;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,7072;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,7777;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,8487;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,8796;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,10540;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,9668;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,10124;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,10207;NATURAL_DISASTER_CHILL,11400;NATURAL_DISASTER_CHILL,11537;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,11569;TAX_FNCACT_STAFFER,4573;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATOR,3523;TAX_DISEASE_MENOPAUSE,293;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,901;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,3588;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,4530;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,4727;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,4838;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,6853;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,10410;TAX_FNCACT_FOUNDER,3721;WB_137_WATER,1951;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPER,4604;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPER,6442;TAX_WORLDBIRDS_GOOSE,6258;WB_135_TRANSPORT,8908;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,8908;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,8908;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,341;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,564;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1138;AFFECT,5465;GENERAL_HEALTH,2035;MEDICAL,2035;TAX_FNCACT_NURSE,2035;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12153;TAX_DISEASE_BODY_WEIGHT,11892;",Arizona;California;Leisure Town;Portugal
269,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/tech/pelosi-taiwan-flight-tracker/,"""articleBody"":""US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s flight to Taiwan, which bolstered American support for the island nation but angered China, was the single most heavily tracked flight in the history of the online flight tracking site Flightradar24. The website, which uses a network of receivers to track planes’ location and speed, said Wednesday that more than 708,000 people across the globe were tracking the flight when it landed in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei. And more than 2.9 million people tracked at least a portion of the flight amid uncertainty about whether Pelosi would follow through on her pledge to visit the island nation, whose independence is not recognized by China. Though the stop in Taiwan was not part of Pelosi’s offical schedule for her tour of Asia, a Taiwanese and US official confirmed to CNN on Monday that she would be making the stop off. The decision came amid warnings from Biden administration officials, who raised concerns about how China would respond. Pelosi, whose visit to Taiwan was the first of its kind in 25 years, said she intended the trip to make it “unequivocally clear” that the United States would “not abandon” the democratically governed island. She was greeted by Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, in a televised meeting. She thanked Pelosi for visiting and praised her commitment to democracy and bestowed on her Taiwan’s highest civilian honor. Beijing warned that Pelosi’s trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations” and responded with a series of military exercises that began on Tuesday. Pelosi traveled from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, to Taipei aboard a Boeing C-40C jet (a military version of the Boeing 737 jetliner) operated by the US Air Force, according to the flight tracker. The flight flew under the call sign “SPAR19.” Flightradar24, which started as a passion project by two aviation enthusiasts, said in a blog post that traffic on its website became so intense that it nearly brought down the tracker, and it was forced to limit access to the site for non-subscribers by implementing a waiting room feature. “An unprecedented, sustained interest in this particular flight led to extremely heavy load on Flightradar24 infrastructure. Our teams immediately began efforts to maintain the stability of our services. Unfortunately, due to the volume of users, it was necessary to deploy our waiting room functionality, which meters access to Flightradar24 for non-subscribers.” Shortly after Pelosi’s flight landed, the company was able to restore normal access for all users.

201,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/kentucky-flooding-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj/,"""articleBody"":""A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. Catastrophic floodwaters in Kentucky have killed more than three dozen people. Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday that the water “swept some people miles away from where they were” and that “it’ll take weeks to account for everybody.” Climate change has supercharged extreme weather events, including the deadly flooding that struck Kentucky, Missouri and Arizona last week. Yet the flooding throws a light on a wider truth: Low-income communities and communities of color bear the brunt of the climate crisis. Deke Arndt, the chief of climate science and services at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, recently underscored the uneven impact of climate change. “Lots of images of people getting rescued from high water this week. I worked with emergency (management) for 10 years, and here’s the truth: they never pull folks from their homes in affluent neighborhoods. Once you see it, you won’t unsee it,” Arndt tweeted last Thursday. “In the context of our changing climate, Big Weather, but especially flash floods, aggressively targets the vulnerable and underinformed,” he added.  Sixteen of the deaths in Kentucky occurred in Knott County, according to the governor’s office on Monday. Seven people were killed in Breathitt County, two in Clay County, two in Letcher County and three in Perry County. These five counties are among the poorest counties in the US, per data from the 2020 US Census. “The reality is that when creeks get up and out of their banks, they almost always find the folks who are already living closer to the margins, whether these are people in manufactured housing or mobile homes or people in homes that are well within the floodplain,” Arndt told CNN. “We saw it in eastern Kentucky last week. We saw it in my home region of western North Carolina last summer.” It’s an unrelenting theme, experts say: Flash floods, in particular, punch hard on already vulnerable communities. To help protect against climate-related hazards, we must think about disaster mitigation not as a short-term goal – but rather as a long-term one. Growth pushes vulnerable groups to the margins There are a few reasons why the climate crisis afflicts some communities more than others, said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy and the author of the 2021 book “Disasterology: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the Climate Crisis.” For one, over the course of many decades, low-income communities and communities of color have been built in locations that are more physically vulnerable to extreme weather events. “As a city expands, certain groups are usually pushed into marshlands or bayous or other high-risk areas,” Montano told CNN. Infrastructure also plays a role. Low-income communities tend to receive far less investment in their infrastructure, which in turn becomes more vulnerable. “So, when there is a rainstorm or another hazard happens, the infrastructure isn’t able to withstand those impacts like the more up-to-date infrastructure in a wealthier community can,” Montano continued.  Other social vulnerability issues matter, too. Wealthier people have the money to construct their homes using higher-standard building materials and building codes. Further, wealthier people have more money to spend on mitigating hazards. “Think of the infamous example of celebrities in California hiring private firefighters,” Montano said. “They’re better able to protect themselves when these hazards happen.” Njoki Mwarumba, an assistant professor of emergency management and disaster preparedness at the University of Nebraska Omaha, echoed some of Montano’s sentiments. “One thing that’s consistently misunderstood and that doesn’t receive the attention it needs is the fact that people don’t wake up and decide to be vulnerable,” Mwarumba told CNN. “Often, when we try to address people in their communities from a point of vulnerability, we miss the systems that made that vulnerability.” Miseducation, historical trauma in Native American and Black American communities, marginalization and disinvestment: Many variables compound to create vulnerability. What ought to happen next? Mwarumba explained that we should direct more of our attention – our knowledge, our data – toward addressing some of these root causes of unsafe conditions. “This is important, because during recovery, you want to think about not only the immediate response but also long-term mitigation,” she said. In the aftermath of a disaster, people frequently say that they want to go back to “normal.” That impulse is understandable, but people shouldn’t strive to return to normal, because normal was the problem in the first place. “You want to rethink your building needs,” Mwarumba said. “Because if you’re trying to quickly get back to normal, what that means is that you’re predisposing yourself to another event. And that event is actually going to be compounded, because you’re going to be dealing with the effects of the event you’re currently going through.” In other words, disasters are very comprehensive, as CNN’s Rachel Ramirez recently stressed, and it’s vital to consider what recovery and preparedness mean beyond just the present moment. Montano pointed out the significance of full, vigorous media coverage. “These disasters aren’t one-off events. The problems we see in Kentucky are going to look remarkably similar to the problems we see in Arizona, Missouri and anywhere else affected by a disaster,” she said. “This is important for the public to understand, because when you see problems come up again and again, that means these are systemic problems.” Sustaining media coverage matters, too. “The reporting on Kentucky is going to drop off in a few days, but in some ways, that’s when the disaster is really just beginning,” Montano said. The recovery from the flooding is going to be long and difficult. It’s crucial that media outlets continue to cover what’s happening and hold governments accountable. Indeed, what governments choose to do, or refuse to do, after a disaster matters greatly, and can have tremendous consequences for the people at the center of an extreme weather event. “We often frame climate change as a science issue or a technology issue or an energy issue or a politics issue,” Arndt said, “but it’s ultimately an anthropological issue.” Put a little bit more bluntly: Which lives do we value? And which do we put in harm’s way?"",",Njoki Mwarumba;Deke Arndt;Rachel Ramirez;Samantha Montano;Andy Beshear,University Of Nebraska Omaha;Massachusetts Maritime Academy;National Centers For Environmental Information;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOODS,1199;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOODS,2081;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,2456;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,3852;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,441;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,2790;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,6478;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,441;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2790;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,6478;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,441;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2790;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,6478;MARITIME_INCIDENT,2516;MARITIME,2516;WB_1773_CLIMATE_CHANGE_IMPACTS,850;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,401;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,661;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,717;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,843;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1157;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2375;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2613;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,6510;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4348;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4365;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,2537;KILL,211;KILL,1403;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,211;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1403;WB_571_CLIMATE_SCIENCE,725;TRANSPARENCY,6296;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,4329;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4329;TAX_ETHNICITY_NATIVE_AMERICAN,4348;ETH_INDIGINOUS,4348;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,1199;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2081;WB_699_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT,3910;WB_820_DISASTER_RISK_MANAGEMENT,3910;WB_1705_DISASTER_PREPAREDNESS,3910;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,3910;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,480;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,552;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,6169;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,480;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,552;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,6169;AFFECT,894;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODWATER,3362;NATURAL_DISASTER_HIGH_WATER,910;EDUCATION,2466;EDUCATION,3862;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2466;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,3862;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MASSACHUSETTS,2507;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,5592;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,5966;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,6224;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,5592;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,5966;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,6224;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5592;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5966;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,6224;LEADER,1364;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1364;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,408;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,850;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,6517;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,408;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,850;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,6517;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,408;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,850;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,6517;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODWATERS,187;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,187;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,706;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BEAR,636;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3928;WB_137_WATER,293;WB_137_WATER,910;SCIENCE,725;SCIENCE,6530;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,3437;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,4243;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,4294;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,4461;WB_695_POVERTY,3437;WB_695_POVERTY,4243;WB_695_POVERTY,4294;WB_695_POVERTY,4461;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6588;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,779;WB_756_VULNERABLE_GROUPS,2318;WB_421_SOCIAL_INCLUSION,2318;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,2318;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,4356;",Letcher County;Breathitt County;North Carolina;Knott County;Arizona;Nebraska;Washington;Clay County;Perry County;Kentucky;Missouri;California;American
161,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/brittney-griner-trial,"""articleBody"":""American women’s basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time Thursday in a case that has raised concerns she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Judge Anna Sotnikova of the Khimki city court delivered the sentence and fined Griner 1 million rubles, or about $16,400. She said the court took into account Griner’s partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail. Prior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech. “I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” Griner said. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom. “I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,” she added. After the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, “I love my family.” The verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry. Griner’s lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal. “We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in the statement. “This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.” Speaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole. Griner “is not doing fine today,” said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held. Sentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations The harsh sentence comes amid the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s saber-rattling with the US and Europe. The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely. Charge d’Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a “miscarriage of justice,” and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was “unacceptable.” “Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence “puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.” He said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. “This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department’s,” Blinken said. It’s now “up to the Russian side” on whether Griner’s conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.  “We’re still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they’re more empowered to do that, then so be it,” Kirby told reporters in Thursday’s White House briefing. Kirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul and Brittney home.” CNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia’s court proceedings are not legitimate. “This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,” he said. “What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.” Last week, CNN reported that the Biden administration proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, but US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer. The Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.” Griner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.  The Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a “We Are BG” T-shirt,  said after the game the verdict was devastating. “Nobody wanted to even play today,” she told reporters. “How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.” Earlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict “a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare” of her detention. “We are inspired every day by BG’s strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,” the statement reads. Head coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner’s sentence is “unacceptable.” “It’s just heartbreaking,” the coach said. “To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.” In a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.” “The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,” they said. Defense asked for leniency in closing arguments  The court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant’s cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason. In closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued. Even if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor’s prescription, she added. She couldn’t have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said. Boykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication. Boykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, “Basically, it means that you are guilty.” Throughout the trial, Griner’s attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution’s case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport. Her detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.  After she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.  No lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest. On Tuesday, at the seventh hearing in her case, a defense expert testified that the examination of the substance contained in Griner’s vape cartridges did not comply with Russian law. Blagovolina also told CNN her team’s experts identified “a few defects” in the machines used to measure the substance. At trial, Griner testified she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said. “We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said.

555,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/chips-semiconductor-manufacturing-science-act/,"""articleBody"":""Congress has passed a bill that will invest more than $200 billion over the next five years to help the US regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing.  With bipartisan support, the CHIPS and Science Act was passed by lawmakers in late July, and President Joe Biden signed the bill into law Tuesday. Once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing, the US has lost ground as other countries like China ramped up production, forcing many American manufacturers to import chips – which are essential to the production of cars, smartphones and medical equipment.  The new funding is intended to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the US and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions. The current global chip shortage has limited production of new vehicles, for example, leaving Americans facing stubbornly high car prices. Chip maker Intel is already expected to reap some of the benefits of the new funding, specifically to help boost its previously announced investment to build a semiconductor plant in Ohio.  “This new law gives people like me a chance and allows us to grow our businesses,” said Joshua Aviv at the bill signing event at the White House on Tuesday. Aviv is the CEO and founder of an electric vehicle charging company called SparkCharge that manufactures its parts at a factory in Buffalo, New York.  “For years, my industry has been at the mercy of the supply chain,” Aviv added. The legislation will spend money on a variety of manufacturing incentives aimed at boosting American chip manufacturing as well as investments in research, development and workforce training.  The spending is not paid for by any offsets and instead will add to the federal deficit.  Here’s what is in the spending package, according to summaries by Democratic leadership.  $52.7 billion for chip manufacturing and research The package will invest $39 billion over five years to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing. It will provide companies incentives to build, expand and modernize US facilities and equipment.  The legislation will also create a new 25% tax credit for companies that invest in semiconductor manufacturing equipment or the construction of manufacturing facilities. Private companies that receive financial assistance will be restricted from expanding certain chip manufacturing in China for 10 years.  The law will provide $11 billion over five years to the Department of Commerce to help spur research and development in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, to invest in new technologies and expand workforce training opportunities.  Another $1.5 billion will fund the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund to help telecommunications companies compete with Chinese telecom giant Huawei and limit the scope of other telecommunications companies with close ties to China. Millions of dollars will target workforce development to make sure workers are available to support more manufacturing. $170 billion for scientific research, innovation and space exploration The legislation calls for a historic investment in scientific research and development that amounts to nearly $170 billion over five years, an $82.5 billion increase in the federal government’s baseline authorization.  The majority of that funding will funnel through two government agencies: the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. The investments will help create a National Science Foundation Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships to accelerate American development in technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced manufacturing, 6G communications, energy and materials science.  The federal funding will also fund the creation of new regional technology hubs across the country, strengthen small manufacturers as well as reduce long-term supply chain vulnerabilities in areas such as advanced manufacturing, next-generation communications, computer hardware and pharmaceuticals. About $13 billion will go to education in the science, technology, engineering and math fields – known as STEM – including scholarships and fellowships, with a focus of increasing access to education in these fields in rural areas.  Universities, community colleges and high schools may be eligible for the money in an effort to strengthen America’s workforce so that it can support new chip manufacturing. “There is a great deal of money focused on providing the needed talent,” said Rep.

476,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/media/netflix-wall-street/,"""articleBody"":""Netflix has had a terrible 2022. In April, it said it lost subscribers for the first time since 2011. Its stock has tumbled more than 60% so far this year. Yet its recent struggles may not be the start of a downward spiral or the beginning of the end for the streaming giant. Rather, it’s a sign that Netflix is becoming a more traditional media company. Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) was originally valued as a Big Tech company, part of the Wall Street acronym, “FAANG,” which stood for Facebook\n            \n                (FB), Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) and Google\n            \n                (GOOG). Wall Street once valued the company at about $300 billion — a number on par with many Big Tech companies that Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX)’s business model ultimately couldn’t live up to. “I think Netflix was extremely overvalued,” Julia Alexander, director of strategy at Parrot Analytics, told CNN Business. “Unlike those companies that have different tentacles, Netflix does not have a lot of tentacles.”   But Netflix was never really a tech company.  Yes, it relied on subscriber growth like many companies in the tech world, but its subscriber growth was built on having films and TV shows that people wanted to watch and pay for. That’s more a like a studio in Hollywood than a tech company in Silicon Valley. Netflix looked a lot more like a tech company than, say, Disney, Comcast, Paramount or CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. But as those traditional media companies start to look a lot more like Netflix, Netflix in turn is starting to take page out of its rivals’ playbooks: It’s going to start serving ads and it has been releasing some shows over the course of weeks and months rather than all at once. Netflix has said that its cheaper ad tier and clampdown on password sharing may come next year. It’s partnering with Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) for its ad business. “I think in many ways the moves Netflix are making suggest a transition from tech company to media company,” Andrew Hare, a senior vice president of research at Magid, told CNN Business. “With the introduction of ads, crackdown on password sharing, marquee shows like ‘Stranger Things’ experimenting with a staggered release, we are seeing Netflix looking more like a traditional media company every day.” Hare added that Netflix’s former business strategy, which was “once sacrosanct is now being thrown out the window.”  “Netflix once forced Hollywood deeply out of its comfort zone. They brought streaming to the American living room,” he said. “Now it appears some more conventional practices could be what Netflix needs.” At Netflix right now, “a lot of these strategic moves are being made as they mature and move into the next phase as a company,” noted Hare. That includes focusing on cash flow and revenue rather than just growth. “In other words, old school business,” he said. — CNN Business’ Moss Cohen contributed to this report."",",Julia Alexander,Warner Bros;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Comcast;Disney;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,1001;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1079;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,790;EDUCATION,3052;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3052;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,2222;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,355;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1590;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2174;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2462;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,355;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1590;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2174;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2462;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,355;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1590;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2174;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2462;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,48;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,2305;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2712;ECON_STOCKMARKET,130;MEDIA_SOCIAL,492;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,681;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,842;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1981;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2263;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2522;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3061;MEDIA_MSM,1288;LEADER,2222;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2222;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2222;TAX_DISEASE_CONVENTIONAL,2773;TAX_FNCACT_SENIOR_VICE_PRESIDENT,2222;WB_290_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_ORGANIZATIONAL_DESIGN,687;WB_288_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_SECTOR_POLICY_AND_REGULATION,687;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,687;",Hollywood;American;New York
105,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/health/monkeypox-response-cavalry-sanjay-gupta/,"""articleBody"":""It’s hard to believe we are face-to-face with a new health crisis, monkeypox, before we are even out of the woods with the previous – but still very much current – crisis, Covid-19. The pandemic, which has held the United States and almost every other country in its grip, should have taught us valuable lessons about how to manage a public health emergency, but it seems we are making some of the same mistakes we made not even three years ago, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus started to spread.  Testing for the monkeypox virus, once very limited, is now more available, but underused. The demand for vaccines is outpacing the supply. There are nearly 2 million courses the highly effective TPOXX antiviral sitting in the Strategic National Stockpile, but many health care providers are still having a hard time getting the medication for their patients. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, spending more than $4 trillion dollars a year on health care, more per person than anywhere else. With all those resources and technology, it’s not as if the United States is incapable of mounting a significant response to an emerging outbreak. And there is little doubt we will eventually do what should have already been done: declare monkeypox a public health emergency, appoint a national coordinator and mount a more significant response. But why do we wait so long, drag our feet and endure so much suffering in the meantime?   As I have learned over the past few years, there is a significant difference between preparedness and response, even though the two are often conflated. The United States is extraordinarily prepared, ranked No. 1 for pandemic preparedness in the 2021 Global Health Security Index.  Instead, we are leading in a different way. As of today, we have the most confirmed cases of monkeypox on the planet, more than 5,000. That is almost 25% of the global numbers, even though we are just under 5% of the world’s population.   It is now clear: Preparedness alone does not guarantee a rapid response. With Covid-19, and now monkeypox, we were too slow to respond. It was as if we are sitting in a turbo-charged Ferrari, capable of massive acceleration, but instead only idling in the driveway.  Cavalry culture Over the past three years, we have witnessed something counterintuitive. It was predominantly wealthy countries that were hit hardest during the Covid-19 pandemic. They had some of the highest death rates, despite their enormous resources.  While there are many reasons for this, including misinformation, lack of public trust, and the entangling of public health and politics, I think there is something else, as well: We have adopted what I call a “cavalry culture.” We wait for the cavalry to ride in and rescue us, instead of taking smaller preventive steps – such as establishing modern and reliable data systems, mastering our supply chain along the way, and acting early to head off the outbreak in the first place.   If that sounds familiar, it’s because we too often do the same with our personal health matters. According to research published in The Lancet Public Health, nearly half of chronic disease in the United States is mostly preventable, with lifestyle changes. Even knowing that, however, the medical system is set up for the cavalry to come in with expensive medications and high-tech interventions, instead of providing equitable access and incentives for preventative care. There are a couple of important axioms in public health. One is, by the time you think you must act to contain an outbreak, it is already too late. And, if you think you are overreacting, you are probably reacting just the right amount. In the case of Covid, and now monkeypox, we seem to have forgotten those basic public health principles. And, the real question now seems to be: When will the government finally hit the gas pedal on our highly tuned Ferrari? I don’t want to suggest any of this is easy. There are significant issues of uncertainty and unpredictability. Much like a hurricane forming at sea, we often don’t know exactly where or how hard it will hit. We want to be measured, calm in our response and to cause as little disruption as possible. We want to be thoughtful and gather as much information as is available.  And therein lies one of our biggest problems: basic data. I have often wondered, how is it that a numbers-driven, high-tech country like the United States can’t get basic data right?  Data disaster As long as I’ve been reporting on the Covid pandemic, I have always had to offer the caveat that case numbers are probably off, sometimes wildly so. We have probably never had a clear vision on just how widely the virus was spreading at any given time in the United States, and going into the fall 2022, the situation isn’t really any better.  In early July, the Institute for Health Metrics, a research center at the University of Washington, released a model suggesting that actual Covid-19 cases are seven times higher than reported cases. At times, it seems the tech platforms for Snapchat and Twitter offer more data analytics than the patchwork of state and federal systems that underpin the public health of our country.  “First, there’s a lack of data access needed to understand where disease outbreaks are spreading. This is due to data collection limitations that Congress needs to fix,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  He said there is also a need to update analog systems and connect them to each other – getting them to speak the same language. Right now, it’s the Tower of Babel.  “Second, we lack sufficient numbers and, in some cases, skills of people and systems at the federal, state and local levels that can deliver services and communicate effectively with communities. Finally, we are in perpetual panic and neglect funding cycles,” he said. As a result of all of the things Frieden is describing, our current data collection and reporting system leaves important information fractured into dozens of states and territories, and thousands of county pieces for the CDC to puzzle together. “I have been struck as we at CDC are now conquering another public health challenge – monkeypox – as to how little authority we at CDC have to receive the data,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told the Washington Post.  Walensky is talking about basic data, like where the vaccine has gone, who has been vaccinated, whether the vaccine is working, and even monkeypox case data like who is getting infected, their age and race/ethnicity. Why might this be so?  “States don’t routinely share vaccine doses administered data with the federal government – Covid was really the first time that we were able to successfully put data use agreements in place,” Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN. Part of the reason is because “states have laws in place to protect identifiable information.” Some information has been getting to the CDC, but it is challenging to get and incomplete. The CDC director told the Washington Post, “We have been speaking to our state and local partners probably at least three times a week, all of them. … That is not how you synthesize data. We need … standardization of those data, and we need to have those data come to us in a standardized fashion so that they can be connected, we can compile them and rapidly report them out. We cannot at CDC collect the data and make informed decisions by calling 64 jurisdictions, and honestly, 3,000 counties.”  The CDC is currently working on agreements that would broaden the agency’s access to states’ data, as they successfully did with Covid. Hannan explained, “The need to quickly get the [monkeypox] vaccine out left no time to get data sharing agreements in place.” But even if those agreements were in place, it still doesn’t mean the states’ ability to actually obtain vaccine doses would be made any easier. That’s because the states wouldn’t be using the same data system for ordering and tracking doses they generally use. Because the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response are in charge of monkeypox vaccine distribution, there would be yet another data system involved.  “They were asking states to request the vaccine using paper forms and email,” said Hannan. “They were asking states to complete forms [with fillable fields] on those who were receiving the vaccine and return these forms to the federal government.”  The problem was there weren’t even the right fields for the specific questions being asked, such as reason for vaccination or type of exposure or risk, Hannan said. It wasn’t that the necessary forms weren’t being filled out, it was that they couldn’t be filled out because of disparate data platforms.  It is a baffling level of bureaucracy in the middle of an unfolding outbreak. Testing, vaccines, therapeutics As things stand now, the issues with data collection, testing, vaccines, treatments and communication are sounding a lot like the ones we experienced with Covid-19.  But, to be clear, monkeypox is not that much like Covid. For now, it seems to spread primarily through sores or lesions during close, personal touch and shared objects like towels and linens, as well as respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact.  The monkeypox outbreak is also different for another fundamental reason. Unlike with Covid, which was caused by a novel virus, the basic tools already exist either for monkeypox or its close relative, smallpox. We didn’t have to build them from scratch. That means we could have had them or put them to better use by now. Take testing. At the start of the outbreak, testing capability was capped at about 6,000 tests per week, which meant that doctors really had to ration them to a narrow group of people – primarily a subset of men who have sex with men. Since then, the CDC has partnered with five labs to scale up our capabilities and we should soon be able to process up to 80,000 tests a week. But the tests are being underutilized, according to CNN reporting. Experts blamed the low uptake on several factors, including a lack of awareness among doctors about the virus and the fear of stigma among patients. So, just as with Covid, the real scope of the monkeypox outbreak is probably underappreciated. Confirmed or probable cases stand around 5,000, according to CDC data, but the number could be several fold higher.  Another tool that could be tremendously helpful is testing of wastewater. As we have seen with Covid, it can better define the scope of the outbreak and where it will emerge next. Two months into the outbreak, we still aren’t doing this widely for monkeypox.    And then there are vaccines. Unlike Covid, where we spent upward of $20 billion to develop, test and distribute vaccines, we already have a vaccine specifically approved for monkeypox. Supplies were limited and the initial US vaccination strategy focused on known monkeypox cases and their immediate contacts. But the outbreak continued to grow, and the strategy had to change. The count of people eligible for the two-dose Jynneos vaccine has now expanded to an estimated 1.5 million.  With that same cavalry culture, we are woefully behind in getting those doses to people who want them. At this time, only 336,710 doses have been shipped to states. Ordering only just began for about 800,000 more doses. This scarcity has created long lines in monkeypox hotspots like New York City, which has the highest number of cases in the country.  It also means that the vaccine, which can be given within 14 days of exposure (but preferably within four) to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, is currently being used more as a treatment – a post-exposure prophylaxis – rather than as a real preventive measure. As National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN, that focus will have to shift.  “It’s very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,” Fauci said. “What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure but go well beyond that.” It’s a missed opportunity that won’t be rectified immediately, even with the soon-to-arrive 786,000 doses announced by HHS this week. Needs will still outstrip supply. Finally, there is the issue of treatment. The CDC has made the antiviral smallpox treatment tecovirimat, called TPOXX, available to monkeypox patients who have or are at high risk of severe disease under an “alternate regulatory mechanism.” There are 1.7 million courses of TPOXX stockpiled. But once again, getting the medication to patients who could immediately benefit has proven to be bureaucratically burdensome for both patients and providers. “You’re talking about a five, six-day time lag to get that medication to you at a local doctor’s office, no matter where you are. And the paperwork, and all of the bureaucracy to make that happen is very cumbersome, takes a few hours of your time. And that’s the barrier,” Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the LGBTQ-centered Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, told me recently.  Fortunately, those rules were loosened somewhat last week, allowing patients to get treated more quickly and reducing the amount of documentation needed. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration are working to further streamline the process.  In the meantime, though, patients are suffering. Even though most cases are “mild,” they are still uncomfortable, or downright painful, depending on where sores appear. Plus, there is a risk of long-term complications if the pox lesions develop in areas around the eye or GI tract. All of these gaps have the hardest hit community on edge. “Largely public health officials know how this has spread. They know how to vaccinate people … we know how to treat it, and we know how to prevent it,” says Samuel Garrett-Pate, managing director of external affairs of Equality California, the largest statewide LBGTQ+ civil rights organization. “It unfortunately seems that despite two years of building up our public health infrastructure to prevent what happened with Covid-19 from ever happening again, despite the fact that we are better prepared in terms of already having a vaccine available, the CDC and FDA seem to be caught flat-footed once again. And I think as a result, you’re seeing very real and understandable fear anxiety among the LGBTQ community.” Is it too late? Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current board member of Pfizer, has been pessimistic about the trajectory of monkeypox in the United States. “We’re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that’s persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed and if it hasn’t closed, it’s certainly starting to close,” he said on Face the Nation on July 17.  CDC’s Walensky pushed back on Gottlieb’s assessment calling it “misinformed and off base,” saying that while it’s true there is much work to do, the US has made dramatic progress on priorities like testing, vaccines and education. There has been measurable progress in these areas, no doubt.  But, I do worry that we once again waited too long. We sat idling in our Ferrari, perhaps not wanting to believe that somehow we had suddenly found ourselves in the middle of yet another outbreak. I remember when I first saw a case of monkeypox – it was in 2008, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the handful of countries in Africa where the disease is endemic. To tell you the truth, I never thought I would see it in the United States. After all, it was a virus that hadn’t traveled much since it was first identified in DRC in 1970. My guess was that most of my medical colleagues in the United States would likely only see pictures of the distinctive pox lesions in textbooks.   The world, however, is changing, as we have been reminded of twice in the last few years. There are new pathogens emerging, and existing pathogens are more easily traveling the world. We have learned painful lessons in the last few years, and we are now in the midst of our first significant test since the Covid pandemic began, to see if we do any better this time around.  There is no doubt we are capable, and we are prepared. The question is will we use all those remarkable resources and respond, or we will wait and suffer until the cavalry has to rescue us once again?

389,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/trump-wins-cpac-straw-poll-dallas-texas/,"""articleBody"":""At the Conservative Political Action Conference Texas on Saturday, former President Donald Trump overwhelmingly won an unofficial straw poll of attendees who were asked who they preferred as the Republican nominee for president in 2024. “He’s more popular than ever,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump who conducted the straw poll. McLaughlin announced the results from the CPAC Texas main stage about two hours before Trump’s scheduled appearance. Among the attendees who voted, 69% said they preferred Trump, with 24% saying they would prefer Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. When asked about who they would prefer if Trump did not run for president, 65% of respondents said they preferred DeSantis, while 8% said they would support Donald Trump Jr. The straw poll is not a scientific survey, with a pool limited to CPAC attendees, and is not representative of the broader GOP electorate. The results are reflective of straw polls at previous CPACs since Trump left office, which showed the former President with a large lead among the conservative activists and DeSantis as the favorite alternative. In February, Trump won a straw poll at CPAC in Orlando, Florida, with 59% of the vote. DeSantis came in second in that poll with 28% of the vote, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came in a distant third with 2% of the vote. In a July 2021 CPAC straw poll, Trump topped the GOP field with support from 70% of conference attendees, compared to 21% who selected DeSantis last year. In an interview with New York Magazine last month, Trump said he was still deciding when – not if – he should announce a 2024 campaign. DeSantis is also widely considered to be a contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.

The coalition includes CNN, the Texas Tribune, and many of the state and the country’s biggest news outlets.  The news organizations have been fighting for weeks to obtain information on behalf of the public amid serial falsehoods and stonewalling from Texas officials in the aftermath of the mass shooting. The lawsuit, filed in state court in Austin, arises under the Texas Public Information Act, which enables news outlets and members of the public to pursue litigation to obtain records. The news outlets cited many previous requests for information and an “ensuing failure to disclose public records concerning this abhorrent tragedy.”  “The Texas Department of Public Safety has offered inconsistent accounts of how law enforcement responded to the Uvalde tragedy, and its lack of transparency has stirred suspicion and frustration in a community that is still struggling with grief and shock,” said Laura Lee Prather, a First Amendment lawyer at Haynes Boone who represents the plaintiffs. “DPS has refused numerous requests by these news organizations even though it’s clear under Texas law that the public is entitled to have access to these important public records. We ask that the court grant our petition so that the people of Texas can understand the truth about what happened.” The suit notes that the public safety department has “selectively disclosed” information, but has dismissed more thorough records requests. Thus the news outlets want the court to order the department “to produce all responsive records.”  The other participating news organizations are ABC, CBS, NBC, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones, The Washington Post, and ProPublica; local TV and media companies Gannett, Graham Media, Scripps and TEGNA Nicole Carroll, the editor in chief of Gannett’s USA Today, said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” last month that the coalition is necessary because “we need to get to the truth.

Here, inside the gang-held territory of Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti’s SWAT team has driven into a gunfight that has already torn up a civilian bus.  “Can you see where it came from?” the SWAT members breathlessly asked each other inside the armored vehicle. It provides only a tiny sliver of a window onto the streets outside, which at one moment appear deserted, the next teeming with civilians trying to flee to safety.  In the past 72 hours, police have killed a leader of the 400 Mawozo gang and rescued six hostages from them, they say. But the gang - one of dozens terrorizing the capital - have not been dislodged from these streets.  “Can you see that red sign ‘SMS’? That’s them,” said a SWAT officer, indicating the gunmen’s position. Like his team, he did not want to be named, citing their safety. He pointed down the road towards a small shack, as dozens of people flooded from a side-alley into the street.  “Get away,” he said to the crowd, over the armored car’s loudspeaker. “You’re too exposed. It’s dangerous.”  The officer ordered the vehicle to move into a new position. “When we get to the spot, open up on anything that moves,” he said. Heavy gunfire between police and gang members followed.    It is a common scene of injury, gunfire and panic in one of the dozens of neighborhoods controlled by gangs as Port-au-Prince appears to descend into a full-blown war between police and increasingly well-equipped and organized criminal groups.  And this is a familiar routine: Police probe into gang areas to show their reach, and gangs respond with intense volleys of bullets.  In the area of Cité Soleil, ten days of violence in July left more than 470 people dead, injured or missing, according to the UN, after the G9 gang tried to expand its reach in the area, taking territory from rival gangs.  Social media video from inside the area shows gangs using a bulldozer covered with steel plates to act as armor demolishing homes, presumably those of rivals. Other houses had been burned, with other video showing dozens of locals fleeing the area on foot at night, during the peak of the fighting.  Civilians who fled Cité Soleil found little respite, with dozens receiving food handouts from the World Food Programme and sheltering in the open air of the Hugo Chavez recreational park.  Flies blanket the rain-sodden concrete floor of the sporting amphitheater stage, where children as young as four months struggle to sleep, exposed to the elements. One has bruises from a fall, another a painful and ugly rash, but they are alive.  Here, Natalie Aristel angrily shows us her new, unpalatable home.   “Here’s where I sleep in a puddle,” she said, pointing at the water. “They burned my house and shot my husband seven times,” she says, referring to gang members.  “I can’t even afford to go see him [in hospital]. In this park, even if they brought some food, there’s never enough for everyone. The kids are dying.”  Others are missing. “I have four kids, but my first is missing and I can’t find him,” another woman said. “We’ve been totally abandoned by the state and have to pay to even use a toilet,” another added.  A young boy added: “My mother and father have died. My aunt saved me. I want to go to school but it was torn down.”  Locals speak of a perfect storm of calamities – and warn the country increasingly feels on the verge of societal collapse.  What remains of the country’s emergency interim government, created last year after the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, is beginning to crumble and steeped in accusations of inactivity. His successor, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, has pledged to combat insecurity and hold new elections, but so far shown little progress toward either goal.  Meanwhile, analysts calculate inflation in the country at 30%. Gas is scarce and the subject of angry queues at stations. The UN has warned gang violence may put the youngest children in areas of active fighting at risk of imminent starvation, as their parents cannot access food or go to work.  One Haitian security forces source speaking to CNN estimated that gangs control or influence three quarters of the city.  Frantz Elbe, Director General of the Haitian National Police, rejects the assertion. “It is not a general problem in the metropolitan area,” he told CNN, declining to give a percentage.  Yet it is indisputable that vital parts of the national infrastructure are now entirely in criminal hands. The city’s vital port – Haiti’s main – is controlled by gangs, who dominate the road outside. So is the main highway to the country’s south, which means the fragile part of the country that was hit by an earthquake last year has been effectively cut off from the capital. Gangs are also expanding their control in the city’s east, where Croix-des-Bouquets lies, and in the north, around Cité Soleil, observers said.  Kidnappings are rampant and indiscriminate – one of few thriving industries in Haiti. Seventeen American and Canadian missionaries were kidnapped last year after visiting an orphanage in Croix-des-Bouquets, and only released after a ransom was paid to the 400 Mawozo gang.  Police, often outgunned, are doing what they can, Elbe tells CNN.  “The gangs are changing the way they fight. It used to be with knives, and now it is with big weapons. The police need to be well-equipped. With the little we have, we will do what we can to fight the gang members,” he said.  The challenge they face is exposed by a brief checkpoint set up in Croix-des-Bouquets, where a truck has been dragged across a main road by the gangs, and torched.  Police bring in an armored military bulldozer to push the wreckage to the roadside, which is already littered with other truck carcasses. The bulldozer operator, asked if he works under fire, replies: “Often.”   SWAT police set up a perimeter, scanning nearby rooftops. Locals and the vehicles they travel in are stopped and checked. One man says the situation is “bad, very bad,” before another gives him a stern glance.  He suddenly changes tone: “We know nothing.”  Fear is the currency of this war, though it is unclear if he fears speaking to the press, or the police, or what the gang may learn he said later.  To flee this fear, however, requires enduring more. A short boat journey from the mainland is the island of La Gonave, a hub for human traffickers.    The lackadaisical tempo and blue water of one tiny inlet on La Gonave belies its poverty. Heat, trash, hunger and the business of leaving dominate this world.  One, a smuggler who introduced himself as Johnny, calmly explained how his business works.  The journey is often one-way for the boat, so each endeavor requires the boat to be bought outright, at a cost of about US $10,000, he says. To cover that cost, Johnny needs at least two hundred customers, who will huddle in its disheveled hull.  Shreds of netting appear to plug any gaps between in the hull, and loose wooden planks will make up the boat’s interior. Johnny shows where the pump and motors will eventually go.  “If we die, we die. If we make it, we make it,” he said.  He added he hoped to pack his boat with 250 passengers, as he considered it in “good” condition.  The ultimate destination is the United States, with Cuba and the Turks and Caicos islands sometimes accidental stops along the way.  And it is from these three places that the International Organization for Migration has reported surging numbers of forced repatriations of Haitians in the first seven months of this year, with 20,016 so far, compared to 19,629 for all of 2021.  Some Haitians appear to be getting closer to the journey’s end, with the US Coast Guard interdicting 6,114 Haitians between October and late June – four times as many as between October 2020 and October 2021. In the past weekend alone, more than 330 migrants from Haiti were rescued by the US Coast Guard near the Florida Keys.   The numbers are as staggering as the risks. Previous journeys from this inlet have ended in tragedy. Johnny is unclear on the timing of the last boat, but precise about the potential losses: One recent trip he organized led to the deaths of 29 people.  “The boat had an engine problem,” he said. “Water got inside the boat. We called for help, but they took too long. The boat was sinking while I was trying to save people. When help came, it was too late.”  While CNN cannot independently confirm Johnny’s account of the system, two other locals who said they were involved in trafficking described similar details independently. Authorities in the neighboring Caribbean nations the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos have repeatedly reported finding the remains of would-be migrants after boats capsized in their waters.  Despite the risks, many Haitians are still desperate for a way out. Locals on La Gonave told CNN that at least 40 people who aimed to attempt the boat trip were already on the island and the rest would follow from the mainland once Johnny said the boat was ready.  One potential passenger, a university graduate who was once a teacher, described why he would risk all to take the voyage.  “I worked as a teacher, but it did not work out. Now, I am driving a motorcycle every day in the sun and the dust. How will I be able to take care of my family when I have one?”  He said he saved a year’s money to make the journey, and did not fear the rickety conditions of the boat. “I can be eaten by a shark or make it to America.”"",",Ariel Henry;Hugo Chavez;Jovenel Mo;Natalie Aristel;Frantz Elbe;Frantz Elbe,International Organization For Migration;Haitian National Police;World Food

561,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/wisconsin-senate-race/,"""articleBody"":""Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes are political opposites. But as the two prepare for what could become one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2022 cycle, they are leveling similar attacks to define each other: Casting their opponent as too extreme and out of touch with Wisconsin voters, while arguing the other is not a true representative of the state’s working class. “The problem is Ron Johnson has turned his back on working people and I’ve fought for working people my entire career, even before I was an office,” Barnes said when asked for the single biggest difference between himself and Johnson, who made millions running a plastics manufacturer before he entered public office. “His wealth isn’t the problem – it’s the fact that he is ultra-wealthy and out of touch.” Johnson’s campaign declined to make him available to CNN, but a Johnson campaign adviser previewed a notably similar message.  “(Barnes) is out of touch with where the majority of the state is,” said adviser Ben Voelkel, citing some of the more liberal positions Barnes has backed throughout his career. “Mandela Barnes talks a lot about his dad working the third shift work. … Mandela Barnes hasn’t done any of that. He has been a career political activist.” Johnson has already described Barnes as Democrats’ “most radical left candidate,” adding that “a radical left Senator from Wisconsin is not the solution.” Johnson recently called him “a progressive puppet out to fundamentally change America.” The attacks – delivered ahead of Tuesday’s Wisconsin Senate primaries, which appear to be already decided – are previews of what will likely become an acrimonious race, one that experts expect will see tens of millions spent on negative advertising as each side attempts to solidify their base voters in November. Johnson, the incumbent, faces no primary challenge after he opted to run for a third term. The senator, who promised to only serve another full term when he ran for reelection in 2016, waffled on the third term for months, but eventually decided to get into the race because “America is in peril” and he wants to end Democratic control of Washington. Barnes initially had significant primary challengers, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who spent more than $11 million of his own money airing ads throughout the state. But over the span of a week last month, Barnes’ three top primary opponents – Lasry, Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson – all dropped out of the race and endorsed the lieutenant governor, effectively ending the primary. “I could not have imagined it ending up this way,” Barnes told CNN. “To me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the democratic majority is.” As the two candidates turn their focus on each other, Wisconsin represents yet another example of a high stakes Senate race where the contrast between candidates is significant, including Republican Herschel Walker vs. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Republican Mehmet Oz against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Republican Blake Masters vs. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona.  ‘The most vulnerable Republican incumbent’  The Barnes strategy is to define Johnson as a changed man, someone who went to Washington as an insurgent candidate but then enmeshed himself into the Republican Party led by former President Donald Trump. The attacks will include Johnson’s own admission that the 2017 tax bill passed by Republicans in Washington benefited his own company; his reported role in attempting to push a slate of fake electors after the 2020 election; and his more recent suggestion that Social Security and Medicare, two popular social spending programs, be changed from mandatory to discretionary spending, something experts argue could effectively end the programs. “What we ought to be doing is we ought to turn everything into discretionary spending so that it’s all evaluated so that we can fix problems or fix programs that are broken that are going to be going bankrupt,” Johnson said earlier this month. Barnes wasted no time jumping on the comment, using it to argue that Johnson’s personal wealth makes it impossible for him to understand what these programs mean to working class people. “If he wants be anti-Social Security, that’s on him,” Barnes told CNN, using the Johnson comment to inoculate himself from Republican charges of being too extreme. “That’s much more extreme than wanting working families and people all across Wisconsin have a fair shot.” With the primary all but decided, Barnes put out an attack ad earlier this month that hit Johnson on outsourcing jobs, using the senator’s defense of a company that took jobs out of Wisconsin. “Ron Johnson couldn’t be more out of touch with Wisconsin,” the ad says. Democrats are also preparing to paint Johnson as a candidate who has become a conspiracy theory promoter, including questioning the push to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, calling climate change “bullsh*t,” and suggesting – without any evidence – that the FBI had more inside knowledge than it let on about the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. Republican operatives working on Senate campaigns acknowledged the impact some of Johnson’s comments have had on his image. A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 46% of Wisconsin voters viewed him unfavorably, compared to 37% who had a favorable view. But one operative argued that some positive Johnson messaging over the summer, including significant spending by an outside group focused on inflation and a Johnson campaign ad focus on legislation that allowed for more experimental drug treatments, have done some rehabilitation. “His numbers are moving in the right direction,” the operative said, adding that, no matter what, “it is going to be a close race.” Democrats see negative views of Johnson as central to their plan of turning the general election into a referendum of the senator. “Ron Johnson is, without a doubt, the most vulnerable Republican incumbent on the map,” said Amanda Sherman Baity, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ‘Defined by all these left-wing positions’ The attacks on Barnes center on accusations that he is too extreme for the state, using his time as a community organizer, a state assemblyman from a solidly Democratic district and a “longtime leader” in the Working Families Party against him as he runs for Senate. The hits include his ties to members of the “Squad,” a group of liberal lawmakers in Congress who are often attacked by Republicans; a photo taken of him holding up an “Abolish ICE” T-shirt; and positions like ending cash bail, supporting the Green New Deal and a host of other views the Johnson campaign believes are too “extreme” for Wisconsin voters. Barnes has said he does not support abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but supports “addressing the concerns and issues and challenges that people have so that we can have a fair, comprehensive immigration reform system.” “All of these things are positions that might get you applause at a Working Families Party rally or get you the endorsement of AOC or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but when you look across the state, that is not where 50+1 of the state sits,” Voelkel said. One issue that Barnes’ campaign must confront is the fact that polls show that many Wisconsin voters don’t know enough about him to have an opinion – something that can be both helpful and hurtful. “Barnes is not nearly as known in the state as Johnson,” said Charles Franklin, pollster for the Marquette Law School poll, citing a recent poll that found over 50% of Democratic primary voters didn’t know enough about the lieutenant governor to form an opinion. “That is an opportunity for the Johnson side … to really try to step in and define Barnes.” And they plan to do just that, with the Johnson campaign and outside groups already gearing up to cast Barnes as out of step with most Wisconsin voters. “He is going to be defined by all these left-wing positions that he took in the past,” said Jack Pandol, spokesman for Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC focused on Senate races. “There is a lot that voters are going to be made aware of in the coming months and that will be the first information that some voters are getting about Barnes.” Barnes responded to these attacks by saying Republicans “tried to say the same thing about Tammy Baldwin,” and she went on to win the state’s other Senate seat in 2012 and reelection in 2018. “People like Ron Johnson are going to lie about whatever, anything he can think of, to take the heat off his own bad behavior,” he said. ‘We were polarized before it was cool’ The question among experts in Wisconsin is whether, after years of polarization and remarkably tight elections, there are even enough persuadable voters in the state to make the general election anything more than a base-focused race. Wisconsin has been a swing state for years. When Trump won it in 2016, he was the first Republican to win it since 1984. While Biden won the state back in 2020, the state has long had years of Republican governors, including Scott Walker from 2011 to 2019, and Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. “We were polarized before it was cool,” said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic operative in Wisconsin, arguing that the fights around union rights in 2011 and 2012 led to the state being deeply polarized long before the arrival of Donald Trump. “So that shrinking segment of swing voters is kind of the ball game. Yes, the political environment may be bad, but Republicans’ brand is rotten with those voters.” This is why political watchers like Franklin and others expect a deluge of negative ads in the contest, with both sides running campaigns that “reflect that polarization that we have had for a good 12 years.” Democrats are confident that if they can turn the race into a referendum on Johnson, there are enough votes who have backed him in the past who are ready for an alternative. “There is absolutely a world of ticket splitters, a world of persuadable voters and a world of people who might or might turn out,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.  Democrats do, however, face a difficult national environment, with President Joe Biden’s poll numbers slumping and voters across the country skeptical of Democratic leadership in Washington. With this in mind, Barnes argued it would be Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers – not the president – who would have the most direct impact on the contest. Evers himself is up for reelection. While he did not have a primary challenge, he will likely face a tough race against whoever emerges from what has been a tight Republican primary race on Tuesday. “This is a very Wisconsin focused race,” he said, citing a recent poll that found 48% of Wisconsin voters approved of Evers. “I would say that people know the work that we’ve been doing here in state and this race isn’t going to be determined about what people think about national politics.”"",",John Fetterman;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Mehmet Oz;Tom Nelson;Ben Voelkel;Scott Walker;Elizabeth Warren;Alex Lasry;Joe Biden;Charles Franklin;Ben Wikler;Raphael Warnock;Tammy Baldwin;Herschel Walker;Joe Zepecki;Jack Pandol;Tony Evers;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Amanda Sherman Baity;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Sarah Godlewski;Mark Kelly,Senate Leadership Fund;Republican Party;Democratic Party Of Wisconsin;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Marquette Law School;Marquette Law School;Families Party;Families Party;Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee;Wisconsin Senate,"TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,904;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,1021;EDUCATION,5414;EDUCATION,7699;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,93;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1263;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9651;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9747;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,394;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,25;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3032;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3108;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3179;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3269;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3457;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4516;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5273;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6127;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,8239;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9119;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9220;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9689;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,10821;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,25;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3032;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3108;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3179;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3269;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3457;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4516;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5273;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6127;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,8239;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9119;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9220;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9689;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,10821;LEADER,2611;LEADER,7820;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,1335;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,704;ELECTION,339;ELECTION,1808;ELECTION,5453;ELECTION,6898;ELECTION,7492;ELECTION,7772;ELECTION,8080;ELECTION,8301;ELECTION,8406;ELECTION,8947;ELECTION,9605;ELECTION,9723;ELECTION,10182;ELECTION,10416;ELECTION,10953;",Pennsylvania;Outagamie County;Wisconsin;Arizona;America;Georgia;Washington;Milwaukee
80,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/perspectives/cryptocurrency-government-regulation/,"""articleBody"":""Editor’s Note: Emily Parker is executive director of global content at CoinDesk and a former policy advisor at the US State Department and writer/editor at The Wall Street Journal. She is the author of “Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From the Internet Underground.” The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.  Cryptocurrency is having an existential crisis. Last month, crypto lender Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection. It has frozen withdrawals since June 12, and it’s unclear if or when customers will get their money back. But Celsius is just one domino to fall. Crypto lender Voyager Digital also recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Ordinary investors who deposited their money into Voyager likely don’t know if or when they will see their funds again. Bitcoin, meanwhile, recently fell more than 70% off its all-time high from last year. And back in May, TerraUSD (UST), a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to trade at $1, saw its price fall well below that, causing steep losses for those who held it or its sister coin Luna (Luna’s value was linked to UST). The underlying problem is a combination of risky lending, poor risk management and opaque finances. So when crypto prices crashed, likely as a result of fears of rising inflation and the possibility of a recession, some crypto companies didn’t have the capital to cushion the blow. The result has been the disappearance of billions of dollars in value, often with ordinary investors paying the price.  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are supposed to be independent of any government. But we have now reached the point where stronger government regulation of the crypto industry is both necessary and inevitable. At the same time, the industry can’t just wait for the government to act. Crypto companies must also try to better police themselves.  That starts with providing more transparency. While transparency is one of the core ideals of blockchain technology — all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are viewable for the world to see, for example — some crypto companies are strikingly opaque. In the case of Celsius, Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation has said that “customers did not receive critical disclosures about its financial condition, investing activities, risk factors, and ability to repay its obligations to depositors and other creditors.” At the very least, companies need to put much clearer warning labels on their products outlining the risks of depositing or investing with them, as well as more information about how customers’ deposits are being used. With stronger regulation, the Celsius situation might have played out differently. Its model was essentially to take user deposits and use them for risky and illiquid investments, and users enjoyed high interest rates in return. Celsius was essentially acting as a bank, without the regulatory protections or FDIC insurance. “Prudential regulation, such as those applying to banks, would almost certainly have prevented many of the problems in our sector,” Caitlin Long, CEO of depository institution Custodia Bank, said in an interview. “Prudential capital requirements, investment restrictions, background checks on all executives, annual supervisory exams — all those things don’t apply to the crypto industry. They do apply to banks though.” This kind of regulatory overhaul isn’t likely to come anytime soon, however. That’s why venture capitalists and ordinary investors alike should push companies for greater transparency and accountability, demanding audits and disclosures about lending practices and capital reserves. When crypto prices were sky-high, few took a hard look at these companies’ business practices.  The same was true with the stablecoin UST. When the market was strong, few publicly pointed out what are now obvious red flags, and those who did risked being shouted down by crypto enthusiasts on social media. Now, UST’s dramatic collapse may well hasten stablecoin regulation in the United States.  There are widespread concerns that some of the leading stablecoins are not nearly as stable as they claim to be. The fear is that if investors decided en masse to redeem their coins for the US dollars that supposedly back them, the stablecoin issuer would not have enough cash on hand to fulfill these orders. US lawmakers were reportedly closing in on a bipartisan deal to regulate stablecoins, but consideration for the bill has been delayed until after August. The bill, which is not yet public, would treat stablecoin issuers more like banks and subject them to federal supervision. It would also include strict requirements for the assets that back a stablecoin.  Another bill by Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand aims to bring more regulatory clarity overall by creating a standard for deciding which digital assets are commodities and which are securities. That would help clarify which assets are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission vs. the Securities and Exchange Commission. A clearer and more consistent regulatory framework around what companies can and can’t do, as well as which federal agency regulates which digital assets, could bring greater protections for ordinary investors. Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the SEC, has long argued for more regulatory clarity. “If we decided that crypto lending is an area that we can implicate the securities laws, we could have sat down a long time ago and hammered out some rules around that that made sense,” she said in an interview, speaking in her personal capacity.  Instead, what you often get is regulation by enforcement, where companies are punished after the fact. One of the problems with these one-off enforcement actions is that they don’t necessarily cover the whole crypto landscape. “Not only is that not particularly fair, because sometimes enforcement actions come late, and sometimes it’s a question of ‘why did you go after this project instead of this project,’ but also because it allows people who are really doing bad things to get lost in the shuffle,” Peirce said. These proposals are all steps in the right direction for starting a serious conversation about crypto regulation. But given other priorities in Washington, it’s unclear when new regulations would take effect or what they will look like in their final form.  Smart regulation is necessary, but it won’t be enough. Crypto innovation moves faster than any government’s attempt to rein it in. Political negotiations can also delay the passage of bills. Furthermore, with every new crisis, cryptocurrency loses more credibility. This could lead regulators to crack down harder than they would have otherwise, stifling innovation in a still-evolving field. An industry that prides itself on decentralization shouldn’t rely on the government to save it from itself."",",Emily Parker;Hester Peirce;Luna Luna;Cynthia Lummis;Kirsten Gillibrand,Exchange Commission;Commodity Futures Trading Commission;Vermont Department Of Financial Regulation;Us State Department;Prudential;Prudential;Custodia Bank;United States;United States,"UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2175;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1624;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1688;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3265;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,6707;ECON_INFLATION,1247;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1247;WB_442_INFLATION,1247;TAX_ECON_PRICE,946;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1449;EPU_CATS_FINANCIAL_REGULATION,2854;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLARS,4164;TAX_FNCACT_COMMISSIONER,5214;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,2835;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,3322;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,4721;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,5012;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,5263;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,193;DELAY,4407;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,4407;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,4407;ECON_BUDGET_DEFICIT,2708;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,370;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,6527;TRANSPARENCY,1837;TRANSPARENCY,1857;TRANSPARENCY,3478;SECURITY_SERVICES,1778;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1778;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1778;SCIENCE,6375;SCIENCE,6669;SOC_INNOVATION,6375;SOC_INNOVATION,6669;MEDIA_SOCIAL,3877;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,3877;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,3877;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,3877;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,48;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1531;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1590;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1722;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6408;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6778;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1531;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1590;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1722;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6408;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6778;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,5359;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,5359;WB_969_CAPITAL_MARKETS_LAW_AND_REGULATION,5359;WB_853_FINANCIAL_LAWS_AND_REGULATIONS,5359;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,48;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,6441;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,4085;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,39;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3877;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3877;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3877;LEADER,4287;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,4287;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4287;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,4287;WB_1973_FINANCIAL_RISK_REDUCTION,2864;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,2864;WB_337_INSURANCE,2864;WB_1967_AGRICULTURAL_RISK_AND_SECURITY,2864;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_US_DOLLARS,4164;NEGOTIATIONS,6454;WB_840_JUSTICE,6454;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,6454;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,6454;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,6454;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,6454;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,6454;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,6454;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,6454;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,6;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,147;USPEC_POLICY1,96;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,96;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVES,3179;ECON_BITCOIN,338;ECON_BITCOIN,6544;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,2758;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,2758;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,2758;ECON_ENTREPRENEURSHIP,3404;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATORS,6595;TAX_FNCACT_WRITER,140;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,3019;WB_698_TRADE,925;LEGISLATION,5359;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,1601;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,2126;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,2569;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,2889;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,3944;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,5563;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,6147;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,6321;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1601;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2126;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2569;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2889;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,3944;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,5563;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,6147;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,6321;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,6609;",Washington;Vermont;United States

View more opinion on CNN. “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom.”  It’s an unthinkable statement for a grief-stricken parent to have to make: testifying that her 6-year-old son, murdered while he sat in school, had actually lived, and that she was the woman who had given birth to him and raised him for the too-few years he was alive. But that was the testimony Scarlett Lewis gave this week at a hearing to determine damages against Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and media personality. (Jones was held responsible for defamation in a default judgment earlier this year.)  After 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jones began to spin lurid conspiracies that the shootings never happened and that the shattered families were simply actors. The conspiracy triggered years of harassment as conspiracists targeted the mourning parents, who have had to hire security to protect themselves. Since the defamation suits were filed, Jones has apologized and claimed he was in the grip of a “form of psychosis” that caused him to believe the conspiracy theory. The Sandy Hook conspiracy made Jones the talk-radio equivalent of the Westboro Baptist Church, which staged vile anti-gay protests at soldiers’ funerals. But within just a few years, Jones would become part of the right-wing power structure, from his interviews with soon-to-be president Donald Trump to his alleged role as an organizer at the January 6 insurrection.  More than that, many in the Republican Party and conservative movement increasingly sound like Jones, with talk of false flags, crisis actors and pedophile rings now a mainstay of right-wing rhetoric. And while the Trump presidency opened the door for the mainstreaming of Jones, it’s important to understand how ripe the GOP was for Alex Jonesification.  From its beginning in the 1940s and 1950s, the modern conservative movement embraced a conspiratorial mindset. From books that argued former President Franklin Roosevelt allowed the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor to unite Americans behind him in war, to the anti-fluoridation conspiracies of the John Birch Society, to the communist-around-every-corner witch hunts of the McCarthy era, conspiracy theories have become a core component of conservatism in America. But with the exception of McCarthyism, the conspiracy-minded right remained distinct from the Republican Party. Even right-wing politicians, especially those eyeing the presidency, shied away from the wild-eyed conspiracy-mongers popular with their conservative base.  That changed in the 1990s, as politics, entertainment and conspiracy became increasingly intertwined. Pat Robertson, the televangelist who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, published his conspiracy tract, “The New World Order,” in 1991. Drawing from several decades’ worth of conspiracies about “one-world government,” Robertson detailed a coalition of the Trilateral Commission, Illuminati, Bilderberg Group, Free Masons and others working to bring about a single global governance and, ultimately, the End Times. It was a New York Times bestseller.  Robertson wasn’t the only Republican presidential candidate warning about the new world order. It became a staple of Pat Buchanan’s speeches in all three of his presidential runs between 1992 and 2000. And while the phrase spoke to anxieties about the geopolitics of a post-Cold War world, it also nodded to the conspiracy theories that were becoming increasingly popular not just among the conservative base but for Republican officeholders as well. During the Clinton years, members of Congress held inquiries into black helicopters (a staple of 1990s conspiracies) and mainlined countless conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton.   Outside of Congress, the newly powerful right-wing radio of the 1990s and 2000s likewise paved the way for an embrace of Jones. Glenn Beck’s radio program cycled through conspiracies with breathtaking speed, pinging from Common Core to George Soros to Agenda 21, a United Nations-based conspiracy theory. He mixed politics and conspiracy not only in his content but his advertising.  Warning that the End Times were near, that catastrophe lurked around every corner, Beck pushed everything from gold to food storage to “survival seeds,” all aimed at helping listeners survive the impending collapse of society. (In the years since, Beck has admitted that he “played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart.”) These threads came together in the Obama years, as Beck became one of the most prominent voices in the Tea Party movement and conspiracism ran rampant on the right. That provided real opportunity for someone like Jones to make headway in US politics. While his grotesque Sandy Hook conspiracies did not gain traction in Republican circles, others did, such as the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy of 2015. Jones turned the routine military exercise in Texas into a new conspiracy theory, telling his audience falsely that it was a covert government effort to prepare for martial law.  That conspiracy theory quickly escaped InfoWars circles, making its way to right-wing talk radio and to Republican politics. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state militia to monitor the exercise. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, preparing for a presidential bid, also legitimated the conspiracy, saying that while he’d been assured by the military that it was a routine training exercise, “I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don’t trust what it is saying.”  Cruz’s pivot helps explain why the space between Jones and the GOP collapsed in the 2010s. The Republican Party spent decades arguing that government was corrupt, if not illegitimate, and grew increasingly reliant on right-wing media for the party’s messaging. So, it took very little effort to tip over into the world of wild conspiracies – especially once, with the election of Trump, Republicans realized there would be no price to pay for doing so.  The last few years have suggested that the bill is coming due – Trump lost the presidency and the Congress, Jones lost his defamation trial and several right-wing media outlets are facing hefty defamation suits for their election conspiracies. That hasn’t yet curbed the party’s conspiracy-mongering, though. Indeed, Alex Jones may never speak at a Republican convention or become a part of the Fox News primetime lineup. But he doesn’t have to.

427,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/dan-newhouse-doug-white-washington/,"""articleBody"":""Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse and Democrat Doug White will advance to the general election out of the top-two primary in Washington’s 4th Congressional District, CNN projects. Newhouse is one of the 10 Republican House members who voted for then-President Donald Trump’s impeachment in January 2021 following the attack on the US Capitol. Trump had endorsed Republican challenger Loren Culp in the district.  Washington holds open primaries in which all candidates, regardless of party, appear on the same ballot, with the top two finishers advancing to the November general election. Despite facing anger from his own party over his impeachment vote, Newhouse had a number of factors going his way this week: The incumbent handily outspent his challengers, the field was large and fractured, and Washington state’s open primary system allowed people to vote for any candidate, regardless of affiliation. Newhouse’s victory is a loss for Trump, who made defeating the 10 House Republicans who joined Democrats to impeach him a central goal to his post-presidency. By moving on from the primary, Newhouse is likely to keep his congressional seat. His district, which stretches from Washington’s borders with Oregon and Canada, overwhelmingly leans toward Republicans. Aside from White and Culp, the field also included former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler and state Rep. Brad Klippert. Local Republican operatives, many of whom censured and criticized Newhouse after his impeachment vote, worried that many people had moved on from impeachment and caused Republicans to focus on other issues as they went to the polls on Tuesday. Newhouse also seized on his agriculture expertise, using it to appeal in the largely rural district and draw some of the focus away from impeachment.

366,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/uber-q2-earnings/,"""articleBody"":""Even higher gas prices and soaring inflation aren’t slowing down Uber’s rebound from the worst days of the pandemic.  Uber\n            \n                (UBER) on Tuesday said its revenue hit $8.1 billion during the three months ending in June, more than doubling from the year prior as more customers turn to the ride-hailing service.  The number of consumers and drivers using its platform are “at all-time highs,” the company said in its quarterly earnings report. Uber recorded 122 million people using its platform each month, up 21% from the prior year. Perhaps more stunning for a company with a history of substantial losses is that Uber said it had become cash flow positive, meaning it took in more money from its operations than it spent, excluding capital expenditures, which typically includes property and other physical assets. The company said it generated $382 million in free cash flow during the quarter. But Uber continued to be unprofitable in large part due to its investments. Uber recorded a net loss of $2.6 billion, much of which ($1.7 billion) was related to its investments in other, international ridehail businesses like Didi and Grab. (Didi, in particular, has been hit by a tremendous amount of regulatory pressure in China.) Uber’s business offers a unique window into consumer trends more than two years into the pandemic which initially decimated demand for travel (hurting Uber’s Rides business) and accelerated adoption of online food delivery (helping its Eats business). During the previous quarter ending in March, the company reported that its Rides bookings had exceeded pre-pandemic levels and delivery bookings were up 12% year-over-year. Uber has continued to push its delivery offerings. Late last month, Uber announced a new grocery ordering service. While ordering groceries through Uber Eats has been available on the platform for two years, the update includes new options to incentivize use, such as advanced scheduling of deliveries, live order tracking and product replacements recommendations. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement accompanying the results Tuesday that the company “delivered balanced growth” and did so “on a platform that’s larger than ever, with the number of consumers and earners using Uber now both at all-time highs.”  “No one wishes for a tough economic environment or elevated inflation that’s affecting so many of us, including Uber drivers,” Khosrowshahi added on a conference all with analysts Tuesday. But he said the economic environment has allowed Uber to show its strengths. Shares of Uber jumped more than 15% in early trading Tuesday following the results.  Uber’s results come as much of the tech industry is turning to hiring freezes and layoffs in an effort to weather a financial downturn marked by soaring inflation, rising interest rates, fears of a looming recession as well as the fallout from war in Ukraine. Khosrowshahi told staff in May that the company would cut costs and rethink its approach to hiring amid a “seismic shift” in the market. On the call Tuesday, Khosrowshahi stressed that the company can be, and has been, diligent about its expenses and still continue to grow. He also noted that Uber benefits not only from its size but also from its range of business offerings. “When we look at the competitive environment, this is the strongest we felt competitively globally since Nelson and I probably started here,” Khosrowshahi  said, referring to himself and the company’s CFO, Nelson Chai. Khosrowshahi has been at the helm of Uber since 2017. In a striking departure from the growth-at-all-costs model Uber popularized years ago, Khosrowshahi also noted: “You can’t spend your way to glory in any business.” Khosrowshahi said Uber has been able to “apply discipline” as it makes improvements to the platform to serve drivers better. That includes better onboarding to make it easier for workers to sign up and an easier way to toggle between driving and delivering. “Right now, the machine is working,” he said. Last week, Uber announced it would expand its Upfront Fares feature to more cities in the United States to give drivers more information about earnings and the customer’s destination before accepting a ride. Khosrowshahi said on the call that this feature is one of the top requests from drivers, while noting that “there’s a lot of algorithmic work that has to go into pricing that trip properly.”"",",Nelson Chai;Dara Khosrowshahi,Cnn;United States,"ARMEDCONFLICT,2930;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,2930;ECON_INFLATION,47;ECON_INFLATION,2412;ECON_INFLATION,2843;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,47;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2412;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2843;WB_442_INFLATION,47;WB_442_INFLATION,2412;WB_442_INFLATION,2843;EPU_ECONOMY,2379;EPU_ECONOMY,2553;GENERAL_HEALTH,115;GENERAL_HEALTH,1427;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,115;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1427;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,115;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1427;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,115;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1427;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,115;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1427;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,115;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1427;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,115;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1427;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,115;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1427;FUELPRICES,27;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,27;ECON_HEATINGOIL,27;ECON_EARNINGSREPORT,413;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,2867;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,2867;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,2867;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,1315;TAX_ECON_PRICE,27;WB_698_TRADE,2651;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1361;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1499;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1572;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3304;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3745;PROTEST,3599;STRIKE,3599;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2107;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3056;AFFECT,2427;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3932;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2391;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2565;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3361;TAX_FNCACT_CFO,3516;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,2521;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,863;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,863;WB_718_PUBLIC_INVESTMENT_MANAGEMENT,863;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,321;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,2466;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,3862;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,4168;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,4338;",Ukraine;China;United States

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Justice Samuel Alito stirred controversy with a speech at Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome last week. The video of the event was publicized Thursday by the school.  In what began as a serious speech about the need to protect religious liberty, Alito mocked foreign leaders who criticized the controversial decision he authored in the Dobbs v. Jackson case, which ended a federal right to abortion last month.  He then told his audience of mostly friendly law professors on a Roman holiday, “I had the honor this term of writing, I think, the only Supreme Court decision in the history of that institution that has been lambasted by a whole string of foreign leaders who felt perfectly fine commenting on American law…”  “One of these was former Prime Minister Boris Johnson,” Alito said before pausing for comedic effect. “But he paid the price,” he went on to add, in reference to Johnson’s resignation earlier this month.    Undoubtedly emboldened by the scattered laughter and light applause inspired by his Boris Johnson snipe, Alito then followed with a comment that fell completely flat. “But what really wounded me, what really wounded me, was when the Duke of Sussex addressed the United Nations and seemed to compare the decision, whose name may not be spoken, with the Russian attack on Ukraine.”    The Ukraine comment elicited an uncomfortable silence, which seemed to indicate the audience was confused about whether the story was meant to be funny or merely a reflection of Alito’s seemingly low opinion of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.  Alito’s comments about the Prime Minister and the Duke of Sussex were inappropriate for any Supreme Court Justice speaking in a foreign country or, for that matter, even in the United States. The court usually declines ruling on issues that involve foreign policy as the Constitution generally leaves these matters exclusively to the president, with the occasional advice and consent of Congress. There is no mention in the Constitution of roving Supreme Court Justices attacking foreign leaders who disagree with the court’s pronouncements.  This is a critical time for the reputation and stability of the Supreme Court, given the substantial anger expressed by many Americans concerning the reversal of Roe v. Wade after 49 years. There have been “court-packing” proposals supported by many in Congress. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Joe Biden have suggested a commission to study the idea. The proposal would increase the number of Supreme Court justices, thereby diluting the power of the court’s current conservative wing. With his speech in Rome, Alito demonstrated that he is no Antonin Scalia, whose wit and charm in public speaking appearances impressed many, including even those who disagreed with his conservative politics. Lots of Americans were undoubtedly surprised that Alito or any Supreme Court justice would be permitted to make public comments about a recent Supreme Court decision. Televised congressional hearings concerning nominees appointed to the Supreme Court have schooled Americans that they will always decline or deflect direct answers relating to any issue that may come before the court.   At his own confirmation hearing in 2006, Alito deflected questions about Roe v Wade with a version of an answer given by many other conservative nominees to the court saying that the decision was “an important precedent of the Supreme Court” and “it has been on the books for a long time.” This answer was then supplemented by an Alito comment suggesting that he wouldn’t pre-commit to his position on future cases because he wouldn’t want any litigant to believe he had already made up his mind about a case without first hearing the facts. Many Americans were probably shocked to hear a Supreme Court justice making a public speech of any kind. Although the justices do occasionally make public speeches, they are normally scrupulous in avoiding any discussion of issues related to pending or prospective cases. And issues regarding abortion are always on the docket of federal courts across the nation on their potential journey to the Supreme Court. The Dobbs v. Jackson case will not end litigation concerning the nuances of abortion-related laws throughout the nation.  Public confidence in the court does not require justices to avoid all speech-making, but it does require them to be sensible and discreet in the topics they choose. Alito has demonstrated extraordinarily bad judgment in discussing the Roe v. Wade controversy in a foreign nation, even in jest, while cases related to the abortion issue are pending in the United States.

339,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/defense-department-missing-january-6-texts/,"""articleBody"":""The Defense Department wiped the phones of top departing DOD and Army officials at the end of the Trump administration, deleting any texts from key witnesses to events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, according to court filings.  The acknowledgment that the phones from the Pentagon officials had been wiped was first revealed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit American Oversight brought against the Defense Department and the Army. The watchdog group is seeking January 6 records from former acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, former chief of staff Kash Patel, and former Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, among other prominent Pentagon officials – having filed initial FOIA requests just a few days after the Capitol attack.  Miller, Patel and McCarthy have all been viewed as crucial witnesses for understanding government’s response to the January 6 Capitol assault and former President Donald Trump’s reaction to the breach. All three were involved in the Defense Department’s response to sending National Guard troops to the US Capitol as the riot was unfolding. There is no suggestion that the officials themselves erased the records.  The government’s assertion in the filings that the officials’ text messages from that day were not preserved is the latest blow to the efforts to bring transparency to the events of January 6. It comes as the Department of Homeland Security is also under fire for the apparent loss of messages from the Secret Service that day.  Miller declined to comment. Patel and McCarthy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The US Army Public Affairs media relations chief, Col. Cathy Wilkinson, said in a statement that, “It is our policy not to comment on ongoing litigation.”  Paul Ney, former general counsel for the Department of Defense, told CNN that Tuesday’s revelation is the “first I’ve heard about DoD litigation in which there is any issue with the cell phone I turned in when I left DoD on January 20, 2021.  “I did not wipe the phone before I turned it in (or ever that I can recall),” Ney continued. “When I turned the phone in, I did not know what was going to be done with that device nor do I know what actually was done with that device after I turned it in. If DoD represented in litigation that the device was wiped after I left DoD on Inauguration Day, I believe that is very likely what happened and when it happened, but I do not know why.” American Oversight is now calling for a “cross-agency investigation” by the Justice Department to investigate destruction of the materials.  “It’s just astounding to believe that the agency did not understand the importance of preserving its records – particularly [with regards] to the top officials that might have captured: what they were doing, when they were doing it, why they were doing, it on that day,” Heather Sawyer, American Oversight’s executive director, told CNN.  Sawyer said that her organization learned the records were not preserved from government attorneys earlier this year, and that acknowledgment was then memorialized in a joint status report filed with the court in March.  “DOD and Army conveyed to Plaintiff that when an employee separates from DOD or Army he or she turns in the government-issued phone, and the phone is wiped,” the government said in the filing. “For those custodians no longer with the agency, the text messages were not preserved and therefore could not be searched, although it is possible that particular text messages could have been saved into other records systems such as email.”  The acknowledgment that the records were not preserved has taken on new significance in the wake of the ongoing scandal over the loss of Secret Service agents’ texts from January 6.  “It just reveals a widespread lack of taking seriously the obligation to preserve records, to ensure accountability, to ensure accountability to their partners in the legislative branch and to the American people,” Sawyer said.  The Secret Service has said that its texts were lost as a result of a previously scheduled data migration of its agents’ cell phones that began on January 27, 2021, exactly three weeks after the attack on the US Capitol. Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph Cuffari first learned those texts were missing as early as May 2021, CNN previously reported.  The pattern across multiple agencies has prompted her organization to write to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who is already facing a request from congressional Democrats that he take over the DHS’ probe into the missing Secret Service texts.  “American Oversight accordingly urges you to investigate DOD’s actions in allowing the destruction of records potentially relevant to this significant matter of national attention and historical importance,” the letter said, while citing calls from Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin that the Department of Homeland Security be investigated for similar failures, the letter, shared with CNN on Tuesday, said.  After filing the FOIA requests with the Defense Department and the Army, American Oversight says the Pentagon acknowledged the request on January 15, 2021. American Oversight then filed a lawsuit that March to force disclosure of the records. In addition to the FOIA obligations American Oversight says the Pentagon has ignored in failing to preserve the records, Sawyer also pointed to a separate federal records law also require that the government preserve records that have “informational value of the data in them.”  “I think it’s highly unlikely that anyone could argue with a straight face that communications happening between these top officials on January 6 would not have the type of informational value that the Federal Records Law is meant to reach,” Sawyer said. American Oversight is seeking records for several other Pentagon officials – some of whom remain within government service.  “For those custodians still with the agency, Army has initiated a search for text messages responsive to the FOIA requests, and estimates completing their supplemental search by the end of September,” the Justice Department said in the July joint filing said in the case.  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. What the Pentagon was hearing from the White House as the Capitol attack unfolded has been a focus of the House January 6 investigation, and lawmakers say that addressing the security lapses of that day is an aim of their probe. The House January 6 committee last week released testimony Miller gave to the panel denying that former President Donald Trump ever game him a formal order to have 10,000 troops ready to be deployed to the Capitol on January 6. “I was never given any direction or order or knew of any plans of that nature,” Miller said in the video. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment on records related to the Pentagon. A former Defense Department official from a previous administration told CNN that it is ingrained into new hires during their onboarding that their work devices were subject to the Presidential Records Act and indicated their communications would be archived. The source said it was assumed when they turned in their devices at the end of their employment, any communication records would be archived. This story has been updated with additional details.

In July 2021, Odenkirk collapsed on the Albuquerque, New Mexico, set while filming the sixth and final season of the show. He later confirmed that it had been due to a “small heart attack.” The star, who has been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and Emmy Awards for playing the titular character, has now revealed that he stopped breathing during the frightening episode but was saved thanks to emergency medical care on set.  Though he cannot recall the immediate aftermath of the incident, he now knows it happened at around 5:30 p.m. when the cast and crew were changing shots. At that time Odenkirk, now 59, mounted an exercise bike he used between shoots to watch a Chicago Cubs baseball game on TV, he said. In an interview with the Radio Times magazine this week, the actor recalled: “I went down on one knee, and then I went all the way down. I guess I said, ‘I don’t feel very good.’” The star, who plays con-artist-turned-lawyer Jimmy McGill who takes on the pseudonym Saul Goodman, said his co-stars Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler, and Patrick Fabian, who plays Howard Hamlin, grabbed his head and hand and “started yelling at me to stay on Earth.” “I wasn’t breathing,” he continued. “I mean, if nobody had been there, if they didn’t do that CPR, I’d have been dead in a few minutes.” He had three shots of the defibrillator then emergency surgery to clear the artery he called “the widowmaker.”   “Better Call Saul” is a prequel to the AMC hit “Breaking Bad,” which ran for five seasons between 2008 and 2013. That show introduced Odenkirk as Goodman, an attorney for Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston. In the final season of the show, actors Cranston and Aaron Paul reprise their “Breaking Bad” roles of White and Jesse Pinkman. Odenkirk told the Radio Times that the reunion was “the greatest joy ever,” adding: “The first episode I did on ‘Breaking Bad’ was a big scene with those guys in the desert, at 2 a.m., in a sandstorm. So to revisit the relationship now … I can’t say more than that. Because it’s a mindblower, man.” The series finale is scheduled to air on August 15."",",Patrick Fabian;Saul Goodman;Howard Hamlin;Bob Odenkirk;Bob Odenkirk;Bob Odenkirk;Rhea Seehorn;Jimmy Mcgill;Kim Wexler;Walter White;Bryan Cranston;Bryan Cranston;Bryan Cranston;Aaron Paul;Aaron Paul;Aaron Paul;Jesse Pinkman,Cnn,,Albuquerque;New Mexico;Chicago
345,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/wisconsin-tubing-stabbing-suspect-charged-with-homicide/,"""articleBody"":""The suspect accused of stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death and injuring four others while they were tubing in a Wisconsin river Saturday appeared in criminal court Monday, charged with intentional homicide. Nicolae Miu, 52, has been charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide and four counts of first-degree intentional attempted homicide, according to court records. Jeremiah Harrelson, a state public defender at the hearing, said Miu was tubing on the river with his wife and friends when they were separated as he was searching for a lost cellphone.  The attack stemmed from an “unanticipated random encounter” between Miu and the victims, Harrelson said. Miu said he acted in “self-defense,” the complaint said.  The complaint states Miu had brandished a knife when two females confronted him before a physical altercation broke out. One victim told investigators she was punched by Miu in the face, which gave way to a physical struggle as the group proceeded to push Miu, who fell into the water after he was punched by a male. Miu, who repeatedly called the attack “self-defense,” told Brandie Hart, a lieutenant with St. Croix County court, he approached the group while searching for the cellphone with his snorkeling gear to ask if they had seen the device. He said they started insulting him, took his snorkel gear, threw it into the river and attempted to pull his pants down, according to the complaint. Miu said he doesn’t remember anything after people hit him and got on top of him until he ran back to his wife and friends, according to the complaint. Miu was arrested about an hour and half after the attack as he was exiting the river downstream. The 17-year-old who died in the stabbing was identified in a statement by his family to CNN affiliate KARE as Isaac Shuman. “Isaac entered every room with a big smile, infectiously positive aura and lifted everyone around him up,” the statement reads. “He had an incredibly bright future ahead of him, and we are all heartbroken and devastated beyond words that his future has been tragically and senselessly cut short.” Miu’s next court appearance is scheduled for August 5, according to court records."",",Jeremiah Harrelson;Brandie Hart;Nicolae Miu;Isaac Shuman,Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,829;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,829;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,171;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1065;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,62;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_LIEUTENANT,1321;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT,1321;WB_137_WATER,1201;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1046;TRIAL,27;KILL,604;KILL,683;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,604;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,683;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,604;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,683;SOC_GENERALCRIME,199;SOC_GENERALCRIME,264;ARREST,1789;WOUND,73;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLIC_DEFENDER,442;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,442;WB_840_JUSTICE,442;WB_942_ACCESS_TO_JUSTICE,442;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,627;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,706;",Wisconsin River;Wisconsin
241,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/investing/robinhood-berkshire-hathaway-trading/,"""articleBody"":""It’s no secret that Warren Buffett isn’t a fan of Robinhood.  The Oracle of Omaha has been sparring with the online brokerage platform since 2021. Until now, the fight has been over a difference in their philosophical views of the stock market.  A recent paper by three academics may have made it more personal, though.  At more than $440,000 per share, there typically isn’t a lot of trading activity around Buffett’s prized Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) A stock: Between 2010 and 2020, an average of 375 shares were exchanged daily. Then, in February 2021, trading volume shot up to nearly 2,000 shares per day, where it’s remained ever since.  The increased activity captured the attention of market watchers but remained a mystery. Some speculated that there was a superbuyer scooping up the stock.  But research published last month by professors at University of California, Berkeley, Columbia Law School and Cornell University found that the turbo boost in trading hasn’t been the result of any superbuyer. Instead, volumes of the most expensive stock in the US have been artificially inflated by the way brokers like Robinhood report fractional trading. The increases come from what researchers call “phantom, non-existent trading.” When a brokerage makes a private, off-exchange stock trade, like the fractional trades executed by Robinhood, they are required to report the trades to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as though they were for a full share. Under this “rounding up rule” an investment as small as 1/100th of a share in Berkshire Hathaway would count as a purchase of a full $440,000 share.   Researchers say that this “well-intentioned but misguided” FINRA rule has added an additional volume equivalent of more than a billion dollars a day to Berkshire Hathaway A shares. The reported phantom volume represents 80% of their daily trading volume. DriveWealth, which processes stock trades for investing apps like Cash App, also reported fractional share trades in Berkshire to the FINRA database and drove up trade volume, the study found. “The FINRA reporting rule for fractional trading has created significant distortions,” wrote the authors of the paper.  A FINRA representative told CNN Business that the agency “is already actively working on the issue, and is engaged in ongoing discussions with firms and regulators.”  Fractional trading brokerages like Robinhood, meanwhile, are “a fly in the ointment,” to Buffett, Robert Bartlett, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and co-author of the study.  “Buffett wants to keep the price of his Class A shares high to attract long-term value investors,” he said. “Those aren’t the people buying these fractional shares, and so they are undermining his main vision for the stock.”  ‘Adversaries’ of change vs. ‘casino’ groups  Buffett doesn’t mince words when speaking out against Robinhood. The brokerage is “a very significant part of the casino aspect, the casino group, that has joined into the stock market in the last year or year and a half,” he said at his Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2021, referring to the recent meme-stock craze.  Charlie Munger, Buffett’s right-hand man, joined in at this year’s shareholder meeting, calling the brokerage’s  business model “disgusting.”  Robinhood counters that it is “democratizing” Wall Street by creating an easily accessible trading platform that allows investors to engage in fractional trading, buying small percentages of stock shares.  “There is an old guard that doesn’t want average Americans to have a seat at the Wall Street table so they will resort to insults,” the company said in a statement last year.  “Adversaries of this future and of change are usually those who’ve enjoyed plentiful privileges in the past and who don’t want these privileges disrupted,” Robinhood added, saying that the “new generation of investors aren’t a ‘casino group.’” Either way, Robinhood may have other troubles ahead.  Robinhood announced on Tuesday that it will lay off about 23% of its staff following a sharp decline in trading activity on the platform. This is the second round of layoffs this year and part of a broader reorganization effort led by CEO Vlad Tenev."",",Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Robert Bartlett;Charlie Munger,University Of California;University Of California;Columbia Law School;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Financial Industry Regulatory Authority;Cnn;Cornell University,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,1030;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1981;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1981;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,1981;WB_2945_DATABASE,1981;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1981;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2438;KILL,1314;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,892;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2503;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,892;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2503;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1394;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,3521;SCIENCE,1182;SCIENCE,1613;TAX_FNCACT_GUARD,3486;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,1405;WB_698_TRADE,378;WB_698_TRADE,537;WB_698_TRADE,950;WB_698_TRADE,1138;WB_698_TRADE,1217;WB_698_TRADE,1820;WB_698_TRADE,2074;WB_698_TRADE,2327;WB_698_TRADE,3355;WB_698_TRADE,3418;WB_698_TRADE,4040;EDUCATION,270;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,2169;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATORS,2306;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,4165;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,830;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,913;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2456;TAX_FNCACT_RIGHTHAND_MAN,3161;LEGISLATION,885;LEGISLATION,2510;EPU_POLICY_LAW,885;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2510;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSORS,816;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,3161;WB_290_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_ORGANIZATIONAL_DESIGN,3245;WB_288_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_SECTOR_POLICY_AND_REGULATION,3245;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,3245;",California;Berkeley;Americans
13,https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/25/world/europe/uk-terror-arrests/,"""articleBody"":""Nine men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, London’s Metropolitan Police said Thursday. The men, ages 22 to 51, were detained Thursday morning in London on suspicion of being members of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism. They were taken to police stations in central London and remain in custody, a police statement said. Eighteen homes, business premises and community buildings across London are being searched as part of the investigation. Officers are also searching a home in Stoke on Trent in the English Midlands. “These arrests and searches are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist related terrorism and are not in response to any immediate public safety risk,” said the Met Police statement. Police did not give the identities of those arrested nor name the banned organization concerned. But the UK’s Press Association news agency cited sources as saying radical British cleric Anjem Choudary was among those arrested. Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN last month that the world had been split into two camps. There’s a “camp which believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to God. They are the Islamic State, at the head of which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” Choudary said. “In the other camp you have those people who believe sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man. At the head of that camp is Barack Obama.” “I believe this Islamic State will spread, rapidly, and I believe it will be in Europe and even America within decades.” Cameron lays out plans to counter UK jihadi threat Parliament recalled UK Prime Minister David Cameron called Wednesday for Parliament to be recalled Friday to debate the nation’s response to a request from the Iraqi government for airstrikes to support operations against ISIS in Iraq. Speaking in New York, where he’s attending the U.N. General Assembly, Cameron said he was convinced that ISIS is “a direct threat” to Britain and that the nation should join international efforts against the group in Iraq. “What we are doing is legal, it is right, it does not involve British combat troops on the ground. But as ever with our country when we are threatened in this way, we should not turn away from what needs to be done,” he said. “I am confident we will get this through Parliament on an all party basis, and I think it is right for our country to be united at this time.”  Any action against ISIS in Syria would require a separate parliamentary debate and vote, he said.  Terror threat level raised The Home Office has listed 60 international proscribed terrorist organizations as of August 2014.  They include networks such as ISIS and al Qaeda, as well as UK-based groups such as Al Muhajiroun, which emerged in 1996 and has operated under a range of other names since being disbanded in 2004. The UK Home Office last month raised its terror threat level from “substantial” to “severe.”  The government also announced new measures to combat the threat from Islamist extremism, including a radical new measure to ban Britons from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups.

315,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/asia/extreme-heat-migrant-workers-climate-intl-hnk-dst/,"""articleBody"":""It was mid-afternoon on a sweltering Saturday when Raj, a laborer from northwest India, started feeling dizzy as he hauled heavy bags of concrete mix and sand on a construction site in downtown Singapore.  Temperatures had reached 34 degrees Celsius (94 degrees Fahrenheit), but Raj carried on despite the heat and soon developed a splitting headache. Within minutes, he collapsed to his knees and vomited.  “I felt very weak,” Raj said. “My head was spinning and my legs (gave way).”   The 32-year-old father of two is among millions of migrant laborers in Asia working on construction sites, shipyards, mines, factories, farms and plantations, who experts say are left vulnerable due to their prolonged outdoor exposure to high heat and humidity. “The heat scares me,” said Raj, who is being identified by only his first name because he fears repercussions from his company as well as the Singapore authorities for speaking about his working conditions.  “I have no choice. I have to work to support my family.”  For years, scientists warned that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. Now, many parts of the world are experiencing dangerous levels of heat – with little relief in sight.  Countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France and China recently issued extreme heat alerts and scientists predict even higher temperatures to come. “It’s been troubling to see events unfold the way science has predicted,” said Radhika Khosla, an associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment. “We are seeing fewer trees and more built up concrete areas that result in higher rates of heat stress, especially in vulnerable communities. “We’ve clearly not listened and adapted.”  Few places to escape the heat During recent heat waves, governments and global bodies like the United Nations advised people to remain indoors and switch on air conditioning to prevent heat-related illnesses. But that advice is all but impossible for migrant laborers and other workers who lack access to cooling technology. “Migrant workers are too often excluded and forgotten from most global conversations about the climate crisis even though they are clearly one of the most vulnerable groups at risk,” said British researcher and migrant worker rights specialist Andy Hall.  Hall highlighted concerns shared by many migrant workers on construction sites in countries like Singapore and Malaysia, who said that they were still being made to work outdoors despite extreme heat. They said they were not permitted to enter most air-conditioned public spaces like shopping malls and other buildings because of rules by landlords and tenants prohibiting their entry and to avoid complaints being made by members of the public, Hall said. Instead, they escape the heat by resting in parks or under trees, bridges and highways, he added. “They are unable to benefit from these (cool air solutions) due to systemic restrictions as well as discrimination. It’s disappointing,” Hall said. “Their welfare in the ongoing heat crisis needs to be a bigger topic of discussion.”  Prolonged heat exposure is also a problem in other Asian countries like India, which saw crop yields significantly reduced in May due to heat stress faced by farmers and workers, and Thailand – where activists say sugarcane cutters reported severe heat exhaustion in April from working long periods in the fields. Ahnaf, a laborer from Bangladesh, said he endures grueling 12-hour work days on an oil palm plantation in southern Malaysia, followed by hot, sleepless nights in an overcrowded and poorly ventilated dormitory room he shares with seven other men.  Like Raj, he is using only one name because he fears potential repercussions from his employer and the Malaysian government for complaining about his working conditions. “Working all day is tiring but it’s also hard to sleep and rest at night when it is so crowded and hot,” he said.  Jason Lee Kai Wei from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS) said that the lack of access to convenient cooling systems like air conditioning was “a matter of life and death” for many migrant workers. “If their working and living conditions do not improve, they could end up paying a high price with their lives,” he said.   Lee, also director at the NUS Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, said there were “solutions at hand,” on the part of companies that employ migrant laborers, like enforcing proper breaks during the hottest time of the day to protect workers’ health and safety. “But at the end of the day, employers must be convinced that the health and productivity (of migrant workers) can be achieved in tandem – not one or the other,” he said. “The problem is many of these work sites do not offer these solutions to workers.”   Leading Singaporean migrant worker rights activist Jolovan Wham said that the government had not imposed “stop work orders”  for migrant workers during the recent hot spell. “So companies can still insist that their workers continue even when temperatures are higher than normal,” Wham said.   Heat has always been an issue for migrant laborers, as well as domestic workers, in the city-state, he added. “They will not speak up about the terrible living and working conditions due to the heat because they are afraid,” he said.  “They carry on because at the end of the day, their jobs are too important and they can’t afford to lose work.”  Li, the owner of a construction company in Singapore, told CNN that many of his migrant workers were “severely affected” by the heat. He said they were given appropriate rest breaks but were still bound by other official protocols such as wearing heavy safety gear like helmets and thick rubber boots that trap huge amounts of heat. “It all adds up,” said Li, who didn’t want his full name published for fear of government repercussions. “The heat isn’t dying down or going away and that affects overall productivity – but we still have building projects to complete,” he said.   In an official report addressing work place heat stress, Singapore’s Manpower Ministry recommended measures including acclimatising workers to the local weather by adjusting workloads and monitoring workers for early signs of heat stress. “Working in Singapore’s hot and humid weather puts workers at an increased risk of heat injuries,” the ministry said in the report. “Employers have a duty to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, necessary measures to ensure that the work environment is safe and without risk to their employees’ safety and health.”  A spokesperson for the ministry told CNN that companies employing migrant workers are required to make provisions during periods of excessive heat and would be “subjected to enforcement actions under the Workplace Safety and Health Act if they failed to comply.”   Cooling gap between rich and poor As the climate crisis causes global temperatures to increase, the gap between rich and poorer nations is set to widen, according to a 2021 study by the Climate Impact Lab global research initiative.  “Richer populations can protect themselves from the impacts of warming but the global poor don’t have this luxury,” said Solomon Hsiang, a co-author of the paper. He added that access to air conditioning and electric fans would still remain “out of reach for more than half of the global population” in the coming decades.  In a strongly worded recent report that addressed extreme heat, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on governments to act to protect vulnerable people from “current and foreseeable harms of extreme heat.” “Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard (and) certain people are exposed to far more heat than others such as those often doing low-paying work outdoors or in hot kitchens and warehouses,” said HRW senior environment researcher Katharina Rall.  Scientists say increasing access to cooling technology for vulnerable people should be “immediate priorities” for governments around the world. “Air conditioned public spaces are go-to places during extreme heat,” said Winston Chow, an associate professor at the College of Integrative Studies at Singapore Management University. “Restricting access to cool spaces for vulnerable people like the elderly, disabled and migrant workers who spend a disproportionate amount of time outdoors working, would be the worst thing to do when heat waves are happening.”  Oxford professor Khosla pointed to the tremendous amounts of energy consumed by standard air conditioners and said that cooling technology needs to shift towards long-term sustainability. “Air conditioning is necessary given the rising levels of heat but it has to be much more energy efficient,” she said. She added that replacing air conditioning units with more eco-friendly models would be financially costly but consuming less electricity and reducing carbon footprints would go a long way in helping the environment.  “High energy efficiency models without damaging refrigerant gases that run on fossil fuel-free electricity sources are our best options,” she said. After suffering signs of heat stress, Raj said he was taken to a hospital in Singapore near the construction site where he worked.  He waited for about an hour in an air-conditioned room before being examined by a doctor and given a clean bill of health. “It was very nice and cold and I felt better,” he said. “The last time I had air conditioning was when I was on the plane to Singapore.”  “I work outdoors every day and there is no air conditioning in the dormitory. We have ceiling fans but they are (adjusted) to low speed so my friends and I rotate our sleeping arrangements so we can sleep under the fans,” he said.  “It’s not much, but at least it’s something.”"",",Jason Lee Kai Wei;Winston Chow;Katharina Rall;Radhika Khosla;Heather Chen;Andy Hall,Yong Loo Lin School Of Medicine;Performance Centre;United Nations;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Oxford University

600,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/muslim-men-file-discrimination-lawsuit-alaska-airlines-reaj/,"""articleBody"":""Two Muslim men have filed a federal discrimination suit against Alaska Airlines for being removed from a plane prior to takeoff after a passenger alerted the crew that the men were texting and speaking in Arabic. According to a complaint filed last week in federal district court, the plaintiffs, Abobakkr Dirar and Mohamed Elamin, allege they boarded a flight from Seattle to San Francisco on February 17, 2020, and after being seated in their first-class seats, they started speaking and texting in Arabic. Another passenger, who did not speak Arabic the complaint says, saw some of Dirar’s text messages and told the crew who removed Dirar and Elamin from the flight due to what they claimed to be a “ticket issue.”    Once Dirar and Elamin were off the flight, the men spoke with an Alaska Airlines manager who translated their text messages and the messages were deemed not to be a threat, but the men were subsequently surrounded by law enforcement, according to the complaint. Dirar and Elamin, the complaint says, felt humiliated for being taken off the plane and being surrounded by law enforcement while allowing other passengers to observe “humiliating Plaintiffs before their fellow passengers by unnecessarily deplaning said passengers and allowing them to observe Plaintiffs surrounded by uniformed law enforcement personnel.”   According to the complaint, they are seeking damages against the airline.  The pair was booked on subsequent flights separately to San Francisco, but Elamin had to sit in a downgraded seat and both passengers arrived at their destinations hours later than originally intended.  Dirar and Elamin’s attorney, Luis Segura, told CNN in a statement that Alaska Airlines could have handled the situation better after finding that the complaining passenger’s claims were baseless.   The airline “…could have acted responsibly by calming tensions, apologizing to our clients for their mistreatment, and allowing our clients to remain in their rightful seats, he said. “Instead, Alaska Airlines chose to pile onto the bigotry by using these two Black, Muslim American passengers as props in an admittedly unjustified, unnecessary, and self-serving display of security theater. By bringing this lawsuit, our clients not only seek justice for themselves, but also for an entire community tired of being scapegoated to justify discrimination in air travel.”   When asked why it took more than two years to file a lawsuit, Segura told CNN that in December of 2020, Alaska Airline’s counsel stated that they would be conducting an internal investigation into the matter but never reached back out to his clients. In a statement to CNN, Alaska Airlines says it takes discrimination complaints very seriously. “Our greatest responsibility is to ensure that our flight operations are safe every day, and that includes complying with federal regulations on investigating any passenger safety reports.  Since this case remains pending litigation, we’re unable to share any further comment or details at this time.” "",",Mohamed Elamin;Abobakkr Dirar;Luis Segura,Alaska Airline;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines,"TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,798;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2563;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2563;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2563;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2563;TAX_RELIGION_MUSLIM,13;TAX_RELIGION_MUSLIM,2095;TAX_ETHNICITY_MUSLIM,13;TAX_ETHNICITY_MUSLIM,2095;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2203;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2797;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2104;SOC_EXPRESSREGRET,1898;TRIAL,1652;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1652;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,939;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1093;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1311;JUSTICE,2277;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,2277;DISCRIMINATION,53;DISCRIMINATION,2374;DISCRIMINATION,2691;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,53;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2374;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2691;SECURITY_SERVICES,939;SECURITY_SERVICES,1093;SECURITY_SERVICES,1311;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,939;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1093;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1311;WB_840_JUSTICE,939;WB_840_JUSTICE,1093;WB_840_JUSTICE,1311;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,939;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1093;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1311;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,939;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1093;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1311;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,939;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1093;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1311;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,939;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1093;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1311;USPEC_POLICY1,2860;LEGISLATION,927;LEGISLATION,1081;LEGISLATION,1299;EPU_POLICY_LAW,927;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1081;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1299;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,212;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,504;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,550;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,879;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,2086;",Alaska;San Francisco;American
387,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/world/utah-ice-age-human-footprints-discovery-scn/,"""articleBody"":""Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Research on ancient footprints has previously challenged what’s known about when people arrived in North America, and a new discovery could shed more light on the story. Scientists have found 88 fossilized prints belonging to adults and children, likely dating back 12,000 years, in shallow riverbeds on the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. This is only the second set of human tracks from the Ice Age to be identified in what is now the United States.  Footprints record a specific type of evidence that most people cannot get from other types of archaeological or fossil records, said Kevin Hatala, paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was not involved in the discovery.  “You can understand how large these individuals were,” Hatala said. “You can understand how they were moving. When you see multiple trackways of footprints within the same site, you can start to understand how many people were likely there.” “Were they likely traveling together or were they moving in different ways?” he added. The fossils can offer important insight on present-day populations as well, said Daron Duke, principal investigator for the research and archaeologist for the Nevada-based Far Western Anthropological Research Group. “It also connects the people ancestral to the area to the finds,” he said. An inadvertent find The discovery occurred somewhat by accident, according to Duke and Tommy Urban, a research scientist at Cornell University in New York. Duke and Urban were searching Utah Test and Training Range in early July for remnants of purposeful prehistoric campfires, which were used by ancient humans as a source of light and heat. As they were driving around the Air Force base and talking about what fossilized footprints look like, Urban noticed one and the men stopped to inspect the print. After further examination, they identified dozens more in the area.  At first, they were unsure the footprints had been made by humans. But after several days evaluating the tracks’ size, shape and stride length, the researchers determined they were the work of barefoot human adults and children. While the archeologists are still working to confirm the age of the footprints via radiocarbon dating, they believe the tracks are 12,000 years old based on the previously dated sediment layer beneath them, and the fact that the prints were exposed to the surface around the same time as artifacts found to be 12,300 years old, Duke said. Additionally, the freshwater wetlands needed to preserve the prints have not existed in the area for at least 10,000 years.  In 2021, scientists used radiocarbon dating to find that 61 footprints discovered in 2020 in White Sands National Park in New Mexico – many belonging to teenagers and young children – were 21,000 to 23,000 years old. This would mean that humans inhabited North America during the Pleistocene era, or Ice Age, around 7,500 years earlier than previously thought. “Once I realized that (the Utah tracks) were barefoot human footprints, it was very exciting,” said Urban via email. “I had been working on footprints at White Sands for the previous five years, so it was astounding to think that we had just stumbled onto a second White Sands.” Going forward, the researchers need to preserve and protect the Utah prints and find out who the prints belonged to and when exactly they are from, Duke said. A distant human connection The find is an exciting one for the field of archaeological research, said David Madsen, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada-Reno. He was not involved in the discovery.  “Now that we have this human element, the story of the very early people becomes more real. There’s more funding available, there’s more interest in it, there’ll be more recovery,” Madsen said.  The location of the latest footprint discovery is near a site in northwestern Utah where researchers found numerous human artifacts in 2015, including stone tools and the earliest evidence of human tobacco use in the world. The relics date back to around the same time the prints were made. The proximity of the sites and the fact that the evidence is likely from the same time period tells archeologists a greater story about the people who may have inhabited the area during the Ice Age, Duke said.  Additionally, learning more about the prints may offer a better understanding of the Indigenous population in the western US.  There are 21 Indigenous communities in the region, and people from these communities are helping the researchers in the examination of the footprints.  “Their perspective, presence and understanding is invaluable,” said Anya Kitterman, the Air Force Base’s cultural resource manager, in a news release. “Our shared human history and stories are what truly unites us and it’s been an unbelievable experience to walk beside those who have gone before.”  "",",Anya Kitterman;David Madsen;Daron Duke;Kevin Hatala,Tommy;Anthropological Research Group;Us Air Force Utah Test;Cnn;Cornell University;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;University Of Nevada,"TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,4891;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,522;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2281;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3182;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3596;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3817;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4104;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4176;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4929;WB_1789_PHYSICAL_AND_CULTURAL_RESOURCES,4883;WB_901_ENVIRONMENTAL_SAFEGUARDS,4883;TAX_FNCACT_INVESTIGATOR,1318;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,451;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1887;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4854;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,542;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,3071;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4463;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,4188;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,4188;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,4188;WB_1439_TOBACCO_USE_AND_CONTROL,4188;URBAN,1593;URBAN,1681;URBAN,1959;URBAN,3229;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,1616;MILITARY,457;MILITARY,1893;MILITARY,4860;EDUCATION,804;EDUCATION,1638;EDUCATION,3733;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,804;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1638;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3733;TAX_FNCACT_ARCHAEOLOGIST,1351;TAX_FNCACT_ARCHAEOLOGIST,3715;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1233;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCIPAL,1305;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIR_FORCE_BASE,1898;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIR_FORCE_BASE,4865;TAX_ETHNICITY_INDIGENOUS,4579;TAX_ETHNICITY_INDIGENOUS,4635;ETH_INDIGINOUS,4579;ETH_INDIGINOUS,4635;SCIENCE,37;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,2880;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,2880;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,2880;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,1822;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,2143;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,3012;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2669;WB_594_WETLANDS,2669;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2669;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,386;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2299;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2947;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4998;",Pennsylvania;New Mexico;Utah;Chatham;United States;America;New York;White Sands;Cornell University

166,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/business/oil-prices-selloff/,"""articleBody"":""The selloff in the oil market gathered momentum Thursday on growing concerns about weakening demand for gasoline. US oil dropped 2.3% to $88.54 a barrel, the weakest settle since February 2. Brent crude, the world benchmark, fell around 3%. A government report released Wednesday unnerved oil traders by revealing an unexpected build in both crude oil and gasoline stockpiles, suggesting demand is cooling off. Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, noted that the weekly Energy Information Administration report showed a decline in refinery usage, rising gasoline inventories and a shrinking amount of gasoline supplied. “I can’t stress enough those three things are not supposed to happen in summer,” Yawger said. “It implies there is a bad demand situation out there.” The EIA report indicates that Americans are using less gasoline than they were during not just last summer (when prices were lower), but even during the summer of 2020 when Covid-19 was still restraining travel. The four-week moving average of gasoline supplied for the week ending July 29 stood at 8.6 million barrels per day, down about 9% from the same period of 2021 and slightly below the same period of 2020. the EIA said. Some people stopped driving as much when gasoline surged above $5 a gallon in mid-June. Since then, the national average for regular gas has declined 51 days in a row, dropping to $4.14 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. That is down 14 cents in the past week and 67 cents in the past month.  Oil prices have tumbled by 28% since their recent closing high of $123.70 on March 8 in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."",",Robert Yawger,Energy Information Administration,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,262;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,262;ECON_OILPRICE,207;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1080;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1669;TAX_FNCACT_INSIDER,434;TAX_FNCACT_INSIDER,500;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,584;ENV_OIL,35;ENV_OIL,135;ENV_OIL,301;ENV_OIL,360;ENV_OIL,1662;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1001;LEADER,584;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,584;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,584;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,620;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1756;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,725;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,725;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,725;WB_2298_REFINERIES,725;TAX_FNCACT_TRADERS,309;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1137;",Mizuho;Americans;Ukraine;Russia;New York
686,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/economy/inflation-reduction-bill-corporate-profits/,"""articleBody"":""Even as some business groups cry foul over the tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, economists at Goldman Sachs say the landmark bill will barely put a dent in massive corporate profits. To pay for historic climate investments, the legislation that passed the Senate on Sunday imposes a 15% minimum corporate tax and a 1% tax on stock buybacks. But the fallout from these tax provisions will be minimal, according to Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS). The buyback tax and minimum corporate tax will lower per-share profits next year among S&P 500 companies by just 1.5%, according to a Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) analysis published early Sunday. Companies that pay low effective tax rates – such as health care and technology firms – would see a bigger hit, the bank said. Overall, Goldman Sachs said the net fiscal impact of the Inflation Reduction Act “look very modest,” translating to less than 0.1% of GDP over the next several years. That’s because the new spending and new taxes “roughly offset,” the bank said. Citigroup\n            \n                (C) echoed that sentiment, saying the minimum tax and buyback components of the legislation will have a “minimal impact” on S&P 500 profits. Citi’s early read, the bank said, is that the 15% minimum tax will negatively impact consensus earnings estimates by just 0.42% for 2023 — and even that estimate might “overstate” the impact. CEOs weigh in The findings stand in contrast with warnings from some major business trade groups that have argued the new tax provisions will backfire. The Business Roundtable, an influential CEO lobby, said in a statement on Saturday that while it supports policies in the bill to incentivize clean energy, the minimum corporate tax would suppress domestic investment and “undermine the competitiveness of America’s exporters.” “Imposing more than $300 billion in tax increases during a downturn is the wrong policy at the wrong time,” Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the statement, noting that the US economy has faced two consecutive quarters of declining GDP and “remains at risk of a protracted economic decline.” The American Petroleum Institute, the biggest oil and gas trade group, said over the weekend it is “encouraged” by the bill’s extension and expansion of carbon capture tax credits and provisions on onshore and offshore lease sales. However, the API said much-needed permitting reform is “glaringly absent” from the bill, and criticized its tax provisions. “We remain opposed to policies that raise taxes and discourage investments in US oil and natural gas,” said API CEO Mike Sommers."",",Mike Sommers;Joshua Bolten,Senate On;Goldman Sachs;Goldman Sachs;Goldman Sachs;Goldman Sachs;American Petroleum Institute,"ENV_CARBONCAPTURE,2230;TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMISTS,115;ECON_INFLATION,88;ECON_INFLATION,828;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,88;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,828;WB_442_INFLATION,88;WB_442_INFLATION,828;ECON_TAXATION,60;ECON_TAXATION,335;ECON_TAXATION,345;ECON_TAXATION,395;ECON_TAXATION,472;ECON_TAXATION,496;ECON_TAXATION,673;ECON_TAXATION,1070;ECON_TAXATION,1218;ECON_TAXATION,1476;ECON_TAXATION,1689;ECON_TAXATION,1810;ECON_TAXATION,2234;ECON_TAXATION,2401;USPEC_POLICY1,60;USPEC_POLICY1,335;USPEC_POLICY1,345;USPEC_POLICY1,395;USPEC_POLICY1,472;USPEC_POLICY1,496;USPEC_POLICY1,673;USPEC_POLICY1,1070;USPEC_POLICY1,1218;USPEC_POLICY1,1476;USPEC_POLICY1,1689;USPEC_POLICY1,1810;USPEC_POLICY1,2234;USPEC_POLICY1,2401;EPU_POLICY_TAX,60;EPU_POLICY_TAX,335;EPU_POLICY_TAX,345;EPU_POLICY_TAX,395;EPU_POLICY_TAX,472;EPU_POLICY_TAX,496;EPU_POLICY_TAX,673;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1070;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1218;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1476;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1689;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1810;EPU_POLICY_TAX,2234;EPU_POLICY_TAX,2401;EPU_CATS_TAXES,60;EPU_CATS_TAXES,335;EPU_CATS_TAXES,345;EPU_CATS_TAXES,395;EPU_CATS_TAXES,472;EPU_CATS_TAXES,496;EPU_CATS_TAXES,673;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1070;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1218;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1476;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1689;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1810;EPU_CATS_TAXES,2234;EPU_CATS_TAXES,2401;ENV_OIL,2122;ENV_OIL,2497;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,1654;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,1654;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1654;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1654;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2433;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1858;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,237;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2084;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,2036;ECON_STOCKMARKET,354;GENERAL_HEALTH,694;MEDICAL,694;LEGISLATION,267;LEGISLATION,1110;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,267;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1110;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,267;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,1110;ENV_NATURALGAS,2511;WB_368_LEASING,2283;EPU_ECONOMY,1968;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,34;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1434;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1517;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1887;WB_1847_CLIMATE_FINANCE,249;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,249;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,953;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1549;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1902;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2526;WB_698_TRADE,1440;WB_698_TRADE,2134;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,699;EPU_POLICY_REFORM,2344;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2242;WB_382_TAX_CREDITS_AND_DIRECT_SUBSIDIES,2242;WB_376_INNOVATION_TECHNOLOGY_AND_ENTREPRENEURSHIP,2242;WB_377_FIRM_INNOVATION_PRODUCTIVITY_AND_GROWTH,2242;WB_380_FUNDING_INNOVATION,2242;",America;American;New York

Miller is accused of stealing alcohol in May from a Vermont home while the owners were away, according to state law enforcement.  Vermont State Police found probable cause to charge the actor with felony burglary into an unoccupied dwelling in the town of Stamford, according to a news release from police.   After being alerted to a possible burglary on May 1, police found that several bottles of alcohol had been taken from the residence, the release said. Surveillance footage and statements gave police probable cause to charge Miller, according to the release, but it gave no details.  The actor, who previously appeared as The Flash in multiple DC superhero films, was issued a citation on Sunday, according to state police spokesperson Adam Silverman.  Miller is ordered to appear in Vermont Superior Court on September 26 for an arraignment on the burglary charge, the release said.   CNN reached out to Miller’s representatives for comment but has not heard back.   The actor is starring in an upcoming “The Flash” film, which is a DC Films production. DC Films is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, which is also CNN’s parent company.  In March, Miller was arrested in Hilo, Hawaii, and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment following an incident in a bar, according to police. On April 19, the actor pleaded no contest and was fined $500 for the disorderly conduct charge, a court record shows. The harassment charge was dismissed. Correction: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong name of the company behind “The Flash.” It is a DC Films production.

Arkansas County Northern District Judge Jeremiah Bueker, 48, was in Jefferson County for “recreational travel” with his loved ones, but at some point during the trip he “ventured off alone” and was not seen alive again, according to a Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office news release. His death is being investigated as an accidental drowning, the office said. Bueker was last seen near Mud Lake, where his body was later found, the sheriff’s office reported. “After time had passed and no one had seen or heard from Bueker, worry began to set in,” the release said. “A search for Bueker by family and friends began.” After the sun set, the family had still not found Bueker, so they called 911, the release said. An extensive ground and water search was conducted late into the night and early morning by the sheriff’s office and wildlife officers with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Eventually, the search had to be paused due to low visibility, the sheriff’s office said.  On Sunday morning, the search resumed as authorities scoured the lake using boats with side-scan sonar, which allowed them to get “a birds-eye view of the water,” Sheriff Lafayette Woods Jr. said in the release. “At approximately 9:16 a.m., the side-scan sonar revealed a body on the bottom of the lake,” and deputies pulled the body from the water, the sheriff’s office said. The family helped authorities identify the recovered body as Bueker’s and an autopsy will be performed by the State Medical Examiner, the sheriff’s office said.  “I truly pray that the successful recovery of Judge Bueker’s body by our deputies and Arkansas Game and Fish Wildlife Officers brings some sense of closure to the Bueker family and those who knew him best,” Woods said. CNN has reached out to the Stuttgart District Court, where Bueker served as district judge. April Davis, the deputy coroner for Jefferson County who responded to the scene, said there were no signs of foul play. She noted the body was intact with no signs of trauma. According to Davis, a State Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy is standard procedure. The body was transported to the office on Sunday and the autopsy is expected to be performed this week, with a report expected in about three to six months, she said. Mud Lake is in Jefferson County and lies about 75 miles southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas. Correction: An earlier version of this story, along with a map, gave the wrong location for Mud Lake. It is in Jefferson County, Arkansas. CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.

504,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/muriel-bowser-dc-national-guard-request-denied-migrants/,"""articleBody"":""The Pentagon has declined Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for aid from the DC National Guard to help with migrants entering the city by bus, according to a US defense official.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin rejected the request because the Department of Defense has “determined providing this support would negatively impact the readiness of the DCNG and have negative effects on the organization and members,” the official said. The official said grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program is sufficient. “We understand SAMU First Response has received grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program and has indicated that sufficient EFSP funds exist at this point to provide migrant assistance.” Bowser told reporters on Friday that she wants to continue to work with the Pentagon to ensure political considerations “are not a part of their decision.” The Democrat, who has served as the District’s mayor under US presidents of both parties, alluded to the use of the National Guard during the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol: “Having the experience where the use of the DC National Guard was politicized, that puts the District in unsafe territory,” she told reporters Friday. “We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs, and to assure that any political considerations are not a part of their decision,” she added. In a letter from the Department of Defense, Bowser said the Pentagon highlighted “the concern about the open-ended nature of our request, and their ability to respond to it.” “So having just looked at their letter, they appear to say a more specified request would help them understand our needs,” Bowser added. According to the office of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, more than 6,500 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 160 buses.  The city has facilitated the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a $1 million grant, the mayor said at a news conference last week. However, city officials and non-government organizations have been increasingly concerned about the pace of arrivals over recent weeks. The mayor’s office requested to convert the DC Armory, Joint Base Bolling, Fort McNair or other “suitable federal location in the National Capital Region” into a processing center for the migrants. The regional welcome center established to aid the migrants in Montgomery County, Maryland, is at capacity, according to the request. “I’ve asked for the deployment of the Guard as long as we need the Guard to deal with the crisis that we expect to escalate,” Bowser said last week. “The number of people crossing the border seeking asylum we expect to only go up. And we need to make sure that there is a national response, not an ad-hoc, city by city, state by state response.” Bowser also highlighted the differences in the situation in DC compared to other states.  “We need to ask the President for the use of our National Guard, which we know can be very helpful in these logistical matters,” she said at the time.

566,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/entertainment/i-just-killed-my-dad-review/,"""articleBody"":""As titles not to watch with the kids go, “I Just Killed My Dad” has to rank pretty high on the list. Yet there are enough twists in Netflix’s latest true-crime docuseries to keep audiences engaged, with another sensational case that’s more of a whydunit – given the killer’s immediate confession – than who. The phrase in the title was uttered in 2019 by then-17-year-old Anthony Templet, who had just shot his father in their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Over three episodes, director Skye Borgman (also responsible for Netflix’s “Girl In The Picture”) teases out the events that preceded those actions, including allegations of abuse and child abduction, as well as the decision by Anthony’s father, Burt, to home school him and demand that he know the boy’s whereabouts at all times. “I Just Killed My Dad” thus gradually peels back layers on this sordid saga – “sordid” being the operative word for almost everything that Netflix does in the true-crime space, including its recent entries “The Most Hated Man on the Internet” and “Our Father.” What makes it all vaguely chilling is Anthony’s numb, unemotional response – seemingly convinced he hasn’t done anything wrong – and his overall manner, which indicates that not all has been right within the home. After the initial flurry of twists, the tale does bog down in the middle, giving way to Anthony’s lawyer and the prosecutor in the case trying to find a path that feels like justice given all the extenuating circumstances. As the latter notes, there’s understandable concern about appearing to sanction murder, and how letting the boy go might be perceived. (The case was resolved in 2021, but not knowing how adds to the viewing experience.) Frankly, “I Just Killed My Dad” seems to exist largely because of that attention-getting title, which weds old-fashioned exploitation movies with the fare normally found on channels like Investigation Discovery. Netflix has gone a bit overboard with these kind of docuseries in terms of sheer volume, but to be fair, so has everyone else. Moreover, these projects reliably light up social media for a lot less money than going out and hiring an all-star cast. While something like “I Just Killed My Dad” might not be the kind of material that’s fun for the whole family, it’s the sort of formula that usually ensures a trip right to the top of the service’s most-watched tier. “I Just Killed My Dad” premieres Aug. 9 on Netflix.

562,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/eastern-kentucky-floods-mutual-aid-cec/,"""articleBody"":""Kayla Slone hops out of the bed of her husband’s pickup truck as it stops in front of what used to be a house. A friend hands her a couple of Styrofoam takeout containers from the stacks that fill the truck, and Slone makes her way toward an elderly couple sitting outside a shed. This is all that’s left of their home after the recent floods in eastern Kentucky that left at least 37 people dead. “Ya hungry?” she calls out cheerfully. The couple is pleased to see her again. Slone has become a familiar face over the last few days, delivering scores of home-cooked meals to people in the remote reaches of Knott County. On the menu today: Sloppy Joes and corn salad. As Slone hands over the food, she notices a disassembled bed frame and mattress sitting out front. She asks if they need it put together – her husband and a friend who are out with her today have the muscles for the job, she jokes – but the couple tells her not to worry.  She also mentions that she’s working on getting them an air-conditioning unit – she suspects the couple has been sleeping in the shed, and temperatures have been unbearably hot. “Everybody’s come together and just done what we have to do to support each other,” she tells CNN. “That’s just what we do.” Slone, a hairdresser whose home in nearby Littcarr was spared from the worst of the floods, says she’s fortunate that she can afford to take time off to care for more vulnerable members of her community. Many people in eastern Kentucky were already struggling when disaster struck, and the needs right now are vast and urgent. In a region long derided and dismissed by outsiders, Slone and others in eastern Kentucky know their neighbors can’t count on support to come from elsewhere. So they’re doing what they’ve always done: Helping one another survive. People here were already struggling The homes and livelihoods wiped away by the flooding were already on shaky ground. After cycles of boom and bust over the last century, eastern Kentucky’s coal industry has declined steeply since the ’80s as companies laid off workers in favor of automation and mechanization. As demand for alternative energy sources increased and coal became less profitable to mine, many of the region’s workers were out of a job.  The miners who were still employed were prescribed opiates for pain from their injuries, a phenomenon that helped give rise to the ongoing opioid epidemic. After decades of disinvestment in the region, parts of eastern Kentucky are experiencing an exodus. Knott County and Letcher County, two of the areas hit hardest by the floods, saw their populations decline by about 12% each between 2010 and 2020, according to data from the US Census Bureau. Poverty rates in counties across the region are more than twice the national average, and unemployment rates are similarly grim. Those conditions translate to a shrinking tax base, providing local governments little funding to improve infrastructure. The beautiful, rugged landscape, a point of pride for the region, also presents challenges. Eastern Kentucky is made up of hills and “hollers,” or narrow valleys cut by streams. But the steep slopes are prone to landslides, leaving the valleys vulnerable to flash flooding. Building in the hills could mitigate flood risks, but doing so is extremely costly, says Bill Haneberg. “People have really very little choice except to live in floodplain areas,” adds Haneberg, state geologist and director of the Kentucky Geological Survey at the University of Kentucky. When historic levels of rain began to fall in late July, the creeks along the valleys turned into raging rivers, knocking already fragile homes off their foundations. The floodwaters washed away dirt roads and small bridges, and some lost their vehicles. Many were left stranded. As a warming planet threatens to make extreme weather events like this more common, there are concerns about how decades of coal mining and fossil fuel extraction have altered the region’s landscape.  “It’s likely we would have had extremely severe flooding even if there had never been a coal mine in eastern Kentucky,” Haneberg says. “The question that we don’t know the answer to is: How much might this amount of disturbance have increased the severity of the current floods?” One county formed an aid network These circumstances are part of why Slone feels so compelled to be there for her neighbors. After a few days of cooking and delivering meals with the help of her mother and sister, she realized there were people in the community who weren’t being reached. So she enlisted some friends with off-road vehicles to go into the hollers where their truck can’t. They travel deep into these remote communities to deliver meals and cleaning supplies, asking the residents they encounter how many more houses are past them. If they have to get out of the vehicle to climb their way there, they do. “A lot of people are stuck,” Slone says. “And there’s a lot of people that people don’t know that are stuck. We find people every day.” Slone funded the first day of meals herself, then called for donations to keep the work going. She says she received about $800 initially, and money kept rolling in. Soon, she was getting requests for items besides food – one person needed a propane tank so their generator could keep running their medical device, another needed to borrow a side-by-side for the day. What started as a small operation kept expanding. Another community member involved in aid efforts across Knott County reached out and asked if Slone would be willing to take the lead on addressing needs that arise in the communities of Pine Top and Caney. Slone is now part of a team of volunteers that spans the county. Group members communicate using the walkie-talkie app Voxer, and voice messages come into the chat titled “Knott Flood” all day. While on her route in Pine Top, Slone opens the app: A man wants to know if anyone has a trailer that can be used to haul a church parking lot’s worth of supplies. Slone responds that her husband has one that he might be able to borrow. In another voice message, she mentions that she’s trying to procure two AC units for residents in need. Specific requests are also coming in for her designated areas, whether someone needs diapers or toothpaste. “Even if I can’t get to it, I make sure it gets done,” Slone says.  A mutual aid group gives out cash Others throughout the region are showing up in similar ways. EKY Mutual Aid, a Facebook group that started in 2020 to help people through the pandemic, is one example. Like other mutual aid networks across the country, it’s a community of people working together to address each other’s needs – neighbors helping neighbors without a top-down leadership structure.  People post to the group about what they need – one man whose house was flooded needs money to pay for the motel where he and his kids are sleeping, another feels overwhelmed as he cares for elderly relatives and just needs someone to talk to. Other members of the group offer support as they are able. The idea is solidarity, not charity, says one of the group’s administrators Misty Skaggs. Over the last two years, EKY Mutual Aid grew from about 60 to 4,000 members, with at least half participating regularly, Skaggs says. A week-and-a-half after the floods hit, the group now exceeds 5,000 members. The numbers are relatively large for a rural region with such a small population, and Skaggs credits the community’s strength to Appalachia’s culture and history. “When you’re struggling, you learn to struggle together a little better,” she says. Community members are also giving out what many need most urgently: Money. At a makeshift supply center in downtown Whitesburg, Jessica Shelton is discussing the challenges her community is up against when a woman walks in the door. “Are you guys still handing out $200?” the woman asks. “I’ve got someone here that could use it.” Shelton, who is organizing mutual aid efforts in Whitesburg and also works closely with EKY Mutual Aid, directs her to someone who can help. The woman walks out with the funds, no questions asked.  “Giving them $200 is just saying, ‘You are worth something and you deserve this. I’m not going to ask you what you’re doing with that money, but I know you need it,’” says Shelton, who is also director of the Appalachian Media Institute at the nonprofit cultural arts organization Appalshop. She says she’s personally received about $25,000 in donations to help flooding victims, nearly $10,000 of which has been distributed as direct aid. But she stresses that she’s not alone in this work – communities all over eastern Kentucky are lifting each other up. “I know there’s people out there helping their neighbor muck out their house or lending them whatever they can,” Shelton says. “Truly everyone is doing mutual aid, whether they’re calling it that or not.” Locals feel they’ve long been overlooked In eastern Kentucky, caring for one’s neighbors isn’t just a benevolent gesture – it’s survival. “One thing that we realized over the course of mutual aid is most people around here are of the mindset that the government and these institutions that we’re supposed to rely on really don’t care if poor people live or die,” says Skaggs. “And I believe that.” That feeling of neglect runs deep in the region, resurfacing in the aftermath of the floods. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited on Monday, along with Gov. Andy Beshear and the state’s first lady Britainy Beshear. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have been in the region surveying the damage, and the agency has announced that uninsured or underinsured people in 12 counties can apply for disaster assistance. Meanwhile, Beshear said in an August 3 news conference that the state had collected more than $3 million in donations to assist those affected by the floods, and that the state legislature was considering a special session to discuss relief. But such assistance could take time to get approved, if it gets approved at all. And for some in eastern Kentucky, these announcements are just a drop in the bucket for what’s truly needed to address the challenges facing the region. “We had a housing crisis before this flood. We’ve had environmental crises before this flood,” Shelton says. “No one that has any power to do anything has been doing anything about it – no matter how much we scream about it.” Others, like fourth-generation Fleming-Neon resident Sam Quillen, are skeptical, too. He would have liked to see some kind of federal presence sooner, and he’s unsure whether the funding that will ultimately be approved will be enough for his town to recover. “We’re kind of on the end of the spectrum of getting anything,” he says. “And that’s the way we’ve always been treated. We don’t have enough population to warrant enough clout.” Barely a week after the disaster, Quillen and others say it feels like national attention is already fading.  But many are committed to staying As Crystal Watson surveys what’s left of the Isom Vendors Mall and Flea Market, she wonders how her business – and the region – will recover. People came to the indoor antique mall in Letcher County from surrounding counties to score discounted appliances, furniture and other items. With few other economic opportunities in the area, the market that she and her husband owned for seven years also kept many of her vendors afloat.  The floods wiped out thousands of dollars in inventory, as well as entire livelihoods, Watson says. A 96-year-old woman at the market worked here for extra income, while a couple in between jobs relied on it to make ends meet.  Watson, her staff members and some friends have been working since last week to remove the mud that cakes the floor. While the destruction of the place where she spent so many of her waking hours is hard to stomach, she knows many people have it much worse. So she’s doing her best to reopen. “This is a needed thing for this area, because people can’t afford new,” Watson says. “Everybody’s on fixed incomes or they’re elderly. They need this stuff.” Others are coming to a different conclusion. In Quillen’s town of Fleming-Neon, a few elderly business owners have already told him that they don’t plan on reopening. Rebuilding will take time and money that they don’t have, and they’re better off relocating. But plenty see the potential in eastern Kentucky, and are pushing for a better future. Years ago, Slone moved for a time to Morgantown, West Virginia. It wasn’t home, though, and she soon returned. “I missed the ‘What are you putting in your pot roast?’ in the grocery store, and ‘How’s your mom?’” she says. “This is where you want to be when something happens.” Slone doesn’t know how long she’ll be cooking meals and delivering supplies to her neighbors. But as long as there’s a need, she says she’ll be out there – showing up for the people who make this beautiful, complicated region worth it."",",Britainy Beshear;Jill Biden;Maris Hovee;Jessica

189,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-parliament-visit/,"""articleBody"":""During a historic trip to Taiwan Wednesday, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her visit was intended to make it “unequivocally clear” that the United States would “not abandon” the democratically governed island. China responded to Pelosi’s trip launching military exercises, which China’s Ministry of Defense said began on Wednesday with drills in both the seas and airspace surrounding Taiwan. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said 27 Chinese warplanes made incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and 22 planes crossed the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday – an unprecedented number since Taiwan began publicly releasing information about China’s air incursions about two years ago.  As the California Democrat departed the island on Wednesday afternoon for South Korea, there were already signs of the strains her visit to Taipei – the first by a sitting US House speaker in 25 years – had placed on Washington’s relationship with Beijing – which warned that her trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations.” China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has long vowed to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary.  Pelosi’s praise of the island’s commitment to democracy was a significant show of support for Taipei, coming just hours after China threatened to retaliate to her presence with a series of military exercises the Taiwanese Defense Ministry likened to a “maritime and aerial blockade.”  Beijing had repeatedly warned of dire consequences should the trip go ahead – even going as far as to warn US President Joe Biden that those who played with fire would “perish” by it. But the warnings from Beijing – and even a suggestion by Biden himself that the US military thought the trip was “not a good idea” – did not dissuade Pelosi, 82, from flying into the island alongside a congressional delegation on Tuesday evening and meeting its leading officials. “We are proud of our enduring friendship,” said Pelosi, speaking alongside Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen at the presidential office in Taipei the morning after her arrival.  “Now more than ever, America’s solidarity with Taiwan is crucial and that is the message we are bringing here today.”  In a statement released Wednesday after she left Taiwan, Pelosi said that her visit “should be seen as a strong statement that America stands with Taiwan.” China’s response Pelosi arrived to a largely warm welcome in Taipei, with the city’s tallest building, Taipei 101, lighting up with a welcome message and supporters gathering outside her hotel – though her visit to the legislature on Wednesday attracted a smattering of protesters. Video showed some people shouting, “Pelosi, get out” and holding placards reading, “Taiwan doesn’t want war.” President Tsai thanked Pelosi for visiting, praised her long commitment to democracy and human rights and bestowed on her Taiwan’s highest civilian honor. Beijing, within minutes of Pelosi’s arrival in Taipei, said it would immediately begin “a series of joint military operations around the island,” including using long-range live ammunition in the Taiwan Strait that separates the island from mainland China. China’s Ministry of Defense said the military exercises began on Wednesday, which it said involved the navy, air force and other military forces.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry described the military exercises as “irrational” and tantamount to a “blockade.” It said the planned drills would violate Taiwan’s territorial waters, “threaten an international waterway, challenge the international order, undermine the cross-strait status quo and endanger regional security.” The Chinese incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) were made by six J-11 fighter jets, five J-16 fighter jets, and 16 Su-30 fighter jets, the Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday night. China frequently sends warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ. The highest number of incursions ever recorded was on October 4 last year, when 56 military planes flew into the area on the same day.  On Wednesday, as Pelosi met with Taiwan’s leaders, elbow-bumping and posing for photos, China suspended the import of citrus fruits and some fish products from Taiwan, as well as the export of sand to the island.  Chinese Customs claimed the suspension of citrus fruit imports was a result of “pest control” and “excessive pesticide residues,” and cited “Covid prevention” for the suspension on seafood imports. However, its previous bans on some Taiwanese products have often coincided with periods of escalating tensions.  ‘Taiwan will not back down’ President Tsai, like Pelosi, appeared unmoved by China’s warnings. “Facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down,” Tsai said during a televised meeting with Pelosi. “We will firmly uphold our nation’s sovereignty and continue to hold the line of defense for democracy. At the same time, we wish to cooperate and work in unity with all democracies around the world to jointly safeguard democratic values.” Taiwan would do “whatever it takes” to strengthen its defensive capabilities, Tsai added, saying she was committed to “maintaining peace and stability” in the Taiwan Strait and vowing to make Taiwan a “key stabilizing force” for regional security and the development of global trade. Pelosi told reporters Wednesday that “America stands with Taiwan” and China will “not stand in the way” of people coming to visit the island.  “We have to show the world, and that is one of the purposes of our trip, to show the world the success of the people of Taiwan,” she said. “We want Taiwan to always have freedom with security and we’re not backing away from that.” She also praised Taiwan as “one of the freest societies in the world.”  Pelosi and the US congressional delegation also met Taiwanese lawmakers, exchanging pleasantries with Taiwan’s Deputy Speaker Tsai Chi-chang before a closed-doors meeting.  Pelosi is a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has denounced Beijing’s human rights record, and met pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters. More recently, she has voiced support for the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. On Wednesday, Pelosi and the congressional delegation left the self-governed island around 6 p.m. (local), departing from Taiwan’s Songshan airport This story has been updated with additional developments.

510,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/muriel-bowser-dc-national-guard-request-denied-migrants/,"""articleBody"":""The Pentagon has declined Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for aid from the DC National Guard to help with migrants entering the city by bus, according to a US defense official.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin rejected the request because the Department of Defense has “determined providing this support would negatively impact the readiness of the DCNG and have negative effects on the organization and members,” the official said. The official said grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program is sufficient. “We understand SAMU First Response has received grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program and has indicated that sufficient EFSP funds exist at this point to provide migrant assistance.” Bowser told reporters on Friday that she wants to continue to work with the Pentagon to ensure political considerations “are not a part of their decision.” The Democrat, who has served as the District’s mayor under US presidents of both parties, alluded to the use of the National Guard during the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol: “Having the experience where the use of the DC National Guard was politicized, that puts the District in unsafe territory,” she told reporters Friday. “We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs, and to assure that any political considerations are not a part of their decision,” she added. In a letter from the Department of Defense, Bowser said the Pentagon highlighted “the concern about the open-ended nature of our request, and their ability to respond to it.” “So having just looked at their letter, they appear to say a more specified request would help them understand our needs,” Bowser added. According to the office of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, more than 6,500 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 160 buses.  The city has facilitated the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a $1 million grant, the mayor said at a news conference last week. However, city officials and non-government organizations have been increasingly concerned about the pace of arrivals over recent weeks. The mayor’s office requested to convert the DC Armory, Joint Base Bolling, Fort McNair or other “suitable federal location in the National Capital Region” into a processing center for the migrants. The regional welcome center established to aid the migrants in Montgomery County, Maryland, is at capacity, according to the request. “I’ve asked for the deployment of the Guard as long as we need the Guard to deal with the crisis that we expect to escalate,” Bowser said last week. “The number of people crossing the border seeking asylum we expect to only go up. And we need to make sure that there is a national response, not an ad-hoc, city by city, state by state response.” Bowser also highlighted the differences in the situation in DC compared to other states.  “We need to ask the President for the use of our National Guard, which we know can be very helpful in these logistical matters,” she said at the time.

58,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/what-is-vote-a-rama/,"""articleBody"":""Democrats’ push to advance their energy and health care bill is likely headed for a procedural speed bump known in Washington as a “vote-a-rama.”  The time-consuming and stamina-challenging process is among the final obstacles for Democrats, along with the Senate parliamentarian’s review of the package. Politically, a vote-a-rama gives Republicans a chance to sow discord and create distractions as they force Democrats to vote on controversial issues. But, once it’s over, Democrats have the opportunity to advance their package on a straight party-line vote that would not be subject to the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold. Here’s what you need to know: What is a vote-a-rama? Usually in the legislative process, lawmakers can use a series of procedural maneuvers to avoid voting on amendments. But in a budget reconciliation process – which Democrats are using to advance their bill – you can’t do that. Lawmakers cannot hold a final vote on a reconciliation bill until all the amendments have been “disposed of,” or in simpler terms, “voted on.” The practice involves votes on a series of amendments that can – and usually do – stretch for hours. How do lawmakers use the process? The party in charge typically wants to move this vote-a-rama along as quickly as possible with as few votes as possible. The minority party takes the opportunity to force votes on all kinds of measures they don’t typically have the power to put on the floor. How long does each vote take? Usually, lawmakers agree to a process that looks a lot like this. Each amendment takes about 15 minutes or so to get through. The process moves quickly by Senate standards, which is why it is so important for members to basically stay in or close by the chamber for the entire marathon event. What’s in the bill? The bill contains a number of Democrats’ goals, including some provisions that party leaders have worked toward for years: Still, this isn’t Build Back Better 2.0. The package is less than half the size of Biden’s original social safety net plan, and a number of key Democratic priorities are likely to be left out.

474,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/lindhurst-high-school-shooting-cec/,"""articleBody"":""Angela Welch still recalls every detail. The stocky gunman in a camo ​vest. The gunshots, one after another. The piercing screams, echoing through the building. The muffled sobs.  Welch was a high school sophomore in Olivehurst, California, when a former student entered her school on a Friday afternoon with a 12-gauge shotgun in one hand, a .22-caliber rifle slung over his back and a band of ammunition on a belt.  It was May 1, 1992 – seven years before Columbine, before the days of active shooter drills, before anyone imagined a gunman entering a school and harming students would become a common occurrence.  Lindhurst High School was abuzz with anticipation – it was the day before the prom. Then, suddenly, the school erupted in chaos. The vaguely familiar young man stalked the halls, gunning down a teacher, shooting students in classrooms and holding dozens of others hostage. By the time the eight-hour siege was over, three students and a teacher were dead, and 10 people were wounded, court documents show.  The town of about 10,000 north of Sacramento was forever changed.   Authorities described the shooter, Eric Houston, then 20, as a Lindhurst High dropout who’d failed to graduate from the school three years earlier and who blamed his former history teacher, Robert Brens, for giving him a failing grade.    CNN spoke to Welch and Lynda Vanartsdalen, a former Lindhurst teacher who also survived the shooting. The two women described a drawn-out day of chaos, terror and questions that still haunt them three decades later.    Back then, attacks on schools were largely unheard of. Vanartsdalen and Welch never imagined so many other school shootings would follow.    “I can’t believe it’s still happening, 30 years later,” Vanartsdalen said.  The women said that every massacre at a school, like the recent one in Uvalde, Texas, brings back harrowing memories.  “I can feel the pain the students feel from losing a classmate,” said Welch, speaking of the Uvalde shooting. It’s a pain that may affect them for years to come, she said.    At first, she thought the shots she heard were seniors popping balloons  That afternoon, Welch recalls, she was in a history class in Building C, preparing for a quiz and chatting about summer plans with her classmates.  With the semester nearing its end, excitement filled the air.  “There were no signs of danger, no threats, everyone going about their day,” Welch said. “Seniors talking smack in the hallways about what they will do after graduation, others talking about summer vacations with friends and family, others making plans to meet up after school.”   Shortly afterward, several loud pops punctuated the students’ chatter.  Welch and her classmates initially dismissed the sounds, she said, thinking that giddy seniors were popping balloons. But the bangs got louder, Welch said, and students in the hallway started screaming.  Moments later, the gunman appeared in the doorway of her class, raised his gun and started firing. Her classmate, Beamon Hill, pushed her out of harm’s way, court documents say.   “Everything was happening so fast,” Welch said. “All I remember is Beamon instantly shoved me to the ground, taking the bullet.”  Welch fell to the floor and saw Beamon sprawled nearby, bleeding from his head, she said. She began weeping as she struggled to understand what was going on.  “Classmates yanked me behind a cabinet to hide and covered my mouth to stay quiet,” Welch said.  Before he reached Welch’s class, Houston had walked into Brens’ classroom and shot him in the chest as the teacher leaned on his desk in front of his students, court documents show.  Witnesses said Houston then turned around, pumped his weapon and shot student Judy Davis in the face and upper chest, court documents show. She tumbled from her seat to the floor. Houston left the room and gunned down senior Jason White in a hallway, then went to the world studies class, where he encountered Welch and Beamon, according to court documents.  Other than Brens, the other victims appeared to be chosen at random, authorities said. Witnesses told prosecutors Houston carried out his massacre impassively, without saying a word. ‘He was really like there was no one inside, no one home, no one in there,” student Gregory Howard later told a grand jury. “He looked like he didn’t have a soul.”   One teacher locked her classroom, turned off the lights and called 911  Vanartsdalen was in the same C building that afternoon.  In a sign of how unusual school shootings were then, one teacher later told her she initially thought the armed man was a soldier visiting from nearby Beale Air Force Base to discuss career options with students. “It was just a perfect California day, then all hell broke loose,” Vanartsdalen said. “Now every time I hear of another school shooting, my heart breaks. I know the pain and the hurt and the struggle they will go through for years to come.” A career adviser at the time, Vanartsdalen still remembers the smell of gunpowder in the hall and the sounds of students screaming. She recalls the discordant sound of birds chirping outside her office window as terrified students hid behind cabinets.   Vanartsdalen was in the career center with about two dozen students who had come to research careers during sixth period – the final one of the day, she said.  She remembers peeking outside and seeing the shooter pace up and down the hallway.  He fired again and again, unleashing a white cloud.  “There was all this popping and smoke,” Vanartsdalen said. “I can still smell the gunpowder to this day.”  Vanartsdalen removed her classroom’s door stop, closed and locked the door, and turned off the lights. She ordered the students onto the ground as gunshots and screams from other classrooms permeated the walls. She crawled across the floor, pulled a phone down from her desk and punched 911 over and over and over. No one answered, she said.  And then she and the other students waited.  “My mind was going a million miles an hour,” she said.  Some survivors fled the school and took refuge in a nearby house  Houston then herded students into an upstairs classroom in a corner of the building.  As he held them captive, he ranted about flunking out of school and blamed it on Brens, court documents said.  Meanwhile, Welch, Vanartsdalen and a group of students stayed in their hiding spots downstairs. After C building quieted down, someone opened an exit door and they all fled.  “We all ran like hell into the neighborhood, banging on people’s doors to let us in,” Welch said.  Vanartsdalen said she led Welch and a group of other students to a nearby house. In her eagerness to let the students inside, the teacher grabbed the screen door with such force that she yanked it off its hinges. The terrified homeowner was reluctant at first but allowed them to stay until Vanartsdalen could use the home’s phone to call all the kids’ parents.   After holing up in the house for hours, Welch was reunited with her father. Vanartsdalen remained at the neighbor’s house until the last child had gone home safely.  Not until she emerged three hours later and walked back to the school did she begin to comprehend the magnitude of what was happening.  “At the time, we thought we were the only survivors,” Vanartsdalen said. “Houston was still holding about 80 students hostage in a classroom, and no one knew what was going on.”  SWAT teams surrounded the building, waiting for the right moment to strike. Police and TV news helicopters hovered overhead.  As afternoon turned into dusk and the sky faded to black, a shell-shocked community awaited word on their loved ones.  The hours dragged on. Houston released a few students in exchange for soda and boxes of pizza.  He finally surrendered about 10:30 p.m., ending a tense standoff.  Vanartsdalen said she was still outside the school when authorities led him out in handcuffs.  That’s when she recognized the shooter as a student who had come to the career center a few years earlier.  She remembered a blond, withdrawn teen who barely spoke to anyone and didn’t seem to have many friends.  Three decades later, the shooting’s effects still linger  For Vanartsdalen and Welch, the impact of the tragedy lingers 30 years later.  Welch now 46, works at a hospital’s financial office in Lexington, Kentucky.  Vanartsdalen, 71, is retired and lives in Marysville, California, about five miles from Olivehurst.   Both women said surviving a school shooting heightens your alertness in a way nothing else does. Even now, every time they visit a store, restaurant, or other public place, the first thing they do is map out an exit strategy.    Vanartsdalen is wary of hovering helicopters, firecrackers and popping balloons. On a recent dinner date with her husband, she almost panicked when she noticed a man pacing anxiously in the restaurant. The moment passed without incident, but she remains vigilant about her safety.  Both women said they got weeks of counseling and therapy afterward. But back then, therapists were not as equipped to handle mass shootings.  “My therapist seemed so overwhelmed with everything, I stopped going after a while,” Welch said. “What seemed to help more was talking about it with other people in the community, both friends and strangers.”  Several months after the shooting, Welch was surprised to receive a package with an autographed photo and a note from Mariah Carey, one of her favorite singers.   “I’m so sorry to hear about your friend and the horrible situation you went through,” it said. “It’s great that you have such a positive attitude about things now.” And in 1994, Welch was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show, where she appeared with other survivors of mass shootings and shared her recollections of that fateful day.  “Oprah asked me questions about my experience and how I was handling things now. We did talk a little about Beamon,” she said. “What I remember most is her kindness … her words of encouragement to stay strong and do positive things in life.” These days, as school shootings become more common, Welch said she’s forced to replay that day over and over. Every new shooting is a trigger – and a reminder of what lies ahead for the survivors.  “Those poor kids from all these school shootings will have to learn how to live their lives going forward,” Welch said.    The women still remember those who died that day. Welch said she will never forget her classmate Beamon’s heroic act. She’s told her two children about the popular 16-year-old prankster who helped keep everyone loose and may have saved their mother’s life.  Welch said she remembers that earlier that day, Beamon had tossed a crumpled-up piece of paper across the classroom. When the teacher asked who did it, he had put on his game face and pointed at Welch. The other classmates erupted into laughter because they knew he was the culprit, she said.  “Beamon got me in so much trouble,” Welch said.  “He knew exactly how to make me smile when I was stressed before a test.”  Houston was eventually convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and remains on death row at San Quentin State Prison. The Olivehurst community has largely moved on from the shooting, Vanartsdalen said, and people there rarely talk about it, except on the anniversary.  But revisiting what happened on May 1, 1992, remains a form of therapy for her – and a way to honor those who were lost.  “Four people died that day,” she said. “We should never forget them.” "",",Angela Welch;Angela Welch;Angela Welch;Angela Welch;Jason White;Lynda Vanartsdalen;Lynda Vanartsdalen;Mariah Carey;Mariah Carey;Mariah Carey;Vincent Furr;Gregory Howard;Judy Davis;Beamon Hill;Robert Brens;Robert Brens,Lindhurst High School;Lindhurst High School;Lindhurst High School;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Beale Air Force,"TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,711;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,985;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,1084;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,2207;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,3170;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,4063;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5190;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5550;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5660;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5818;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5909;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6353;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6584;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6747;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6970;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,7248;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,7304;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,7624;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,8050;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,8420;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,416;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,2992;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,4181;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,4758;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,7564;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,8677;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,61;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,340;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,769;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,1537;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,3443;EDUCATION,61;EDUCATION,340;EDUCATION,435;EDUCATION,692;EDUCATION,769;EDUCATION,873;EDUCATION,1398;EDUCATION,1537;EDUCATION,1945;EDUCATION,2085;EDUCATION,2929;EDUCATION,3443;EDUCATION,4996;EDUCATION,5319;EDUCATION,6669;EDUCATION,6868;EDUCATION,7851;EDUCATION,8582;EDUCATION,9199;EDUCATION,11106;EDUCATION,11308;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,61;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,340;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,435;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,692;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,769;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,873;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1398;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1537;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1945;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2085;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2929;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3443;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4996;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5319;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6669;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6868;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,7851;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,8582;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,9199;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,11106;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,11308;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,61;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,340;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,435;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,692;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,769;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,873;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1398;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1537;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1945;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2085;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2929;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3443;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,4996;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,5319;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6669;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6868;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,7851;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,8582;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,9199;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,11106;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,11308;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,965;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,1096;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,1448;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,1692;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,4019;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,4846;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,5028;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,7325;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,7587;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,11928;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,922;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,5079;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,9561;",Houston;Beale Air Force Base;Marysville;Kentucky;Lindhurst High School;Olivehurst;Sacramento;Uvalde;Texas;California;San Quentin
560,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/wisconsin-senate-race/,"""articleBody"":""Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes are political opposites. But as the two prepare for what could become one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2022 cycle, they are leveling similar attacks to define each other: Casting their opponent as too extreme and out of touch with Wisconsin voters, while arguing the other is not a true representative of the state’s working class. “The problem is Ron Johnson has turned his back on working people and I’ve fought for working people my entire career, even before I was an office,” Barnes said when asked for the single biggest difference between himself and Johnson, who made millions running a plastics manufacturer before he entered public office. “His wealth isn’t the problem – it’s the fact that he is ultra-wealthy and out of touch.” Johnson’s campaign declined to make him available to CNN, but a Johnson campaign adviser previewed a notably similar message.  “(Barnes) is out of touch with where the majority of the state is,” said adviser Ben Voelkel, citing some of the more liberal positions Barnes has backed throughout his career. “Mandela Barnes talks a lot about his dad working the third shift work. … Mandela Barnes hasn’t done any of that. He has been a career political activist.” Johnson has already described Barnes as Democrats’ “most radical left candidate,” adding that “a radical left Senator from Wisconsin is not the solution.” Johnson recently called him “a progressive puppet out to fundamentally change America.” The attacks – delivered ahead of Tuesday’s Wisconsin Senate primaries, which appear to be already decided – are previews of what will likely become an acrimonious race, one that experts expect will see tens of millions spent on negative advertising as each side attempts to solidify their base voters in November. Johnson, the incumbent, faces no primary challenge after he opted to run for a third term. The senator, who promised to only serve another full term when he ran for reelection in 2016, waffled on the third term for months, but eventually decided to get into the race because “America is in peril” and he wants to end Democratic control of Washington. Barnes initially had significant primary challengers, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who spent more than $11 million of his own money airing ads throughout the state. But over the span of a week last month, Barnes’ three top primary opponents – Lasry, Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson – all dropped out of the race and endorsed the lieutenant governor, effectively ending the primary. “I could not have imagined it ending up this way,” Barnes told CNN. “To me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the democratic majority is.” As the two candidates turn their focus on each other, Wisconsin represents yet another example of a high stakes Senate race where the contrast between candidates is significant, including Republican Herschel Walker vs. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Republican Mehmet Oz against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Republican Blake Masters vs. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona.  ‘The most vulnerable Republican incumbent’  The Barnes strategy is to define Johnson as a changed man, someone who went to Washington as an insurgent candidate but then enmeshed himself into the Republican Party led by former President Donald Trump. The attacks will include Johnson’s own admission that the 2017 tax bill passed by Republicans in Washington benefited his own company; his reported role in attempting to push a slate of fake electors after the 2020 election; and his more recent suggestion that Social Security and Medicare, two popular social spending programs, be changed from mandatory to discretionary spending, something experts argue could effectively end the programs. “What we ought to be doing is we ought to turn everything into discretionary spending so that it’s all evaluated so that we can fix problems or fix programs that are broken that are going to be going bankrupt,” Johnson said earlier this month. Barnes wasted no time jumping on the comment, using it to argue that Johnson’s personal wealth makes it impossible for him to understand what these programs mean to working class people. “If he wants be anti-Social Security, that’s on him,” Barnes told CNN, using the Johnson comment to inoculate himself from Republican charges of being too extreme. “That’s much more extreme than wanting working families and people all across Wisconsin have a fair shot.” With the primary all but decided, Barnes put out an attack ad earlier this month that hit Johnson on outsourcing jobs, using the senator’s defense of a company that took jobs out of Wisconsin. “Ron Johnson couldn’t be more out of touch with Wisconsin,” the ad says. Democrats are also preparing to paint Johnson as a candidate who has become a conspiracy theory promoter, including questioning the push to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, calling climate change “bullsh*t,” and suggesting – without any evidence – that the FBI had more inside knowledge than it let on about the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. Republican operatives working on Senate campaigns acknowledged the impact some of Johnson’s comments have had on his image. A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 46% of Wisconsin voters viewed him unfavorably, compared to 37% who had a favorable view. But one operative argued that some positive Johnson messaging over the summer, including significant spending by an outside group focused on inflation and a Johnson campaign ad focus on legislation that allowed for more experimental drug treatments, have done some rehabilitation. “His numbers are moving in the right direction,” the operative said, adding that, no matter what, “it is going to be a close race.” Democrats see negative views of Johnson as central to their plan of turning the general election into a referendum of the senator. “Ron Johnson is, without a doubt, the most vulnerable Republican incumbent on the map,” said Amanda Sherman Baity, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ‘Defined by all these left-wing positions’ The attacks on Barnes center on accusations that he is too extreme for the state, using his time as a community organizer, a state assemblyman from a solidly Democratic district and a “longtime leader” in the Working Families Party against him as he runs for Senate. The hits include his ties to members of the “Squad,” a group of liberal lawmakers in Congress who are often attacked by Republicans; a photo taken of him holding up an “Abolish ICE” T-shirt; and positions like ending cash bail, supporting the Green New Deal and a host of other views the Johnson campaign believes are too “extreme” for Wisconsin voters. Barnes has said he does not support abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but supports “addressing the concerns and issues and challenges that people have so that we can have a fair, comprehensive immigration reform system.” “All of these things are positions that might get you applause at a Working Families Party rally or get you the endorsement of AOC or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but when you look across the state, that is not where 50+1 of the state sits,” Voelkel said. One issue that Barnes’ campaign must confront is the fact that polls show that many Wisconsin voters don’t know enough about him to have an opinion – something that can be both helpful and hurtful. “Barnes is not nearly as known in the state as Johnson,” said Charles Franklin, pollster for the Marquette Law School poll, citing a recent poll that found over 50% of Democratic primary voters didn’t know enough about the lieutenant governor to form an opinion. “That is an opportunity for the Johnson side … to really try to step in and define Barnes.” And they plan to do just that, with the Johnson campaign and outside groups already gearing up to cast Barnes as out of step with most Wisconsin voters. “He is going to be defined by all these left-wing positions that he took in the past,” said Jack Pandol, spokesman for Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC focused on Senate races. “There is a lot that voters are going to be made aware of in the coming months and that will be the first information that some voters are getting about Barnes.” Barnes responded to these attacks by saying Republicans “tried to say the same thing about Tammy Baldwin,” and she went on to win the state’s other Senate seat in 2012 and reelection in 2018. “People like Ron Johnson are going to lie about whatever, anything he can think of, to take the heat off his own bad behavior,” he said. ‘We were polarized before it was cool’ The question among experts in Wisconsin is whether, after years of polarization and remarkably tight elections, there are even enough persuadable voters in the state to make the general election anything more than a base-focused race. Wisconsin has been a swing state for years. When Trump won it in 2016, he was the first Republican to win it since 1984. While Biden won the state back in 2020, the state has long had years of Republican governors, including Scott Walker from 2011 to 2019, and Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. “We were polarized before it was cool,” said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic operative in Wisconsin, arguing that the fights around union rights in 2011 and 2012 led to the state being deeply polarized long before the arrival of Donald Trump. “So that shrinking segment of swing voters is kind of the ball game. Yes, the political environment may be bad, but Republicans’ brand is rotten with those voters.” This is why political watchers like Franklin and others expect a deluge of negative ads in the contest, with both sides running campaigns that “reflect that polarization that we have had for a good 12 years.” Democrats are confident that if they can turn the race into a referendum on Johnson, there are enough votes who have backed him in the past who are ready for an alternative. “There is absolutely a world of ticket splitters, a world of persuadable voters and a world of people who might or might turn out,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.  Democrats do, however, face a difficult national environment, with President Joe Biden’s poll numbers slumping and voters across the country skeptical of Democratic leadership in Washington. With this in mind, Barnes argued it would be Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers – not the president – who would have the most direct impact on the contest. Evers himself is up for reelection. While he did not have a primary challenge, he will likely face a tough race against whoever emerges from what has been a tight Republican primary race on Tuesday. “This is a very Wisconsin focused race,” he said, citing a recent poll that found 48% of Wisconsin voters approved of Evers. “I would say that people know the work that we’ve been doing here in state and this race isn’t going to be determined about what people think about national politics.”"",",John Fetterman;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Mehmet Oz;Tom Nelson;Ben Voelkel;Scott Walker;Elizabeth Warren;Alex Lasry;Joe Biden;Charles Franklin;Ben Wikler;Raphael Warnock;Tammy Baldwin;Herschel Walker;Joe Zepecki;Jack Pandol;Tony Evers;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Amanda Sherman Baity;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Sarah Godlewski;Mark Kelly,Senate Leadership Fund;Republican Party;Democratic Party Of Wisconsin;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Marquette Law School;Marquette Law School;Families Party;Families Party;Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee;Wisconsin Senate,"TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,904;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,1021;EDUCATION,5414;EDUCATION,7699;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,93;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1263;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9651;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9747;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,394;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,25;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3032;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3108;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3179;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3269;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3457;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4516;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5273;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6127;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,8239;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9119;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9220;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9689;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,10821;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,25;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3032;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3108;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3179;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3269;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3457;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4516;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5273;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6127;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,8239;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9119;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9220;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9689;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,10821;LEADER,2611;LEADER,7820;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,1335;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,704;ELECTION,339;ELECTION,1808;ELECTION,5453;ELECTION,6898;ELECTION,7492;ELECTION,7772;ELECTION,8080;ELECTION,8301;ELECTION,8406;ELECTION,8947;ELECTION,9605;ELECTION,9723;ELECTION,10182;ELECTION,10416;ELECTION,10953;",Pennsylvania;Outagamie County;Wisconsin;Arizona;America;Georgia;Washington;Milwaukee

View more opinion on CNN. In homes swaddled in velvet curtains and where even the lavatories may be carpeted, where showers can be a challenge to centuries-old pipes, and iced tea is a contradiction in terms – hot is really horrid.    Welcome to Britain, where this week urban fires spontaneously erupted, the Queen’s guards melted under bearskins, trains ground to a halt and Members of Parliament – grudgingly – removed their jackets. As the United Kingdom officially experienced its hottest day ever at 40.3C (104.5F), large swathes of the country fried in the heat, and a population accustomed to such adjectives as “mild,” “tepid” and “clement” to describe its weather suffered a blast from the scorching blowtorch that is global warming. After millennia bemoaning leaden skies and constant drizzle, Britons took to complaining about the heat with aplomb; actually coping with Saharan-like temperatures came less naturally. The difficulty adjusting is perhaps forgivable. Shakespeare’s “other Eden” was always a temperate place, of gentle summers, where the biggest concern was that a passing shower might delay the village cricket match, not that the umpire could expire of sunstroke.  Frankly, we couldn’t cope. We were – literally – un-cool. As Aussies tweeted “helpful” tips for surviving the heatwave, hospitals canceled operations, teachers cut classes and planes were grounded as the runway melted. As for public transport: no chance.  South Yorkshire’s Barnsley – sodden, dank Barnsley, for heaven’s sake, a place with many charms but hardly the Riviera, was hotter than Beirut – by 20 degrees. It was all terribly un-British. Sure, there had been forest fires in France all week, and Australia and California seem to spend half the year ablaze these days – but Wennington in east London (where a sudden inferno consumed a row of terraced houses)? That’s freaky stuff. A kind of madness took over. As the Met Office’s first ever Red warning was issued, countless men fired up their barbeques as if they wanted to self-immolate while scorching meat. Milk-white bodies unused to the sunshine glare roasted to a deep hue of lobster. We ate ice lollies and complained and sweated and sat in kids’ paddling pools and complained and rescued dogs trapped in hot cars and complained and crowded on to beaches and into parks and complained, and it was just a lot and it was very, very hot.  Along with many others, my company issued a stern shelter-at-home edict (so nostalgic, so Covid-19 Christmas 2020) until it became clear working from home in fact constituted a cruel and unusual punishment under the UN Charter of Human Rights. Victorian terraces and 1960s tower blocks were never meant for heat like this. Sans air conditioning, upper floor bedrooms became uninhabitable and sleep impossible; by night, we sweated dreamlessly, fantasizing about the shutters and terracotta of Spain; the stone floors of the south of France. Several of my co-workers made a dash for it to the office, like soldiers crossing no man’s land, gambling that 30 minutes of the red fires of hell that was the Jubilee Line were worth enduring to make it to the oasis of air-conditioning in our unusually modern offices in the landmark Shard skyscraper. Meanwhile my family and I packed our bags and headed to the coast – a balmy 96F – where traffic jams snaked back to the motorway and the ice cream trucks ran out of the sweet stuff by 10am.  Back in Westminster, where I usually ply my trade, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, bent so far as to tell gentlemen MPs they could remove their jackets for the remainder of the week, although a dim view would be taken of those who eschewed ties. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace spoke for many when he confessed to finding the relaxation in the dress code somewhat discombobulating. What next, he mused, flip flops in the hallowed chamber? Outside in the corridors of power, the remaining candidates in the Conservative Party leadership contest to replace Boris Johnson as Prime Minister continued to woo their peers, perspiring their way through a never-ending series of hustings and debates. Critics have flagged the lack of mention of the planet in the contest. Like Meryl Streep’s president in the satire “Don’t Look Up,” the contenders seem content to blithely discuss the future of Britain in terms of taxes and woke wars, even as the asteroid of climate change barrels towards them.  By Tuesday night, the skies above London had opened; the worst of the heat wave was over, for now. But we won’t be putting the barbeque away; it’s due to be 85F on Sunday."",",Theresa May;Meryl Streep;Lindsay Hoyle;Ben Wallace,Twitter;Facebook;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Members Of Parliament,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,4646;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,72;LEADER,177;LEADER,4734;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,177;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,4734;MILITARY,3616;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIERS,3616;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIERS,3616;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,640;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,640;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,2584;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVE,5334;TAX_WORLDCRUSTACEANS_LOBSTER,2666;TAX_DISEASE_GAMBLING,3648;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,3104;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2680;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,3975;TAX_FNCACT_PEERS,4763;TAX_DISEASE_SUNSTROKE,1463;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,962;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,121;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,4067;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,2387;NATURAL_DISASTER_FOREST_FIRES,2178;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,4204;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4939;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4672;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEATWAVE,1807;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,848;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1120;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3311;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5329;TRAFFIC,3932;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2172;WB_1777_FORESTS,2172;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2172;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2172;AFFECT,2762;SOC_SELFIMMOLATION,2563;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,82;DELAY,1389;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1389;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3235;EDUCATION,1850;KILL,2604;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,601;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,21;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,89;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,11;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,516;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1931;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,177;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,4734;USPEC_POLICY1,5056;EPU_CATS_TAXES,5056;URBAN,561;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DOGS,2767;ARMEDCONFLICT,5068;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,5068;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,5068;MEDICAL,1819;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITALS,1819;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_CONSERVATIVE_PARTY,4672;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,3242;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,3242;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3242;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,3242;WB_698_TRADE,4186;MEDIA_SOCIAL,5223;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,681;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1351;TAX_FNCACT_UMPIRE,1437;WB_137_WATER,4051;MEDIA_MSM,43;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,1014;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,1014;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,1014;TAX_FNCACT_GENTLEMEN,4257;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,3632;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,4032;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,962;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,4408;",London;Britain;Britons;Australia;Wennington;France;California;United Kingdom;British;Aussies;Beirut;Spain
459,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/fashion/best-leggings-on-amazon,"""articleBody"":""If there was ever a perfect place to find leggings, it’s on Amazon. With every plausible categorization, from breathable nonslip to compression pocketed, there’s something for everyone. But a quick Amazon search for leggings yields over 40,000 product results, which can be pretty overwhelming. Luckily, we spoke with personal trainers, athleticwear designers and fitness instructors to get the scoop on what you should look for to find the best quality leggings on Amazon. Experts agree that the type of activity you’re doing matters. For example, when sprinting or boxing, USA Boxing coach and FightCamp trainer Jess Evans recommends a thicker, form-fitting waistband. “A thin waistband squeezes your waist instead of supporting it. I prefer a snug waistband for running or jumping,” she says. For Jordan Robbins, founder and CEO of Revly Sport, material is key. “Whether I am wearing leggings to a HIIT class or running errands, I don’t want to worry about them ripping,” she says. She recommends a compressing nylon-spandex blend. On the other hand, distance runners should prioritize finding lightweight leggings with sweat-wicking material. With comfort, functionality, material, style and price in mind, here’s what these fitness experts recommend."",",Jess Evans,United States,,United States
160,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/sinema-drought-tax-and-climate-bill/,"""articleBody"":""As Democrats scramble to clinch a deal on their tax and climate package, a last-minute demand is coming from key vote Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona: $5 billion to help the Southwest deal with its multi-year drought. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, confirmed to CNN that Sinema is seeking $5 billion worth of drought resilience funding. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said he’s “aware of the request.”   “I’m looking forward to details, I do welcome the additional resources for drought resilience,” Padilla told CNN.  Sinema is not the only lawmaker asking leadership to add drought funding, a source familiar with the negotiations told CNN. A coalition of several Western lawmakers who represent states in the Colorado River basin are in talks with Democratic leadership, and staff-level conversations are centered around seeking funding for programs that would be managed by the US Bureau of Reclamation – the federal agency that oversees the Colorado River.  The focus, the source said, would be to blunt the impact of the drought on farmers and cities in the West. A senior Democratic source told CNN they believe Democratic leaders will accommodate Sinema’s concerns, as well as her request to drop a $14 billion carried interest tax provision from the bill. Sinema’s office did not respond to CNN’s questions about the drought request.  Padilla and other senators from Western states told CNN that the years-long drought is a paramount concern.   Around 90% of Arizona was in some level of drought this week, according to the US Drought Monitor. And exceptional drought, the monitor’s most dire category, has also spread across parts of California, Nevada and Utah.   The senators’ drought request also comes as the US Bureau of Reclamation prepares its August report on the future of Lake Mead — which has continued its precipitous decline this year — and the Colorado River. CNN has reported that more water cuts are likely for the Southwest, given recent projections.  The drought, which scientists reported in February is the region’s worst in 12 centuries, has had sprawling consequences beyond water shortages, including extraordinarily dry vegetation, which has fueled intense and fast-moving wildfires.  “Things are terrible with drought in Colorado and the Colorado River Basin,” Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told CNN. “There’s half the water in the Colorado River that we need. This is a profoundly difficult time for the people that I represent.”  Bennet said he “cannot vote for a bill unless it improves the condition of the Colorado River in Colorado and in the upper basin,” and called for lawmakers to focus on long-term and lasting fixes, though he didn’t say exactly what was needed.   “I hope we can get to a solution, but it’s going to have to be a real solution – not these short-term temporary solutions that have spent lots of money but not seen any result from the point of view of the river basin,” Bennet said.  Padilla, who represents California, said drought conditions are “very bad” there. “There’s a sustained drought, it’s very concerning both from a water supply standpoint and of course wildfires,” Padilla said. “Drought, extreme heat, and windy conditions; it’s a dangerous recipe.”  Funding for drought resilience was also written into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Biden signed in November and Sinema played a key role in crafting. The bipartisan bill included $8.3 billion for water infrastructure programs and $1.4 billion for ecosystem restoration and resilience.

276,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/health/california-newsom-state-of-emergency-monkeypox/,"""articleBody"":""The governors of California and Illinois declared states of emergency to bolster their monkeypox vaccination efforts as the virus spreads nationwide. Monday’s declarations come as more than 5,800 probable or confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported in the US. California had more than 800 cases Tuesday, while Illinois had more than 500, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the World Health Organization has declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the Biden administration has not issued a nationwide public health emergency declaration. California is the third and largest state to issue a statewide declaration related to the disease. New York was the first to do so. California’s move allows emergency medical services personnel throughout the state to administer FDA-approved monkeypox vaccines, expanding the pool of people able to inoculate residents against the virus even as a vaccine shortage persists. “Expanding the pool of eligible vaccinators will substantially aid current efforts and support anticipated further vaccination efforts upon receipt of additional doses from the federal government,” the proclamation said. “California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release.  Illinois’ declaration also will make more resources available to combat the virus, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. The Chicago and state public health departments announced Illinois’ first presumptive case June 2.  “I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and coordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating, and preventing the spread of MPV,” Pritzker tweeted. “In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBTQ+ community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.” Monkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox, that usually causes pimple- or blister-like lesions, as well as flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills and respiratory symptoms, according to the CDC. The virus can spread to anyone through close, often skin-to-skin contact, according to the CDC. It’s also possible for people to get monkeypox from infected animals. California has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses so far and distributed more than 25,000, according to the governor’s news release. Los Angeles County has received its own vaccine allocation, and state officials said California will make additional allocations in the coming weeks.  Last week, San Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency on monkeypox. “We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” the California governor said. California has been using testing, contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure built for the Covid-19 pandemic to respond to monkeypox outbreaks, Newsom’s office said. The CDC has made the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease, but access is limited in California. Now, the treatment can be administered at more than 30 facilities and providers across the state, officials said. California has also expanded its monkeypox testing capacity and can process more than 1,000 tests a week, according to Newsom. The state’s first case of monkeypox was reported May 21 and involved someone who had traveled abroad. Now, there are probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 27 different local health jurisdictions, including a case involving a toddler. In mid-July, California’s health department requested 600,000 to 800,000 additional monkeypox vaccine doses to help expand eligibility to both confirmed and probable exposures, as well as to high-risk individuals.  The health department is “hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state’s request,” it said in a news release Friday. As of last week, the US Department of Health and Human Services had delivered more than 336,000 doses of Jynneos – an FDA-approved vaccine created for smallpox and monkeypox – from the strategic national stockpile. Health authorities throughout the country have been focused on education efforts to inform Americans about how monkeypox spreads.  Monkeypox, according to the CDC, can spread via “respiratory secretions” and by touching objects contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. Many of the cases in the latest outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, but monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.  A large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts on this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact. “Our team is also committed to reducing stigma among the LGBTQ community, which has been singled out and treated unfairly because of this outbreak. No single individual or community is to blame for the spread of any virus. Monkeypox can affect anyone as it spreads by skin-to-skin contact, as well as from sharing items like clothing, bedding and towels,” California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said in a Friday statement. Following the emergency declaration in California, Equality California, a major LGBT rights nonprofit organization, applauded the governor’s move, noting in a statement that the virus “continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men here in California and across the country.” Earlier Monday, state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, and members of the LGBTQ caucus called on Newsom to issue $38.5 million in an emergency budget appropriation to support local monkeypox response.

385,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/tech/tesla-stock-split/,"""articleBody"":""Tesla officially announced a three-for-one stock split, meaning the company’s stock price — which has jockeyed between $600 and $1,000 for a year — is about to get more affordable for investors. The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) shareholders approved the split Thursday at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting. Following the split, a person who owned one share of the company will hold three, and the price of each of those shares will be one-third of the price at that time. At Friday’s closing price of roughly $865, that would make the post-split price per share just about $288.  Stock splits are usually done to increase a stock’s liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the shares. Essentially, the move will triple the number of Tesla shares on the market, but the company’s overall valuation — and the value of each investor’s holding — won’t change. Splits can also boost demand for a stock because it puts the price within the reach of smaller, individual investors. Tesla’s made such a move before, as recently as 2020. Although deep-pocketed institutional investors don’t care as much about the company’s overall stock price, individual investors might be turned off by high-priced shares. The growth of zero-fee trading apps, including Robinhood, E-Trade and others, have made stock splits much more important in recent years. When Tesla announced its intention to pursue a stock split earlier this year, it said in a regulatory filing it believes “the stock split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity, all of which, in our view, may help maximize stockholder value.”  CNN’s David Goldman contributed to this report"",",David Goldman,Cnn;Cnn,"ECON_STOCKMARKET,67;ECON_STOCKMARKET,101;ECON_STOCKMARKET,234;ECON_STOCKMARKET,649;ECON_STOCKMARKET,693;ECON_STOCKMARKET,979;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1220;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1383;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1482;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1561;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1621;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,1532;WB_698_TRADE,253;WB_698_TRADE,1319;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;TAX_FNCACT_INVESTOR,909;TAX_ECON_PRICE,107;TAX_ECON_PRICE,471;TAX_ECON_PRICE,524;TAX_ECON_PRICE,562;TAX_ECON_PRICE,615;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1005;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1226;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1601;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1410;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1643;",New York
413,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/health/monkeypox-vaccine-health-wen-wellness/,"""articleBody"":""Monkeypox is spreading in the United States and around the world. There are at least 26,000 infections documented in over 80 countries. The World Health Organization has declared it a public health emergency of international concern. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting more than 6,600 infections, just two months after monkeypox was first detected in this outbreak, and on Thursday, the Biden administration officially declared monkeypox to be a public health emergency in the United States.   How much should people worry about contracting monkeypox? Should everyone be trying to get the vaccine? Who are the groups most at risk, and what actions should they take? How exactly is monkeypox spread and how can people prevent from trying to get it? What are common symptoms to look out for? To help us better understand monkeypox and the risk it poses, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.” CNN: How is monkeypox spread? Is it as transmissible as Covid-19, another disease that we know very well by now? Dr. Leana Wen: Monkeypox is not spread like Covid-19. As we know by now, Covid-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread through microscopic aerosols. That means you could be infected by someone who you’re having a casual conversation with or even someone who happens to be in the same conference room or restaurant as you. Monkeypox is primarily spread through prolonged, direct, skin-to-skin contact. Most cases thus far have been linked to sexual activity though this is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Rather, individuals can spread monkeypox through intimate contact, such as kissing, hugging, cuddling and sexual intercourse.    Individuals who have lesions can also shed virus onto bedsheets, towels and other linens that can spread the virus to others. This is why people with active monkeypox lesions are instructed not to share potentially contaminated items like linens, towels, drinking glasses and eating utensils with others. CNN: What kinds of symptoms do patients with monkeypox have? Wen: People who contract monkeypox often first start developing fever, headache, muscles aches and overall fatigue — similar to many other viral illnesses. Many people also have lymph node swelling. They then develop a rash that progresses into blisters, pimples or sores. The lesions can be all over the body or only in one part. It could be localized to just the anal or genital area, on the face, inside the mouth, or any other part of the body.  A large study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 528 infections across 43 sites in 16 countries. It found that the most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, muscle aches and lymph node swelling. Nearly all had a rash with blisters, though some individuals only had one lesion while others had several or more. Some people only had sores inside their mouth or in their anal or genital areas. Clinicians seeing patients with a fever and new rash should have a low threshold for testing for monkeypox, especially if the patient is in a high-risk group for contracting monkeypox. Importantly, the recent study also found that 29% of people diagnosed with monkeypox had a sexually transmitted infection. To me, this means that just because a patient is diagnosed with one thing doesn’t mean they can’t have another, too, and patients in high-risk groups who have new lesions need to get tested to rule out monkeypox. CNN: What started monkeypox, and how widespread is it in the United States? Wen: Monkeypox is a virus that is in the same family as the smallpox virus. It was first discovered in 1958 in monkeys, hence the name, though its usual animal hosts are rodents and other small mammals. It first appeared in humans in 1970 in East Africa. It has been endemic in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks sometimes occurring when infected travelers bring back the disease to their home countries. There was a big outbreak in the United States in 2003 due to imported rodents. This outbreak is much larger. More than 6,600 people have been infected in the United States thus far, with infections seen in almost every state. The CDC has an updated map of cases and infections here.  CNN: Who are the individuals in the high-risk groups for contracting monkeypox? Wen: Thus far, monkeypox has predominantly affected gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. In the New England Journal of Medicine international case series, 98% of people with monkeypox were gay or bisexual, and the transmission was linked to sexual activity in 95% of the cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the “vast majority” of cases in the United States are in men who have sex with men, with a median age of 36.  Currently individuals at high risk are men who have sex with men and who have sex with multiple or anonymous partners. There are also reports in the United States of some women and two children who have contracted monkeypox, who are all believed to be direct contacts of men who have sex with men. CNN: Has anyone died from monkeypox? Wen: Monkeypox usually has a fatality rate of 3% to 6%, according to the World Health Organization. Thankfully, no one has died from monkeypox in the United States yet, but this is a painful disease that can and does lead to severe illness and death. Those particularly vulnerable include pregnant women, young children and immunocompromised people. CNN: How much should people worry about monkeypox? Wen: Because of the way that monkeypox is spread, it is not yet a concern for most Americans. However, individuals who are gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, who have intimate contact with multiple or anonymous people, are at high risk.   These individuals should immediately seek testing if they have a new rash or sore, and they should avoid close physical contact in the meantime. People who wish to reduce their risk should avoid crowded clubs, raves, sex parties and other places where there is prolonged skin-to-skin or face-to-face contact with many people who may be wearing less clothing. CNN: Should everyone try to get the monkeypox vaccine? Wen: No. First of all, the monkeypox vaccine is extremely limited right now. About 600,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine have been delivered thus far, much less than the 1.5 million to 1.6 million people the CDC says are eligible. Those who should definitely get the vaccine are those with known exposure to someone with monkeypox. If given within four days of exposure, the vaccine can prevent someone from developing monkeypox. If given within two weeks, it lessens the likelihood of progression to severe illness. Soon, I hope there will be enough vaccine so that people in high-risk groups are able to access it. But given the way that monkeypox is spread, most Americans are not likely to contract it, and a mass vaccination campaign targeting the general population is probably not going to be recommended any time soon. CNN: Is monkeypox going to be yet another virus that will be endemic in the United States?  Wen: I really hope not. It is still possible to contain monkeypox through testing and vaccination. I hope that the WHO’s declaration of a global health emergency will spur more countries, including ours, to put every effort to try to prevent monkeypox from taking hold and becoming endemic here. And I think the Biden administration’s declaration will make a difference, too, to improve coordination and marshal needed resources."",",Leana Wen;Leana Wen,Public Health;Public Health;Public

343,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/inflation-reduction-act-senate-reconciliation-bill/,"""articleBody"":""The latest Senate budget reconciliation deal is titled the Inflation Reduction Act, a nod to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who repeatedly refused to support the Democrats’ previous spending proposals because of inflation concerns. But economists disagree over whether the climate, health care and tax package would, in fact, live up to its name, particularly in the short term.  Some experts, including two economists influential among Democratic leaders, argue that the legislation would likely have a small effect on tamping down inflation or none at all. One independent analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model found that it might cause a slight uptick in inflation over the next few years but then reduce it later. Other economists, including 126 economists who sent a letter to congressional leadership Tuesday, are more bullish on the bill’s prospects to lower prices, though they did not qualify the extent. The letter writers include former Democratic administration officials and experts from left-leaning think tanks who argue that because the legislation would lower the deficit, it would put “downward pressure on inflation.” They urged Congress to pass the bill because of its “crucial investments in energy, health care and in shoring up the nation’s tax system.” It’s not unusual for economists to come to different conclusions, which can be influenced by partisan views on what data to evaluate and how much weight to give it.  Inflation surged to a new pandemic-era peak in June, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. US consumer prices jumped by 9.1% year over year, the highest level in more than 40 years. What’s in the bill Drastically scaled back from the Democrats’ initial spending proposals, the bill would allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of certain prescription medications, limit the price growth of certain drugs to inflation and cap what Medicare enrollees pay out of pocket for medications bought at the pharmacy.  It would also extend the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies through 2025 and provide $369 billion in tax credits and investments aimed at combating climate change, the biggest such effort in US history. And the legislation would create a new 15% minimum tax on the corporate profits that large companies report to shareholders, as well as close the carried interest loophole, which lets certain investment managers pay lower capital gains tax rates on a portion of their compensation. It would also give the Internal Revenue Service about $80 billion to increase enforcement. All told, the package would reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion over a decade, according to Senate Democrats. Argument for little inflation impact The act would “very slightly increase inflation” for the first few years and then reduce it a bit by the late 2020s, according to a preliminary analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, an independent research group that Manchin consults. The bill could initially add a little to inflation because extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies would put more money in the pockets of several million people, particularly lower- and moderate-income folks who would be more likely to spend it, said Kent Smetters, the group’s faculty director. The deficit reduction spurred by the drug price and tax measures, which kicks in during the latter part of the 10-year window, could then tamp down inflation. However, statistically, it has zero effect, the analysis found. “We don’t have a lot of confidence that this has any impact on inflation,” Smetters said. “It’s just simply not big enough, relative to the size of the rest of the economy.” Moody’s Analytics, whose work is often cited by the Biden administration, also found that the legislation is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on inflation.  It estimates the plan would lower the consumer price inflation index by 0.33% by the fourth quarter of 2031. That translates to a reduction in CPI inflation of 3.3 basis points per year on average.    “The impact on inflation is small,” Moody’s concludes.  Moody’s report found that the legislation would help ease inflation through extending Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and addressing climate change.  For instance, Moody’s estimates the energy provisions in the plan would reduce the typical American household’s spending on energy by an estimated $300 per year in 2018 dollars. Families would also be helped by lower insurance rates due to the reduction in emissions and physical risks, Moody’s said. Even though the legislation is much smaller in scale and scope than the original Build Back Better agenda, Moody’s concluded it will have a “material beneficial economic impact.”  “While modest legislation, there is plenty to like in the Inflation Reduction Act,” Moody’s economists led by Mark Zandi wrote in the analysis, obtained first by CNN.  Zandi was among the economists urging Congress to pass the legislation. Why the bill could reduce inflation Senate Democrats, however, contend that the bill would lower inflation. Manchin took issue with the Penn Wharton analysis, calling it “wrong” on CNN on Sunday. “How can it add flames to inflation fires right now if you’re paying down debt,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The package counters inflation in three ways, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CNN’s John Berman. It reduces budget deficits, and therefore, the level of demand in the economy. Also, it cuts prices on prescription drugs, while increasing supply by stimulating energy production and subsidizing the transition to renewable energy.  “Less demand, more supply and direct, better bargaining for lower prices – those are the things that are involved in reducing inflation,” said Summers, who last year had warned that rising inflation was not transitory. “This bill is fighting inflation, and it’s got a whole set of collateral benefits, as well. It’s fair to call it the Inflation Reduction Act.” Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who was among the signers of the letter to congressional leaders, said a key driver of inflation is high energy costs, which the bill seeks to address through environmental investments.  “There is a simmering debate on the causes of inflation, but whatever side one takes in that debate, this bill is a step forward,” said Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University.

308,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/pelosi-taiwan-risks-greater-instability-us-china-analysis/,"""articleBody"":""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has already set off a fierce rhetorical response between the United States and China and sparked fears in Washington that Beijing will engineer an unprecedented escalation in the Taiwan Strait. Yet neither the United States nor China has any real interest in their budding superpower rivalry boiling over into open military clashes at this point, despite the soaring tensions caused by her arrival on Tuesday. And yet, the showdown is over the issue that is more likely than any other to spark a future US-China war. And Pelosi’s trip is almost certain to create greater instability in the relationship that would make future conflict more likely. Furious Chinese warnings that the California Democrat shouldn’t go and Washington’s vows not to be intimidated, meanwhile, show how inflamed political forces in each nation could make it almost impossible to manage the world’s most sensitive geopolitical duel. Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said in a statement on Tuesday that the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.” The long-time critic of the Chinese communist government and its alleged human rights abuses arrived in Taipei despite extraordinary warnings from Beijing of reprisals and consequences. Ahead of Pelosi’s arrival, rhetoric was flying between Washington and Beijing. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NBC’s “Today” that China “should think very carefully” about escalating the situation and warned the US would do whatever was necessary to protect its interests.  But China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi renewed President Xi Jinping’s warning in a call to President Joe Biden last week that Washington should not “play with fire” on Taiwan and reiterated Beijing’s “One China” policy. Pelosi’s position and new conditions created by the nationalistic rule of Xi, as well as Beijing’s new assertiveness and military and strategic power, make this the most risky brinkmanship over Taiwan in decades.  Given that Pelosi is in Taipei, the question has now become how Beijing will respond. Most of its options – following a barrage of threats and propaganda that have raised expectations for its riposte – are quite alarming. Most analysts think that some kind of military show of force is likely, at a time when China has already been sending its jets into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in unprecedented numbers. While China’s moves may not directly threaten US naval forces in the area, they could add to the potential for miscalculations – and also raise the prospect of how Taiwan would respond to serious provocations. Why would Pelosi go? So why did Pelosi go and would her trip needlessly antagonize China’s leadership?  Supporters of the visit, who unusually include many Republicans lined up behind Pelosi, say it’s critical for the speaker to show support for Taiwan and to underscore Washington is serious about its legal commitment to offer the island the means of its self-defense. Pelosi is also a symbol of democracy – a way of life that Taipei is desperate to preserve under China’s authoritarian shadow. But the controversy is not limited to Taiwan. This is about a broader context of China’s building challenge to America’s determination to preserve democracy, Western values and military and economic primacy in the Pacific and across the world.   Once news of Pelosi’s expected visit leaked, it became politically implausible – domestically and for strategic reasons – for her to bend to Beijing’s warnings that she should not go. It would be unpalatable for Pelosi, following a political career partly defined by standing up to China, to give up on her plan. And it would send a message that the United States, in one of its first standoffs with a newly confident superpower rival in the Pacific, would back down. Biden also had political considerations. While he publicly admitted that the US military was worried about the visit, he could not openly side with China over Pelosi. And a President can hardly order one of the top representatives of another branch of government what she should and should not do, even if officials worked to apprise the speaker of all the potential consequences of her decision. Politics are driving China’s actions too  Politics rage within the Chinese politburo, too, though many in the West often view China’s communist leadership as monolithic. Xi built his power base on aggressive nationalism and the idea that Taiwan’s destiny is “reunification” with the mainland. He is determined to preside over a national rejuvenation that will purge China’s past humiliation over colonialism and long 20th century isolation when it did not wield what he views as its rightful influence in the world. So Pelosi’s expected visit is more than a jab at China; it’s a personal slight to Xi’s core project by one of the most senior US politicians – and is one that demands a political response. The crisis also comes at a pivotal moment in Beijing. In a few months, Xi is poised to claim an unusual third term and he cannot afford to be seen as weak. And his government’s questionable handling of the Covid-19 pandemic – mass lockdowns are still common in Chinese cities – and a slowing economy, mean Xi could be tempted into a nationalistic stand to mask domestic liabilities. A long festering dispute While the current standoff is alarming, Taiwan has long been an irritant in US-China relations. The dispute is made even more confusing by complicated diplomatic agreements and nuanced US strategic doctrines designed to avoid the possibility of war with China. The island is viewed by Beijing as a rightful part of its territory. The United States recognizes the People’s Republic of China on the mainland as the sole legitimate government of China and doesn’t regard Taiwan as a country. But it doesn’t accept the Chinese Communist Party’s claim of sovereignty over the democratic island. While it offers Taiwan the means of self defense when it buys US made weapons, Washington has adopted a policy of purposeful vagueness over whether it would itself defend Taiwan, partly to deter a declaration of independence from Taipei and to give leaders in Beijing second thoughts about a forceful takeover of the island.  Robert Daly, a former US diplomat in Beijing, said Monday that China’s eventual response – perhaps, for example, an incursion into Taiwanese airspace, was unlikely to cause a war but would push the rivals closer to a danger zone.  “That will set up a new baseline that leads us slightly closer to confrontation,” Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “I don’t think that we will be at confrontation this time around, but I don’t think we will be better off in our relations with Beijing a week from now than we are today.” Why Biden worries about the trip Biden has reorganized US foreign policy around the principle of countering China’s growing might in Asia and further afield. Thirty years ago, Washington hoped that by encouraging then-reclusive China into the global economy it could promote political liberalization and usher it into the Western-oriented global economic and political system. But Beijing has sought to use its rising military and political power and influence to build an alternative political and economic value system to the one represented by the US and its allies.  But Biden also wants to manage this new competitive relationship so that it does not result in war between the rising power in the Pacific (China) and the existing one (the United States) and its allies.   The US leader stressed in a telephone call with Xi last week that there has been no change to the fundamental nature of US-China relations or the position of the White House when it comes to Taiwan. Yet seen from Beijing, Biden’s repeated recent statements that the US would defend Taiwan, which were all walked back by aides, may have left an impression that he is not sincere.  China is also watching a growing movement among hawks in Congress for Washington to replace the policy of “strategic ambiguity” over US intentions if China invades Taiwan for a clear statement that the US would defend the island.  Some analysts say such a shift could not only risk dragging the United States into a war in the Pacific against China that Americans are not prepared for, but that it could also make Beijing even more aggressive. Or that the promise of a US shield could embolden a push for independence in Taiwan that could also force China’s hand and bring a broader military conflict over the island closer. Ahead of Pelosi’s visit, official statements by administration officials firmly restated that there had been no change to US policy and affirmed her right to travel but hinted at the possibility of a rocky few weeks when China responds in whatever form. “There’s no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There’s no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,” the White House’s National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday. “We shouldn’t be, as a country, intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions.”  But in a new statement on Monday, Zhang Jun, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, warned again that China’s military would not “sit by idly” as Pelosi visits and that her trip would have an “egregious political impact.” The assumption in Washington is that Xi has no more interest in a direct military showdown than Biden does. But he’s stronger than previous Chinese leaders. And there is a strongly nationalist streak within the Chinese military along with growing confidence about its capacity.  So making assumptions about how China would respond to Pelosi’s visit based on its behavior in past crises that have blown over might mean the US is in for an unpleasant surprise.

661,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/trump-white-house-notes-toilet-photos-cnntv/,"""articleBody"":""Newly revealed photographs reveal two occasions on which former President Donald Trump apparently flushed documents down the toilet. Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter and CNN contributor, is publishing the new images in her forthcoming book, “Confidence Man,” and the images were earlier posted by Axios. CNN has previously reported how Trump flouted presidential record-keeping laws and would often tear up documents, drafts and memos after reading them. He periodically flushed papers down the toilet in the White House residence – only to be discovered later on when repairmen were summoned to fix the clogged toilets. Trump has denied the allegations, and in a statement given to Axios on Monday, a spokesman claimed that reporting about the practice was fabricated.  In the images revealed on Monday, it’s unclear what the documents are in reference to – and who authored them – but they appear to be written in Trump’s handwriting in black marker. Haberman said one image is from a White House toilet and the other one is from an overseas trip that was provided to her by a Trump White House source. “Who knows what this paper was? Only he would know and presumably whoever was dealing with it, but the important point is about the records,” Haberman told CNN’s John Berman and Brianna Keilar on “New Day” Monday morning.  Trump had a pattern of disregarding normal record preservation procedures. In one occasion, Trump asked if anyone wanted to put a copy of a speech he just delivered up for auction on eBay, during a mid-flight visit to the press cabin Air Force One. In other instances, Trump would task aides with carrying boxes of unread memos, articles and tweet drafts aboard the presidential aircraft for him to review and then tear to shreds. A former senior Trump administration official said a deputy from the Office of Staff Secretary would usually come in to pull things out of the trash and take them off Trump’s desk after he left a room. A former White House official recalled that while document preservation was a key responsibility of the staff secretary, the rest of Trump’s senior staffers lacked the sense of their obligation to maintain records of papers that moved through the West Wing. Trump’s haphazard record-keeping was the subject of a drawn-out fight earlier this year between him and the National Archives, and the Justice Department has been investigating the matter."",",Maggie Haberman;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;John Berman,Office Of Staff;New York Times;White House;White House;White House;White House;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;National Archives,"TAX_FNCACT_DEPUTY,1961;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2496;WB_840_JUSTICE,2496;SANITATION,159;SANITATION,537;SANITATION,923;SANITATION,1148;MEDIA_MSM,206;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,206;TAX_FNCACT_REPAIRMEN,612;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,745;MILITARY,1714;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1354;LEADER,101;LEADER,852;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,101;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,852;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,101;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,852;LEGISLATION,419;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,556;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1141;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1235;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,2122;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,296;TAX_FNCACT_AIDES,1763;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1947;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2131;TAX_FNCACT_STAFFERS,2257;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,1089;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1996;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2221;",White House;Washington;New York
130,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/joe-biden-abortion-executive-order/,"""articleBody"":""President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order to help ensure access to abortion in light of the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer to eliminate the constitutional right to the procedure. The President said the order helps women travel out of state to receive abortions, ensures health care providers comply with federal law so women aren’t delayed in getting care and advances research and data collection “to evaluate the impact that this reproductive health crisis is having on maternal health and other health conditions and outcomes.” Biden spoke of the “chaos and uncertainty” that has ensued in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision and said, “Women’s health and lives are on the line.” “Emergency medical care being denied to women experiencing miscarriages, doctors uncertain about what they can do to provide for their patients, pharmacists unsure whether they can fill prescriptions that they’ve always filled before, a tragic case of rape survivors, including a 10-year-old girl forced to travel to another state for care,” Biden said before signing the order.  The order comes the day after Kansas voters handed abortion-rights advocates a massive victory and defeating a measure that would have allowed the GOP-led legislature to impose new restrictions. It was a vote that Biden celebrated at the White House. “In a decisive victory, voters made it clear that politicians should not interfere with the fundamental rights of women. And the voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall the American people will vote to preserve and protect the right and refuse to let them be ripped away by politicians,” Biden said at the event. “And my administration has their back.” Biden signed the executive order during the inaugural meeting of the administration’s recently established Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, which is comprised of representatives from multiple departments across the federal government. Cabinet members briefed the President on steps their respective agencies have taken to defend reproductive rights.  The order directs Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to consider “all appropriate actions to ensure health care providers comply with federal non-discrimination laws so that women receive medically necessary care without delay,” including steps to provide health care providers with technical and legal guidance amid the patchwork of state legal restrictions on abortion care following the Supreme Court’s decision.  Last month, CNN reported doctors have struggled to navigate byzantine guidance as states across the country pass increasingly strict abortion restrictions, with experts warning of “an enormous chilling effect” on doctors performing miscarriage surgeries even when doctors “are confident that what they’re doing is within the letter of the law.” Wednesday’s order also directs HHS to consider actions guaranteeing women traveling across state lines seeking abortions have access to health care services, including through Medicaid. Last month, a bill guaranteeing women the right to travel across state lines to seek abortions failed to pass the Senate after Republicans blocked the measure. According to a senior administration official, that would allow states to provide care for out-of-state patients seeking abortions through a Medicaid 1115 waiver, permitting states to waive certain state-based requirements in providing care and assist in covering “certain costs.”  The executive order further directs HHS to expand research efforts on maternal health data, “to accurately measure the impact that diminishing access to reproductive health care services has on women’s health,” the official said Tuesday. Pressed Wednesday on how the president’s executive order on reproductive care avoids running afoul of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to perform abortions, White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said the Department of Health and Human Services will “come up with the details on the specifics on how they’re gonna work with states” to provide care via Medicaid waivers. “So, as you know, Medicaid provides comprehensive health care to women with low incomes – this care includes family planning services such as contraception, non-emergency medical, transportation, and support services like targeted case management, which allows health care providers to help patients coordinate their care,” Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee. “And it also includes abortion care in certain circumstances, as accepted by the Hyde Amendment, which is rape, incest and life of the mother.” The executive order, Jean-Pierre told Lee, “will cover care that is otherwise part of Medicaid,” including non-emergency medical travel and other health care services. She added, “The Hyde Amendment is law and we’re gonna, we’re gonna follow that law.” Wednesday’s executive order is the second one signed by Biden in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Last month, Biden signed an order that he said would safeguard access to abortion care and contraceptives, protect patient privacy and establish an interagency task force to use “every federal tool available to protect access to reproductive health care.” Ultimately, however, there is no action the President can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, and Biden has publicly acknowledged that his options to expand abortion access remain limited.

663,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/biden-china-taiwan-drills/,"""articleBody"":""President Joe Biden said Monday he was concerned about China’s recent military exercises around Taiwan but that he didn’t believe China would take additional action as it escalates tensions following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit.  China has spent several days conducting military drills that have essentially encircled Taiwan and restricted access to civilian ships and aircraft in the area. The extensive exercises mark a significant escalation by China after Pelosi’s trip to Taipei to show support for democracy on the island, which prompted outrage from Beijing. China views Taiwan as its territory despite never having controlled it.  “I’m not worried, but I’m concerned that they’re moving as much as they are. But I don’t think they’re going to do anything more,” Biden told reporters on Monday before departing for Kentucky.  Tensions continue to escalate in the region as China floods the seas and skies around Taiwan with ships and jets and conducts live-fire drills and missile launches. In addition to the drills, Beijing has canceled future phone calls between Chinese and US defense leaders, suspended bilateral climate talks and sanctioned Pelosi and her immediate family. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday Beijing’s military drills are “provocative, irresponsible and raise the risk of miscalculation.”  “We condemn these actions, we have, we’ve been condemning them since they started escalating and we’ve also said we anticipated China might take this step,” Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One.  The White House on Thursday summoned China’s ambassador to condemn the military activities and to stress the US’ wish to avoid a crisis in the region. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said the US reiterated there had been no change to the US’ “One China” policy and that Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China.  The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, and is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. But it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” Pelosi’s trip came at a low point in US-China relations and in the face of warnings from the Biden administration against a visit to the democratically governed island. Pelosi has said her visit, which was the first time a US House speaker had visited Taiwan in 25 years, was intended to make it clear the US would “not abandon” Taipei."",",Karine Jean-Pierre;John Kirby;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden,White House;White House;National Security Council;Cnn,"EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2187;MEDIA_MSM,997;MEDIA_MSM,1753;DELAY,1257;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,1319;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1939;TAX_FNCACT_PRESS_SECRETARY,1429;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,1829;USPEC_POLICY1,2072;USPEC_POLICY1,2445;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,2072;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,2445;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,698;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,797;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,698;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,797;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1939;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1939;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1939;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1939;MILITARY,1770;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,290;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1181;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1227;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1491;DEMOCRACY,520;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,520;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1906;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,212;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,2713;LEADER,14;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,14;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,14;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,1331;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2136;LEGISLATION,2276;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2276;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,1959;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1108;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1413;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1791;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,1099;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1298;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2425;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1298;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2425;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1429;",White House;Taiwan;Republic Of China;Chinese;Washington;Kentucky;Beijing;Taipei;China

Pelosi is leading a Congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific and plans to visit places including Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, according to a statement released by her office on Sunday. The statement made no mention of Taiwan, despite speculation in recent days that Pelosi might be planning to visit the self-governing democracy of 24 million people. China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory – despite never having controlled it – has warned against Pelosi visiting the island, and US President Joe Biden recently let slip that the US military thinks such a trip would be “not a good idea right now”. However, US lawmakers on both sides of Washington’s political divide have urged her to go. “Today, our Congressional delegation travels to the Indo-Pacific to reaffirm America’s strong and unshakeable commitment to our allies and friends in the region,” Pelosi said in the statement released by her office.  She said high level meetings will be held in each country to “further advance our shared interests and values, including peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance.” Pelosi said the delegation had received a briefing from United States Indo-Pacific Command leadership after a fuel stop in Hawaii, where they visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial and the USS Arizona. Traveling alongside Pelosi as part of the Congressional delegation are Chairman Gregory Meeks (Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Chairman Mark Takano (Chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs), Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Congressman Andy Kim. “Under the strong leadership of President Biden, America is firmly committed to smart, strategic engagement in the region, understanding that a free and flourishing Indo-Pacific is crucial to prosperity in our nation and around the globe,” Pelosi said."",",Raja Krishnamoorthi;Gregory Meeks;Suzan Delbene;Andy Kim;Mark Takano;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden,China Communist Party;House Committee On Veteran Affairs;House Foreign Affairs Committee,"TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2029;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2065;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,227;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,968;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1831;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,227;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,968;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,1831;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,911;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1529;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,858;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,858;TAX_FNCACT_VETERAN,1977;EPU_ECONOMY,1461;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1461;GENERAL_HEALTH,1500;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1500;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1500;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1500;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1500;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1500;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1500;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1500;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,579;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1514;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1491;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSWOMAN,2001;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1855;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1925;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,585;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1536;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1536;DEMOCRACY,541;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,541;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,30;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1521;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1560;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1560;LEADER,730;LEADER,2118;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,730;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2118;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,1468;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,1521;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,1521;",Japan;Hawaii;Taiwan;Hong Kong;Singapore;United States;Arizona;America;Washington;Malaysia;South Korea;Pearl Harbor;China
372,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/media/alex-jones-sandy-hook-trial/,"""articleBody"":""The parents of a child who was murdered during the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting delivered emotional testimony in a Texas court on Tuesday, telling a jury that the lies pushed by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones have stained the legacy of their son and tormented them for years. The jury hearing the case will determine how much in damages Jones will have to pay the parents, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, who won a default judgement against him earlier this year. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis asked the jury last week to award Heslin and Lewis $150 million.  Fighting back tears at times, Heslin told the jury that Jones, through his conspiratorial media organization Infowars, “tarnished the honor and legacy” of his son. Heslin said that he couldn’t “even begin to describe the last nine-and-a-half years of hell” he has endured because of Jones. “There’s got to be a strong deterrent that shall prevent him from peddling this propaganda,” Heslin said, adding that through his testimony he wanted “to restore my credibility, my reputation, and Jesse’s legacy that he so much deserves.” As Heslin testified, a television screen in the court showed a photograph of his murdered son, six-year-old Jesse Lewis. Jones, who is expected to testify in his own defense later on Tuesday, was absent from the courtroom during Heslin’s testimony and the first part of Lewis’ testimony. Heslin called that absence “a cowardly act.” “I’ve been here for a week and a half and [during] my final testimony Mr. Alex Jones does not have the courage to sit in front of me or face me,” Heslin said. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis told CNN the two have needed to be in isolation and under the protection of professional security during the trial. Heslin also said on the stand that the lie pushed by Jones “resonates around the world” and that he has realized “how dangerous” it is. Heslin described being repeatedly confronted by those who believed Jones over the last ten years, saying such interactions occur “right up to this day.” “My life has been threatened,” Heslin said. “I fear for my life. I fear for my safety and my family’ safety and their life.” ‘Jesse was real. I’m a real mom’ In a remarkable moment in court, Lewis directly spoke to Jones, who was in the courtroom after the trial broke for lunch. She said that she wanted to address Jones to his face. “Jesse was real,” Lewis told Jones. “I’m a real mom.” Lewis told Jones that she thinks he didn’t actually believe the lies he pushed about Sandy Hook. “That’s the problem, I know you know that,” Lewis told Jones. “But you keep saying it. Why? Why? For money?” Lewis said that “having a six-year-old son shot in the forehead” while at school is an “unbearable pain.” “And then to have someone on top of that perpetuate a lie that it was a hoax, that it didn’t happen, that it was a false flag, and that I was an actress — You think I’m an actress?” Lewis asked. Lewis told the jury that monetary damages were appropriate in the case because she doesn’t believe Jones will ever stop. “There has not been a sincere apology,” she said. “But if there was, ever, I liken it to being in a car accident and you run over someone and cause tremendous bodily damage and you look at that person lying on the ground and say, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m not accountable for any of the damage I just caused. But I’m sorry.’ That’s how I see it.” Regardless, Lewis said that she does not believe Jones understands the repercussions “of going on air with a huge audience and lying and calling this a hoax.” “It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this,” Lewis told Jones. “That we have to implore you — not just implore you, punish you — to get you to stop lying…It is surreal what is going on in here.” Lewis also testified in court that she has been harassed and received death threats, including at her own home, all of which she said reopens the wounds surrounding her son’s murder. “The fear and anxiety and unsafeness … keeps me from healing,” Lewis said. “It definitely negatively impacts the healing process.” Lewis described the conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook as “deeply unsettling.” “I feel compromised,” Lewis said, describing how she feels about her own personal safety. Roy Lubit, a forensic psychiatrist who was hired to conduct an examination of Heslin and Lewis, testified to the court on Monday how terrified and worried for their personal safety the two parents are.  Lubit told the court that Lewis and Heslin “are very, very frightened.” When asked to specify who they are frightened of, Lubit responded, “Some follower of Jones trying to kill them.” Lubit elaborated that Lewis sleeps with a gun, a knife, and pepper spray on her night stand. Lubit added she won’t even turn on the air conditioning during hot days for fear of not being able to hear an intruder possibly coming to hurt her.  Lewis testified Tuesday that she owns a gun to keep her other son safe, telling the jury that she failed to keep one son safe and will do everything in her power to ensure that no harm happens to her other child. ‘This is not your show’ Jones took the stand in the afternoon, telling the court he felt “good” because he was being afforded the opportunity to push back against the plaintiffs and news media. From the stand, Jones told Heslin and Lewis, “I never intentionally tried to hurt you.” Jones said “the internet had a lot of questions” about the Sandy Hook shooting, and so did he. Jones argued he simply had “tried to find out what actually happened.” After the jury had left the courtroom following Jones’ testimony, Mark Bankston, the attorney for the plaintiffs, accused Jones and his attorney, Federico Andino Reynal, of trying to “poison” the trial. Bankston said that they would file a motion for sanctions against both Jones and Reynal. Bankston specifically said Jones broke court orders when he attempted to discuss his net worth from the stand. “Mr. Jones just intentionally did that in violation of your order to attempt to poison this compensatory damage verdict to try to tell this jury that he’s broke, and he’s not, and that’s in violation of your order,” Bankston said to the judge. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said she will hear any motions officially filed for sanctions against Jones and Reynal after the conclusion of the trial. But Gamble admonished Jones for his behavior and said he had already violated his oath to tell the truth twice. “Mr. Jones, you may not say to this jury that you complied with discovery. That is not true. You may not say it again. You may not tell this jury that you are bankrupt. That is also not true,” Gamble said. “You are already under oath to tell the truth,” Gamble added. “You’ve already violated that oath twice today, in just those two examples. It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify. Yet here I am again.” “This is not your show,” Gamble added. Jones attempted to tell Gamble that he believed he was telling the truth. “You believe everything you say is true, but your beliefs do not make something true,” Gamble said. “That is that is what we’re doing here. Just because you claim to think something is true does not make it true. It does not protect you. It is not allowed. You’re under oath. That means things must actually be true when you say them.” At the conclusion of court proceedings, Lewis walked over to Jones and handed him a bottle of water because he had complained about having trouble speaking due to a torn larynx. Jones started talking to Lewis and Heslin and the exchange with Heslin grew heated. An attorney for Heslin and Lewis interjected, telling Jones as he escorted his clients out of the courtroom, “That’s not even a thought. That’s not the way this goes.” Jones shouted back, “Why because you can’t feed them fake videos anymore?” Other legal developments Jones has lashed out at the judicial proceedings taking place, baselessly claiming last week that he was being tried in Texas before a “kangaroo court.” Infowars has also published content attacking the judges overseeing the cases in vicious terms. Jones’ media company, Free Speech Systems, which is the company that operates Infowars, filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday. Jury selection for a similar trial involving Jones and Sandy Hook families commenced on Tuesday in Connecticut, where Jones was also found liable for damages earlier this year. But jury selection was suspended after Jones’ attorneys filed documents in federal court to remove the case for now due to Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy filing. Attorneys representing some Sandy Hook families have accused Jones of having drained Free Speech Systems of assets in recent years as part of an effort to protect himself from potential judgements he may be ordered to pay. One of the attorneys, Avi Moshenberg, told CNN on Tuesday that the bankruptcy filing made by Free Speech Systems indicated that $62 million in assets had been withdrawn from the company in 2021 and 2022. “If you look at the bankruptcy filing, leading up to the declaration of bankruptcy, Alex Jones, the sole owner [of Free Speech Systems], took $62 million in draws in 2021 and 2022,” Moshenberg told CNN. “Just straight up draws. That’s why the company has few assets.” A lawyer representing Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday morning. But a hearing is scheduled on Wednesday in which W. Marc Schwartz, the chief restructuring officer for Free Speech Systems, is expected to testify.

458,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/minnesota-morning-after-pill-verdict/,"""articleBody"":""A jury in Aitkin County, Minnesota, on Friday found that a pharmacy did not discriminate against a woman by refusing to fill her emergency contraception prescription, court records show. However, the jury found the pharmacist did cause the woman emotional harm in the amount of $25,000. According to the original complaint, Andrea Anderson, a mother and a licensed foster parent, obtained a prescription in January 2019 for Ella – otherwise known as the “morning after pill” or emergency contraception – after her regular contraception failed. Her doctor sent the prescription to the McGregor Pharmacy, but the pharmacist on duty, George Badeaux, told Anderson that he would be unable to fill her prescription because of his “beliefs.” Badeaux “did not clarify what his beliefs were or why they interfered with his ability to perform his job as a medical professional,” according to the complaint.  Anderson eventually found a pharmacy that was willing to fill her prescription – after driving over 100 miles round trip in a snowstorm, the complaint stated. Badeaux’s attorney Charles Shreffler said in a statement he and his client were “incredibly happy with the jury’s decision.” “Medical professionals should be free to practice their profession in line with their beliefs,” the statement said. “Mr. Badeaux is unable to participate in any procedure that requires him to dispense drugs that have the potential to end innocent human life in the womb. Every American should have the freedom to operate according to their ethical and religious beliefs. Doctors, pharmacists, and other medical providers are no different.” CNN has reached out to attorneys for the pharmacy for comment. Gender Justice, the advocacy group representing Anderson, had argued that denying Anderson service based on her reproductive health care needs was illegal sex discrimination and violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act. The group said it would appeal the jury’s decision to the state’s Court of Appeals. “To be clear, the law in Minnesota prohibits sex discrimination and that includes refusing to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception,” Gender Justice Legal Director Jess Braverman said. “The jury was not deciding what the law is, they were deciding the facts of what happened here in this particular case. We will appeal this decision and won’t stop fighting until Minnesotans can get the health care they need without the interference of providers putting their own personal beliefs ahead of their legal and ethical obligations to their patients.” Since a major pharmaceutical business deal in 2017, the so-called morning after pill has become America’s most widely used over-the-counter emergency contraception. Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, there are fears that some types of birth control won’t be available, and demand for longer-lasting birth control and emergency contraception, including the morning-after pill, has grown. Correction: An earlier version of this story contained a photo of the headquarters of a pharmacy chain that is not affiliated with the defendant in the lawsuit. It has been removed. The story has also been updated to make clear the defendant pharmacy’s name and to whom CNN reached out for comment. The story also misspelled the name of the county where the pharmacy is located. It is in Aitkin County.

330,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/parkland-shooting-cruz-sentencing-trial/,"""articleBody"":""Jurors in the sentencing phase of the Parkland, Florida, school shooter’s trial on Thursday visited the scene of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s 1200 building, which has been sealed since the attack on February 14, 2018.  They saw bloodstains where the victims were shot and killed, according to a group of reporters allowed to enter after jurors completed their walk-through. Valentine’s Day gifts and cards littered the scene, and bullet holes were in the walls. Fragments of broken safety glass lay everywhere, the reporters wrote, crunching beneath their feet.  The visit, Judge Elizabeth Scherer explained to jurors Wednesday, was meant to help them analyze the evidence presented so far in the trial of Nikolas Cruz, who faces either the death penalty or life in prison after pleading guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder.  The state rested its case Thursday afternoon, after jurors returned from the visit and prosecutors called several more witnesses to offer victim impact statements.  Pool footage taken from outside the building Thursday showed it remained fenced off, hidden in part behind banners that carried the high school’s name and the emblem of its eagle mascot. The judge, prosecutors and defense attorneys were also seen entering the building.        Jurors were instructed Wednesday to “avoid touching, manipulating or moving anything.” The judge also told them to explore the scene on their own and at their own pace, moving as a group from floor to floor. Cruz did not attend the visit, telling the judge Thursday morning in response to her questioning that it was his decision not to go.  “Nothing will be explained or pointed out to you,” the judge’s instructions said. Jurors were also told to avoid speaking to anyone until the viewing was complete. On the first floor, there was dried blood outside room 1215 where three students were killed, per the reporters who went inside. In room 1214, a Holocaust studies class, were two yellowed copies of the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. Bullet marks marred the desks, and laptops sat open. In room 1216, a blue folder with Alaina Petty’s name sat on a desk, the reporters wrote. Bullet holes were seen in the wall, and the reporters noted a handwritten paper about Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban for advocating for educational access for girls and women.  “We go to school every day of the week and we take it all for granted,” one student wrote. “We cry and complain without knowing how lucky we are to be able to learn.”  On the second floor, in room 1230, the reporters saw a heart-shaped box of Valentine’s Day chocolates. In room 1232, there were calculators still on school desks and open spiral notebooks where students were doing algebra. Bloodstains from more victims were seen on the third floor, they wrote, along with bullet scrapes along the wall and bullet holes in windows. In room 1255, the white board read, “How to write the perfect love letter” – the creative writing assignment for the day. In 1249, the reporters saw an unfinished chess game.   Patricia Oliver, mother of victim Joaquin Oliver, told CNN that she hoped “emotions” would be the jurors’ main takeaway after visiting the building Thursday, which would have been her son’s 22nd birthday. The building was closed to preserve it for the trial. Officials have said it will be torn down.  “We were, of course, knowing that this moment will arrive. It’s a moment that is part of a process,” said Manuel Oliver, Joaquin’s father, now an activist and organizer who addresses gun violence. “The most important thing here is what happened to our son, the way he suffered that day and what are we capable of doing after that. That’s what really matters here.” Jurors were not allowed to have a smartphone, smartwatch or any type of camera during the viewing. In court, attorneys encouraged the judge to ask jurors to wear closed-toe shoes because they could encounter glass on the floor.   ‘I can’t truly be happy if I smile,’ victim’s father testifies The current phase of the trial is to determine Cruz’s sentence: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while Cruz’s defense attorneys are asking the jury for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. To recommend a death sentence, jurors must be unanimous. If they do so, the judge could choose to follow the recommendation or sentence Cruz to life instead. Following the visit, more victim impact statements were presented in court, with more of the victims’ families taking the stand to testify about the toll of the massacre and what their loved ones’ deaths have meant for them.  “I just can’t seem to really enjoy anything the way that I used to,” said Debra Hixon, the wife of athletic director Chris Hixon, who died trying to disarm the gunman. “The house that we shared doesn’t feel like the home that we built, because home meant Chris.”  Anne Ramsay, mother of 17-year-old victim Helena Ramsay, remembered her daughter as a beautiful and graceful young woman – someone who was naturally athletic but who preferred exercising her mind to competitive sport. She loved watching “Jeopardy!” Helena was killed on her father’s birthday, Anne Ramsay said. “That day will never be a celebration, and can never be the same for him,” she said, “and now is filled with pain, as is every day.” In a statement read by her niece, Hui Wang, the mother of Peter Wang, a 15-year-old shot as he held open a door to help his classmates get to safety, recalled how he was killed just before Chinese New Year, robbing the family of their most treasured holiday. “We no longer decorate our house or host feasts on the most important holiday in our family. It is now Peter’s death anniversary,” the statement, read by Wang’s cousin Lin Chen read. “This day of unity became a day that hurts the most.”   Much of the testimony in the Broward County court this week – particularly from the parents of the 14 students killed – has focused on all the things the victims and their families will never get to do and the irreparable damage to their everyday lives.  “Our family is broken. There is this constant emptiness,” said Max Schachter, the father of 14-year-old Alex, who loved chocolate chip cookies, playing the trombone and video games.  “I feel I can’t truly be happy if I smile,” Schachter said Wednesday. “I know that behind that smile is the sharp realization that part of me will always be sad and miserable because Alex isn’t here.” The loss of her daughter Meadow Pollack, 18, has “destroyed” Shara Kaplan’s life, she told the jury Tuesday, “and my capability of ever living a productive existence.” To articulate how her daughter’s death impacted her, she said, she would have to rip out her heart and show them how it had shattered into a million pieces. And the Hoyer family will never be the same. “We were a family unit of five always trying to fit into a world set up for even numbers,” said Tom Hoyer, whose 15-year-old son Luke – the youngest of three – was killed. “Two-, four-, six-seat tables in a restaurant. Two-, four-, six-ticket packages to events. Things like that.” But the Hoyers are no longer a family of five, and “never again will the world feel right, now that we’re a family of four,” Hoyer said. “When Luke died something went missing in me,” he said. “And I’ll never, never get over that feeling.” To make their sentencing decision, jurors will hear prosecutors and defense attorneys argue aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances – reasons Cruz should or should not be executed.  The victim impact statements add another layer, giving the families and friends of the victims their own day in court, though the judge told the jury the statements are not meant to be weighed as aggravating factors.

214,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/entertainment/nichelle-nichols-star-trek-dies/,"""articleBody"":""Actress and singer Nichelle Nichols, best known for her groundbreaking portrayal of Lt. Nyota Uhura in “Star Trek: The Original Series,” has died at age 89, according to a statement from her son, Kyle Johnson.  “Last night, my mother, Nichelle Nichols, succumbed to natural causes and passed away. Her light however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain for us and future generations to enjoy, learn from, and draw inspiration,” Johnson said in a statement shared to Nichols’ official site on Sunday. “Hers was a life well lived and as such a model for us all.” Nichols died from natural causes, he said. Nichols portrayed communications officer Lt. Nyota Uhura in the “Star Trek” TV series and many of its film offshoots.  When “Star Trek” began in 1966, Nichols was a television rarity: a Black woman in a notable role on a prime-time television series. There had been African-American women on TV before, but they often played domestic workers and had small roles; Nichols’ Uhura was an integral part of the multicultural “Star Trek” crew.  The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called it “the first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a Black woman in television history.”  Nichols is widely known for participating in one of the first interracial kisses on US television when her character kissed James T. Kirk, portrayed by White Canadian actor William Shatner. In an interview with CNN in 2014, Nichols said the kiss scene “changed television forever, and it also changed the way people looked at one another.” After “Trek’s” three-season run, Nichols dedicated herself to the space program. She helped NASA in making the agency more diverse, helping to recruit astronauts Sally Ride, Judith Resnik and Guion Bluford, among others. George Takei, who portrayed the USS Enterprise’s helmsman Hikaru Sulu, posted a touching tribute to his co-star. “I shall have more to say about the trailblazing, incomparable Nichelle Nichols, who shared the bridge with us as Lt. Uhura of the USS Enterprise, and who passed today at age 89,” wrote Takei on Twitter. “For today, my heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend.” “We lived long and prospered together,” he added with a photo of the pair making the iconic Vulcan salute.  The National Air and Space Museum called Nichols “an inspiration to many, not just for her groundbreaking work on Star Trek but also through her work with NASA to recruit women and people of color to apply to become astronauts” on Twitter. Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, also posted a tribute to the actress. “Godspeed to Nichelle Nichols, champion, warrior and tremendous actor,” wrote Abrams on Twitter alongside a photo of herself with Nichols. “Her kindness and bravery lit the path for many. May she forever dwell among the stars.” Nichols was born Grace Dell Nichols near Chicago in 1932. (Unhappy with Grace, she took the name Nichelle when she was a teenager.) Her grandfather was a White Southerner who married a Black woman, causing a rift in his family.  Blessed with a four-octave vocal range, Nichols was performing in local clubs by the time she was 14. Among the performers she met was Duke Ellington, who later took her on tour. She also worked extensively in Chicago clubs and in theater.  She moved to Los Angeles in the early ’60s and landed a role in a Gene Roddenberry series, “The Lieutenant.” A number of “Star Trek” veterans, including Leonard Nimoy, Walter Koenig and Majel Barrett, also worked on the show.  When Roddenberry was creating “Trek,” he remembered Nichols. She was in Europe when she got the call.  “(My agent said), ‘They’re doing ‘Star Trek,’ and I didn’t know what a ‘Star Trek’ was,” she said in an interview with the Television Academy. Uhura wasn’t in the original script, and Nichols was responsible for the name. She was reading a book called “Uhuru” – “freedom” in Swahili – and suggested her character take the name. Roddenberry thought it was too harsh.  “I said, ‘Well, why don’t you do an alteration of it, soften the end with an ‘A,’ and it’ll be Uhura?’ ” she recalled. “He said, ‘That’s it, that’s your name! You named it; it’s yours.’ ”  Nichols is survived by her son, Kyle Johnson."",",Judith Resnik;William Shatner;Dell Nichols;Nichol Uhura;Guion Bluford;Majel Barrett;Hikaru Sulu;Los Angeles;Leonard Nimoy;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nyota Uhura;Nyota Uhura;Stacey Abrams;Martin Luther King Jr;Duke Ellington;Sally Ride;George Takei;Walter Koenig;Kyle Johnson;Kyle Johnson;Gene Roddenberry,Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Space Museum;Cnn;Cnn;Television Academy,"MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1771;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2658;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1001;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1349;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,3404;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,1545;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,3041;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_COMMUNICATIONS_OFFICER,850;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNICATIONS_OFFICER,850;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_LIEUTENANT,3796;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT,3796;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,2921;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3827;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,21;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1091;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,2806;KILL,149;KILL,776;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,149;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,776;TAX_FNCACT_AGENT,4026;MARITIME_INCIDENT,2141;MARITIME,2141;MEDIA_MSM,886;MEDIA_MSM,1097;TAX_ETHNICITY_SWAHILI,4284;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SWAHILI,4284;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2240;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2865;MEDIA_SOCIAL,3067;RECRUITMENT,1851;RECRUITMENT,2800;DEMOCRACY,2899;TAX_ETHNICITY_CANADIAN,1539;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,12;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,2971;TAX_FNCACT_KING,1276;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1143;TAX_FNCACT_HELMSMAN,1980;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,850;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,850;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,689;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,995;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,1343;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,3398;",Georgia;Canadian;American;Chicago

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. How is it already August? It feels like summer is just speeding by, and I haven’t done even half of the things I wanted to do. What I have done in spades, though, is catch some really good streaming content. Settle in on the sofa for this week’s first offering, but be forewarned that some of its festive scenes may get you in the mood to jump up and bust some moves.   Three things to watch  ‘Wedding Season’ Many of us know about the pressure on single folks to get married. So the plot of this new film, in which two young professionals pretend to be a couple during summer wedding season to get their parents off their back, resonates. Of course, we know what happens as a result. Love a romantic comedy!  It’s streaming on Netflix. ‘Mike Judge’s Beavis and Butt-Head’ It’s the revival you may not have even known you needed. Our favorite airheaded teens have traveled from the 1990s to 2022, and we get a chance to enjoy their shenanigans yet again. There are some updates, of course, but the guys are still just as dim-witted as ever. Get ready for the nostalgia and the fun. The new series, which follows on the heels of the Paramount+ movie “Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe,” is streaming on the same platform. ‘Sweet Life: Los Angeles’ Season 2  Issa Rae is always giving us a slice of African American life. This reality series follows a group of young, ambitious Black friends who are pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. Naturally, it’s not all a bed of roses — it is television, after all — but this coming-of-age show offers lots of opportunity to witness growth. The second season of “Sweet Life: Los Angeles” is streaming on HBO Max, which is owned by CNN’s parent company. Two things to listen to Calvin Harris could have a music festival just with the artists featured on his latest project. “Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2” features collaborations with the likes of Justin Timberlake, Dua Lipa, Normani, Offset, Halsey, Pharrell and Snoop Dogg, to name a few. “I felt like the first one, the idea was there, but I didn’t fully carry it through,” the DJ/producer told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, as reported by Complex. “With this one, I wanted to have more live drums, guitars … I wanted the original essence. I wanted the layers and the grit and the dirt. And I don’t want things to be mixed too perfectly.” The album dropped Friday. Slim Shady has hits. Eminem is releasing “Curtain Call 2,” the second volume of his greatest hits. The album is “a hits collection comprised of the inimitable Detroit MC’s creative output since the 2005 release of Curtain Call: The Hits,” according to the rapper’s site.  “Curtain Call 2” will include music from all Eminem projects starting from 2009’s “Relapse,” including songs from various side projects, guest appearances and film soundtracks. His performance during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show has me so ready for this release, out now.  One thing to talk about The news that Zahara Jolie-Pitt will be attending Spelman College in Atlanta is quite a boon to HBCUs. As the daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, the teen had her choice of schools. And by choosing one of the best known of the historically Black colleges and universities to matriculate at, she brings a great deal of attention to the liberal arts college. Her mother proudly announced Jolie-Pitt’s choice on social media, and the excitement for her was palpable. I get it, as I count several Spelman graduates as good friends. A supportive sisterhood awaits Jolie-Pitt. Good luck to her and all the incoming freshmen across the nation this semester.  Something to sip on  Inclusion isn’t just about race. That’s the lesson that resonates with Beyoncé’s agreeing to remove an ableist slur from her latest hit album, “Renaissance.” After complaints that the song “Heated” contained a term that is derogatory to people with spastic cerebral palsy, reps for the singer confirmed that “the word, not used intentionally in a harmful way, will be replaced.” It’s a lesson that Lizzo also learned in a similar situation in June. She, too, was quick to rectify the issue.  Addressing these concerns goes beyond good public relations. It’s an example to us all about the need for sensitivity. \n\nWhat did you like about today’s newsletter? What did we miss?

614,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/car-drives-through-new-mexico-parade-gallup/,"""articleBody"":""An SUV driver who on Thursday evening allegedly struck people along a parade route in Gallup, New Mexico, has been accused of aggravated DWI and other charges, according to the New Mexico State Police. In total, 15 people with non-life-threatening injuries were transported to hospitals from the Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial Centennial Celebration event, state police officials said Friday in a news release. Gallup police were told several people in a Chevrolet Tahoe parked along the route of the Ceremonial Night Parade were drinking alcohol, according to state police. As officers approached the SUV, the driver took off and both officers were injured, state police said. “The Tahoe continued eastbound on West Coal Avenue toward parade participants while officers attempted to move spectators out of the Tahoe’s path,” the release says. A video taken by witness Sean Justice shows a group of people performing in the street when the crowd burst into screams, with people leaping up and rushing in the opposite direction of what appears to be a moving SUV. A statement from Gallup city officials said the SUV hit pedestrians, vehicles and a business before it was stopped. Another video captured by witness Keisha Joe shows what appears to be the SUV which was driven through the parade. In front of the SUV is a damaged car on the sidewalk, its front door crumpled in.  A 33-year-old man who was allegedly driving was arrested and is accused of aggravated DWI, one count of accident involving injury/great bodily harm, 14 counts of accident involving injury/not great bodily harm and other charges, according to state police. The man, a resident of Pinedale, had a suspended/revoked license, the news release said. Authorities said there is no evidence of a hate crime. The two male passengers in the SUV were taken to the Gallup Detox Center. “We are deeply saddened by this incident. We encourage everyone to attend the remaining Gallup Inter-Tribal Ceremonial events,” city officials said. “The city is working with multiple agencies to ensure safety is of the highest priority.  We will begin healing together in this celebration of cultural connections.” The Gallup Intertribal Ceremony will continue as scheduled. Thursday was the first night of the 11-day-long event. Another parade is scheduled for August 13, according to the event website. “We’re incredibly saddened and shocked by the life-threatening and traumatic incident that took place last night when a vehicle drove through the Ceremonial Night Parade,” Melissa Sanchez, the executive director of the New Mexico Tourism Department Intertribal Ceremonial Office, said in the release. “We await as law enforcement continues to gather the facts regarding this ongoing situation. Right now, safety is the top priority for community members, participants, travelers, and event staff and volunteers.” Gallup is in northwestern New Mexico, a little more than a two-hour drive west of Albuquerque. It is home to the Navajo Regional Office Bureau of Indian Affairs. “We are thankful that no lives were lost due to this senseless act by a few individuals. The perpetrators must be held accountable to the fullest extent. My family and I, as well as many of our Navajo people, witnessed the tragic events firsthand,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a news release. “We saw children who were shedding tears and people shaking with fear and we did our best to comfort them and let them know that everything would be OK.” Navajo Nation Council Speaker Seth Damon released a statement saying, “The Navajo Nation stands with resilience against any acts of violence and sends prayers of protection to those affected. This was a traumatic and triggering event for many, especially for our youth, elders, and our veterans who acted quickly.” “Hold Gallup in your prayers tonight as we come together in faith and strength for one another. May the Creator and Holy People bless you all tonight as we move forward together,” he said. CNN’s Amanda Jackson, Tina Burnside and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.

20,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/california-mckinney-fire-monday/,"""articleBody"":""A wildfire in Northern California that exploded in size over the weekend has killed at least two people, forced thousands to evacuate and grown into the state’s largest wildfire this year, with lightning Monday threatening its further expansion. The McKinney Fire broke out Friday afternoon in the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border and has since ripped through more than 55,000 acres, advancing on homes and forcing nearly 2,000 residents to evacuate Saturday, authorities said.  The blaze has become California’s largest wildfire so far this year, Cal Fire Capt. Chris Bruno told CNN. Two people were found dead Sunday morning inside a vehicle that burned in the path of the fire, the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office said. The two were found on a residential driveway along Doggett Creek Road near Highway 96, the sheriff’s office posted Monday morning on Facebook. Officials have not released any more information on them. As the weekend ended, the blaze was 0% contained, and firefighters face a long battle ahead as lightning and thunderstorms complicated efforts while the flames raced through dry vegetation. Heavy smoke over the fire helped slow its growth Sunday but also kept firefighting aircraft grounded, the US Forest Service said in a Sunday night update. Oregon state Rep. Dacia Grayber her husband, both firefighters, were camping near the California state line when they woke up Saturday to orange skies, hot wind gusts, lightning and blowing ash, she said on Twitter. They evacuated from the campground knowing one of them may return on deployment if the fire grows. “In 22+ yrs of fire I’ve never experienced anything like this fire behavior at night. It felt absolutely surreal and not just a little apocalyptic,” Grayber tweeted. The fire is just one symptom of the American West’s historic drought and the human-caused climate change crisis, which has caused more frequent and more severe wildfires. California’s persistent drought conditions have set the scene for rapid fire spread in the forest, with the fires burning extremely dry, receptive fuels, according to the forest service. Sprinting through dry brush, grass and timber, the fire activity has been extreme, with the flames running uphill, and spotting further out, according to fire officials. “Klamath National Forest is a big and beautiful forest, but it also has some steep and rugged terrain. And with that, coupled with the high temperatures, low humidity, they all come into play and make it a very extreme fire danger situation right now,” Tom Stokesberry of the US Forest Service told CNN affiliate KTVL. Over 2 million under red flag warnings Monday The fire risk could intensify Monday. “Abundant lightning” is expected through Monday, as well as scattered thunderstorms, which could spread the flames out further, according to the National Weather Service. “These conditions can be extremely dangerous for firefighters, as winds can be erratic and extremely strong, causing fire to spread in any direction,” forest service officials said in a news release. Dry thunderstorms like those occurring over the weekend happen when rainfall evaporates before ever hitting the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. More than 2 million people are under red flag warnings Monday in parts of northern California, central Oregon, eastern Washington, Montana, eastern Wyoming, western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. And it isn’t the only blaze crews have to contend with. There were 10 different wildfires burning in the Klamath National Forest Sunday afternoon, forest officials said. The fires generated their own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are created from the intense heat of the fire forcing air to rise. Tor Mason was one of the hundreds evacuated due to the McKinney Fire. He and his friends fled their homes and arrived at the Klamath River Community Center, only to find the fire closing in, he told CNN affiliate KDRV. “When I got to the community center it was almost on fire. I’m like, “Holy crap, this isn’t good,” Mason said. “So I put the … pedal to the metal and I boogied. … I heard this morning it shot up in flames.” The fire left a path of destroyed vehicles, scorched structures and haze-filled skies along Highway 96, according to video recorded Saturday by Kirk Eadie, EMS manager for Happy Camp Ambulance. About 650 firefighting personnel have converged on the blaze, attacking the flames from the ground and the air and working to defend evacuated homes. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for Siskiyou County, saying the blaze has destroyed homes and threatened critical infrastructure. Cal Fire said no information was available on structures damaged by the McKinney Fire, though Stokesberry told KTVL there were unconfirmed reports of lost structures. On Saturday, about 60 people were evacuated from the Pacific Crest Trail as the McKinney Fire approached, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon said on its Facebook page, noting the hikers were rescued from the “California side of the Red Buttes Wilderness.” CNN’s Holly Yan, Eric Levenson, David Williams, Paradise Afshar, Tina Burnside, Amanda Jackson and Claire Colbert contributed to this report."",",Chris Bruno;Robert Shackelford;Robert Shackelford;Gavin Newsom;Dacia Grayber;Claire Colbert;Amanda Jackson;Tina Burnside;Tom Stokesberry,Twitter;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Facebook;Us Forest Service;Us Forest Service,"TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,2236;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,288;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,573;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1972;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2629;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2655;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3359;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3442;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3662;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3690;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3917;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,4049;WB_1777_FORESTS,288;WB_1777_FORESTS,573;WB_1777_FORESTS,1972;WB_1777_FORESTS,2629;WB_1777_FORESTS,2655;WB_1777_FORESTS,3359;WB_1777_FORESTS,3442;WB_1777_FORESTS,3662;WB_1777_FORESTS,3690;WB_1777_FORESTS,3917;WB_1777_FORESTS,4049;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,288;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,573;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1972;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2629;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2655;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3359;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3442;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3662;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3690;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3917;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4049;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,288;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,573;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1972;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2629;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2655;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3359;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3442;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3662;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3690;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3917;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4049;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,3960;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1130;WATER_SECURITY,3293;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,3293;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,15;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,132;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,830;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,911;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2430;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,15;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,132;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,830;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,911;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2430;POLITICAL_TURMOIL,4281;STATE_OF_EMERGENCY,4281;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,2832;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,3160;BORDER,321;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,4722;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,4722;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,4364;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,451;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,451;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,451;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2811;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4192;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,972;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,4739;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,2575;ARMEDCONFLICT,697;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,94;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,4467;AFFECT,428;EVACUATION,428;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,539;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,4105;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1178;DISASTER_FIRE,482;DISASTER_FIRE,1269;DISASTER_FIRE,2799;DISASTER_FIRE,3014;DISASTER_FIRE,3506;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1990;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2665;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3620;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,1509;NATURAL_DISASTER_STRONG_WINDS,1541;",Yreka;Siskiyou;Jackson County;Oregon;Red Buttes Wilderness;Klamath;California

Schwartz testified that Jones withdrew about $62 million dollars from the company over 14 years, and testified that $30 million of those withdrawals was paid to the IRS.  Schwartz also testified during the hearing, which ran for more than six hours, that Infowars received about $9 million in cryptocurrency donations and that “they went directly to Mr. Jones.” Schwartz said during his testimony that Free Speech Systems should be allowed to use cash it has on hand to be able to pay vendors, saying otherwise it will have to shut down.  “If we can’t pay the critical vendors then we will be shut down,” Schwartz said. “The company’s in a situation right now where there’s not a whole lot of breathing room.”  US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez said Wednesday he would not permit more withdrawals moving forward and that he found some of Schwartz’s testimony “troubling.”  Court documents filed Friday as part of Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy showed the company has between $10 million and $50 million in estimated assets and between $50 million and $100 million in estimated liabilities. An attorney for Free Speech Systems said at the hearing Wednesday that the company has about $1.3 million cash on hand.  Schwartz stressed the importance of being able to pay vendors that allow the company to broadcast and sell products online, saying that when Jones is not on the air discussing products he sells, the company sees a 30% drop in sales. “If we can’t broadcast, we can’t sell,” Schwartz said.  Schwartz testified the management structure of Free Speech Systems was not set up the way a successful business should be managed.  “There is Alex and then there is everybody else,” Schwartz testified.  Schwartz said accounting controls were, as far as he could tell after taking control of the company, “nonexistent,” that the people responsible for maintaining the company’s books did not have accounting degrees and that there had been no financial reports produced in at least 18 months when he took over.  Lawyers homed in on Jones’ salary under the bankruptcy plan, saying documents showed Jones’ salary before the bankruptcy was $625,000 a year, and under a restructuring plan, it would amount to about $1.3 million. Schwartz said Jones’ salary could be considered reasonable because of his value to the company.  “Who is more valuable? Nobody,” Schwartz said. Lopez authorized a lower salary for Jones to be paid, of about $20,000 every other week.  When asked how much the company had spent on legal expenses related to the Sandy Hook lawsuits, Schwartz said company records show at least $4.5 million have been spent between 2018 and 2021, but that he does not believe that number is accurate.  Schwartz also testified that Jones used a company-associated American Express card to pay for personal expenses, including housekeeping charges, regularly in the past 18 months. The card had $300,000 a month in charges, but Schwartz said accounting staff did not label what the charges were for.  “We can’t tell you whether it’s for electricity, entertainment or electronic supplies for the production studio,” Schwartz said.  Lopez said he would not authorize the current American Express bill of about $172,000 to be paid.   Schwartz said he didn’t know who Jones was before being hired, and that he doesn’t agree with many of Jones’ views but occasionally consults with him on matters involving the business.  Three smaller companies tied to Jones declared bankruptcy earlier this year, briefly pausing the suits against Jones. But the families suing him dropped those companies from their lawsuits so that the cases could move forward against only Jones and Free Speech Systems. Shortly after, the companies exited bankruptcy protection.  – CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed reporting."",",Marc Schwartz;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Christopher Lopez,Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;American Express;American Express;Cnn,"EXTREMISM,66;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1603;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,667;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1759;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2314;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2471;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2314;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2471;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2314;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2471;TRIAL,185;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,185;INFO_HOAX,597;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3972;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4376;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,740;ECON_BITCOIN,1109;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,13;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2617;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,4599;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,116;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,324;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1436;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1951;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2125;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2564;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,4856;FREESPEECH,116;FREESPEECH,324;FREESPEECH,1436;FREESPEECH,1951;FREESPEECH,2125;FREESPEECH,2564;FREESPEECH,4856;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2109;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3348;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3450;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,244;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,549;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,244;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,549;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,244;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,549;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,3010;TAX_FNCACT_ACCOUNTANT,28;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,762;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,762;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1812;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,1812;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,1812;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,1812;",American;Sandy Hook;Texas
106,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/biden-second-term-joe-manchin-cnntv/,"""articleBody"":""Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia refused to say Sunday whether he thinks President Joe Biden deserves a second term in office.  “I’m not getting involved in any election right now. 2022, 2024, I’m not speculating on it. President Biden is my president right now. I’m going to work with him and his administration to the best of my ability to help the people in my state of West Virginia and this country,” Manchin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” when asked whether he thinks Biden deserves to be reelected in two years.  Biden lost Manchin’s home state of West Virginia by 39 points in 2020.   Asked by NBC on Sunday if he hopes Democrats keep control of the US House and the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections, Manchin again appeared reticent, saying: “You know, I’m not making those choices or decisions on that.”  “I’m going to work with whatever I have. I’ve always said that. I think the Democrats have great candidates that are running. They’re good people I’ve worked with. And I have a tremendous amount of respect and friendship with my Republican colleagues,” he said. “So I can work on either side very easily.” The comments from Manchin, a moderate Democrat whose reluctance to support some of Biden’s domestic agenda has at times prevented the President from achieving some legislative goals, further underscore his unpredictable nature as a swing vote within the party. They also come as more and more Democrats say they want someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee in 2024.  A CNN poll released last week found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than the President in the 2024 election, a sharp increase from earlier this year. The results accompany low approval ratings for Biden amid widespread discontent with the state of the country and the economy.  An earlier CNN Poll, conducted in January and February, showed 51% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters saying they wanted someone other than Biden to be the Democratic nominee in the next presidential election. The White House said last year that Biden intends to run for reelection in 2024, following a report indicating that the commander in chief and his staff are attempting to assuage concerns about his future political prospects. Last week, Manchin handed the President a potential legislative victory after he and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal on a major energy and health care bill that represented a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again. Manchin told Tapper on Sunday that Biden deserved credit for the agreement.  “You don’t do a bill this magnitude and this size without the President knowing what’s going on, the President being involved in, to a certain extent, but also giving approval. And that’s what President Biden did,” he said. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.

270,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/election-deniers-tuesday-primaries-arizona-michigan/,"""articleBody"":""Republican voters in several key swing states could select election deniers as their nominees for governorships and other top offices in primaries Tuesday. The issue is at the heart of high-profile races in Arizona and Michigan – two of the most important presidential battlegrounds – weeks after Republican voters elsewhere selected promoters of former President Donald Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election as nominees for several posts that could position them to manage key states’ election machinery in 2024. Arizona, in particular, has been the epicenter of Trump’s election denialism. Once a Republican stronghold, the state has become one of the nation’s most competitive, with Democrats winning the presidential race and both Senate seats there in recent years. That political shift was met with a sham, partisan review of the 2020 election results ordered last year by the GOP-led state Senate.  Here’s a look at the election deniers on the ballot in key races Tuesday in the Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington state primaries:  Arizona The GOP could be poised to nominate a statewide ticket of Trump-backed election deniers on Tuesday.  In the race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, Trump-endorsed former television journalist Kari Lake has built her campaign around lies about election fraud. She referred to the refusal of her leading rival, Ducey-backed Karrin Taylor Robson, to indulge those lies as “disqualifying.” The race for secretary of state – Arizona’s chief elections officer – also features an election denier endorsed by Trump in Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker who was in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, and wrongly claims that Trump won the 2020 election. Trump-backed Blake Masters, who is seeking to face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, hasn’t just claimed that Democrats “pulled out all the stops” to cheat in 2020, but has suggested the 2022 midterms won’t be fair. Masters faces other Republicans who have rejected the 2020 election outcome, including businessman Jim Lamon, who touts his efforts to fund the bogus review of Maricopa County’s 2020 results. Another candidate, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, sent a letter claiming to have uncovered election fraud, without detailing any fraud in how the election was managed.  Trump’s chosen candidate in the race for attorney general, Abraham Hamadeh, said he would “take the fraud in our 2020 election seriously and bring justice to those who’ve undermined our Republic.”  Michigan Trump on Friday endorsed Tudor Dixon in the wide-open Republican primary to take on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is seeking her second term.  Dixon, a conservative commentator, has falsely claimed that Trump won the 2020 election. She is also backed by Michigan’s GOP establishment, including former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ family, the state Chamber of Commerce and Michigan Right to Life.  That GOP gubernatorial primary features several other election deniers, as well. One candidate, Ryan Kelley, was in Washington on January 6, 2021, and has pleaded not guilty to four misdemeanor charges stemming from allegations of his participation in the riot at the US Capitol. Retired pastor Ralph Rebandt said he is “convinced that we would find the fraud” in the 2020 election with a “full forensic audit.” And chiropractor Garrett Soldano has touted a film that promotes an unproven conspiracy theory about the 2020 election.  In the Grand Rapids-based 3rd Congressional District, Rep. Peter Meijer – one of 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment following the insurrection at the Capitol – faces a Trump-backed challenger in John Gibbs.   Gibbs has fully embraced Trump’s election lies. He wrongly claimed in a debate with Meijer that the results that led to Biden’s win in 2020 were “simply mathematically impossible” and said that there were “anomalies in there, to put it very lightly.”  Democrats have attempted to boost Gibbs – whom they believe would be easier to beat in November’s general election – with ads casting him as a Trump-aligned conservative.  Michigan Republicans are also expected to pick Trump-backed election deniers in the races for secretary of state and attorney general. At a convention in April, the state GOP endorsed Kristina Karamo, an educator and right-wing commentator who claimed to have witnessed irregularities in 2020’s election, for secretary of state, and Matthew DePerno, who was a lawyer on a case challenging the 2020 results, for attorney general. But those races aren’t on Tuesday’s primary ballot; instead, Republicans will make their choices official at a party convention in August.  Missouri Missouri’s Republican primary to replace retiring Sen. Roy Blunt features a field packed with candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.  State Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s campaign has run ads touting his role in a lawsuit seeking to overturn Pennsylvania’s 2020 election results.  Former Gov. Eric Greitens, who is attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct, has promoted conspiracy theories about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose nonprofit gave municipalities millions of dollars in grants to administer the 2020 election. Greitens’ campaign hosted a screening of a film promoting that conspiracy theory. He has also called for Arizona to decertify its 2020 election results, citing a sham, partisan review conducted last year. And he has called for election audits around the nation.  St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey has wrongly claimed that President Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election. Rep. Vicky Hartzler said that “we will never know” who won in 2020.  Hartzler and Rep. Billy Long, another Senate candidate, both voted against certifying Biden’s election victory in January 2021. Washington Two more of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump face primary challengers backed by the former President and have embraced his lies about the 2020 election.  Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler faces a primary challenge from Trump-backed Joe Kent, who claimed “rampant voter fraud” had taken place in 2020 in an ad his campaign ran on Facebook.  Rep. Dan Newhouse faces Loren Culp, the Republican who lost Washington’s 2020 gubernatorial race and then filed a lawsuit against the state’s chief elections officer, alleging widespread fraud. Culp’s attorney then withdrew the lawsuit after Washington’s attorney general said he would ask a judge to impose sanctions over the “factually baseless” allegations.  Kansas Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican who oversaw the state’s 2020 election, has defended the legitimacy of the voting process there. However, he faces a primary challenger, former Johnson County commissioner Mike Brown, who has built his campaign on casting doubt on elections’ integrity and blamed Schwab for local oversight issues.  “The 2020 election still has me questioning the integrity and accuracy of our election process,” Brown says in a campaign video."",",Matthew Deperno;Eric Greitens;Vicky Hartzler;Mark Zuckerberg;Joe

435,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/entertainment/anne-heche-car-crash/,"""articleBody"":""Anne Heche remains hospitalized and in intensive care after a car she was driving crashed into a residence in Los Angeles on Friday and became engulfed in flames. “Anne is in the ICU, she’s lucky to be alive. She has severe burns and has a long recovery ahead. Her team and her family are still trying to process what led up to the crash,” a source close to Heche told CNN Saturday morning. The vehicle was traveling at a high speed when it ran off the road and collided with a residence, Los Angeles Police Public Information Officer Jeff Lee told CNN on Friday.  Heche was taken to a hospital by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics in critical condition. It took firefighters more than an hour to “access, confine and fully extinguish the stubborn flames within the heavily damaged structure,” the LAFD said. There were no other injuries reported. A representative for Heche released the following statement:  “Anne is currently in stable condition. Her family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.” On Saturday, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN authorities had yet to question Heche about the circumstances of the incident.  The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the crash and a previous “misdemeanor hit and run” incident, an LAPD spokesperson told CNN Saturday evening.  LAPD said no arrests have been made.  Heche remained in hospital as of Saturday evening and the significant nature of her injuries have prevented officers from interviewing her, the law enforcement source added.  Hours before Heche’s crash on Friday, a new episode of her podcast “Better Together,” was released but it has since been removed from their Apple Podcast landing page. During a portion of the podcast, Heche and her co-host, Heather Duffy, discuss drinking vodka and wine and Heche talks about having a “bad day.” It’s unclear when the podcast was recorded. CNN has reached out to Heche’s representatives for comment. “Today’s been a very unique day,” Heche says in the podcast. “I don’t know what happened, sometimes days just suck and I don’t know if you ever have them, but some days Mama says are … some days are those no good very bad days.  And I don’t know why some days just end up like this, and things don’t really rock me like that.” Heche first rose to fame on the soap opera “Another World,” where she played the dual role of twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love from 1987 to 1991 and earned a Daytime Emmy Award. She followed that with films like “Donnie Brasco,” “Six Days Seven Nights,” and “Wag the Dog.” Her romantic relationship with Ellen DeGeneres in the late ’90s resulted in intense media attention, much to Heche’s professional frustration. In a 2021 interview with Page Six, Heche said she felt “blacklisted” after going public with their relationship. “I didn’t do a studio picture for 10 years,” said Heche, who dated DeGeneres from 1997 to 2000.  Heche has appeared in numerous television series more recently, including “The Brave,” “Quantico” and “Chicago P.D.” She has several acting projects currently in post-production, according to her IMDB profile.

102,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/michigan-cyclists-killed-suv/,"""articleBody"":""Two cyclists were killed and three were injured Saturday morning when an SUV crossed over the center line while trying to pass another vehicle, Michigan authorities said.  The five cyclists were all participating in the Make-A-Wish bicycle tour, a three-day fundraising event and endurance ride that spans most of the state, according to the Ionia County Sheriff’s Office.  The cyclists were traveling southbound when the SUV, which was traveling northbound, crossed the center line, the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post.  Ionia County is roughly 40 miles east of Grand Rapids.  One cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene while another died from injuries at a nearby hospital, the sheriff’s office said. The three surviving cyclists were transported to hospitals with severe injuries, officials added.  The driver of the SUV was arrested on two counts of Operating while Intoxicated Causing Death and taken to the Ionia County Jail, the sheriff’s office added. Authorities did not release the driver’s name pending charges and an arraignment. The names of the cyclists were also not released. An investigation is ongoing, the sheriff’s office added.  The Make-a-Wish Foundation expressed its condolences towards the cyclists and their loved ones in a statement shared with CNN. “Our staff and the entire Make-A-Wish family are heartbroken and offer our deepest sympathy for the riders involved, their loved ones, and all members of the WAM community during this difficult time,” the organization said. “We are thankful to the first responders who arrived immediately to save lives. We are supporting our riders, staff, and volunteers with grief counseling and assisting with the law enforcement investigation.”"",",,Facebook;Cnn,"MEDIA_SOCIAL,522;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,983;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITALS,789;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1158;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1158;WB_840_JUSTICE,1158;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1158;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1158;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1158;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1158;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,136;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,854;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1050;GENERAL_HEALTH,707;MEDICAL,707;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,707;KILL,27;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,27;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,361;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,496;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,721;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,997;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,1183;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,361;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,496;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,721;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,997;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1183;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,159;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1023;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,159;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1023;WB_1428_INJURY,686;WB_1428_INJURY,810;WB_1406_DISEASES,686;WB_1406_DISEASES,810;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,686;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,810;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,686;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,810;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,822;WB_135_TRANSPORT,776;ARREST,878;SOC_GENERALCRIME,878;WOUND,44;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,44;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,44;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,44;",Grand Rapids;Ionia County;Michigan
