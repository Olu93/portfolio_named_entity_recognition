664,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/media/axios-cox-enterprises/,"Axios, the buzzy digital media venture founded in in 2017, will sell itself to Cox Enterprises, the two companies announced on Monday. The deal, which is expected to close this month, values Axios at $525 million, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Axios is known for delivering news in brief stories that are comprised of bite-sized pieces of information. The publication is also known for its popular newsletters that often drive the national conversation, especially in Washington, DC. News of the deal was first reported by The New York Times. Cox Enterprises, which was already a top investor in Axios, said that Axios co-founders Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz will continue to lead the outlet’s day-to-day editorial and business decisions. VandeHei, Allen, and Schwartz will also continue to hold “substantial stakes in the company,” Cox Enterprises said. While the three co-founders will remain on the board, Cox Enterprises will control it with four board seats. “We have found our kindred spirit for creating a great, trusted, consequential media company that can outlast us all,” VandeHei said. “Our shared ambitions should be clear: to spread clinical, nonpartisan, trusted journalism to as many cities and as many topics as fast as possible.” Cox Enterprises chief executive Alex Taylor praised Axios as a “forward-thinking organization.” Taylor said Cox Enterprises looks forward “to helping them continue to scale and grow.” “With so much happening in the world, Axios plays a critical role in delivering balanced, trusted news that people need,” Taylor said. “Our company started in the media business, and we have always had a passion for journalism. Cox Enterprises said that its other media companies, such as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Dayton Daily News, will not be impacted by the deal. Axios HQ, the company’s software arm, will not be sold to Cox Enterprises as part of the transaction. It will instead be spun off into a separate company led by VandeHei as chairman and Schwartz as chief executive. “We are excited about entering into this new chapter with Cox and the opportunities we can explore with Axios HQ as a separate business,” Schwartz said. “For both companies, our mission is to help as many people and companies get smarter, faster on what matters.”",Roy Schwartz;Jim Vandehei;Alex Taylor;Mike Allen,Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;New York Times;Dayton Daily News;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cox Enterprises;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,1346;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,2085;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1562;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,2065;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1356;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,2095;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,795;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1679;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2231;MEDIA_MSM,1670;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,53;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1125;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1670;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1772;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,53;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1125;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1670;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1772;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,53;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1125;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1670;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1772;TAX_FNCACT_INVESTOR,651;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE,1356;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE,2095;",Washington;New York
257,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/energy/joe-biden-saudi-trip-opec-analysis/,"Candidate Joe Biden promised in 2019 to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over the kingdom’s human rights record. President Biden, confronted by economic reality, reversed himself. With gasoline prices near record highs and inflation fears mounting, Biden visited OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia last month. Biden even fist-bumped Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who US intelligence directly linked to the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The President left Saudi Arabia without a public agreement from the kingdom to help out on gas prices, but White House officials expressed optimism that help was indeed on the way.  Now, it’s clear that Biden’s political gamble to make nice with MBS has not paid off in a significant way that Americans will feel at the gas pump, at least not yet.  OPEC+ announced Wednesday a deal to increase oil production, but only by a token amount of 100,000 barrels per day. That is not nearly enough to move the needle in a world that consumes 100 million barrels of oil every single day. “That is miniscule, almost imperceptible,” Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN.  For context, OPEC+ announced a larger increase of 648,000 barrels per day in late June.  This latest move amounts to the smallest increase in production on a percentage basis in OPEC history, according to analysis by McNally.  “OPEC+ did the absolute minimum. The market is interpreting this as just short of a rebuff,” he said. “It’s a purely symbolic gesture.” Others go even further, describing the OPEC+ move as an insult given Biden’s journey to Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the producer group. “It’s a slap in the face for the Biden administration. This trip, meeting with MBS, just didn’t work,” Matt Smith, lead oil analyst Americas at Kpler, told CNN. Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, similarly described the OPEC+ decision as a “slap in the face.” “I must say I am surprised they only threw in 100,000 barrels per day,” Yawger said. ‘Step in the right direction,’ White House says  Oil prices initially rallied on the OPEC+ news, relieved the producer group didn’t act more aggressively. However, oil later reversed course after new government statistics showed an unexpected jump in inventories, renewing concerns about weakening demand.  Even the White House conceded the OPEC+ decision will not significantly affect the price of gasoline for Americans. “Well, no it doesn’t,” White House senior energy adviser for energy security Amos Hochstein said when asked by CNN’s Jim Sciutto whether the move will have a major effect.  By contrast, on July 19 Hochstein told CNN he was “pretty confident” that OPEC+ would move to raise production “as a result of the president’s conversations.” Hochstein described Wednesday’s move as a “step in the right direction,” but declined to say if Biden was disappointed the increase wasn’t bigger.  Recession jitters  Of course, there may be legitimate reasons why OPEC+ decided not to heed Biden’s call to ramp up production. Recession fears have swirled in recent weeks, raising concern in the oil market about weakening demand for energy. US oil prices closed on Monday at their weakest point in five months, taking pressure off OPEC+ to step up with a big production increase.  After racing above $5 a gallon in June for the first time, gasoline prices have also cooled off considerably. The national average for regular gasoline dropped to $4.16 a gallon on Wednesday, marking 50 consecutive days of falling prices, according to AAA. There is also growing doubt in the oil market about how much firepower OPEC+ truly has to increase production, even if it wanted to.  The producer group has consistently undershot its own production targets, raising question about how much spare capacity remains outside of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  OPEC+ hinted at this issue in its statement on Wednesday, saying the “severely limited availability of excess capacity necessitates utilizing it with great caution in response to severe supply disruptions.” “I suspect they don’t have the barrels to increase,” said Mizuho’s Yawger.  No matter the reason behind OPEC+’s miniscule production hike, it’s hard to imagine Biden got what he wanted when he reluctantly agreed to sit down with MBS.",Matt Smith;Mizuho Yawger;Jamal Khashoggi;Jim Sciutto;Robert Yawger;Amos Hochstein;Joe Biden;Bob Mcnally,Rapidan Energy Group;White House;White House;White House;White House;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2297;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2297;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,14;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,695;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,88;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,1893;ECON_INFLATION,225;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,225;WB_442_INFLATION,225;ENV_OIL,874;ENV_OIL,1046;ENV_OIL,1822;ENV_OIL,2138;ENV_OIL,2254;ENV_OIL,3179;ENV_OIL,3228;ENV_OIL,3652;AFFECT,2474;SOC_GENERALCRIME,407;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2589;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,777;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2510;EPU_ECONOMY,144;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,144;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,195;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,3428;ECON_HEATINGOIL,195;ECON_HEATINGOIL,3428;FUELPRICES,579;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,335;MEDIA_MSM,452;TAX_FNCACT_JOURNALIST,452;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,2569;TAX_ECON_PRICE,195;TAX_ECON_PRICE,579;TAX_ECON_PRICE,2145;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3235;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3428;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3591;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,1830;TAX_FNCACT_PRODUCER,1690;TAX_FNCACT_PRODUCER,2205;TAX_FNCACT_PRODUCER,3762;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,1674;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,95;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,95;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,95;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,95;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,3168;ECON_OILPRICE,2145;ECON_OILPRICE,3235;LEADER,113;LEADER,491;LEADER,1133;LEADER,1893;LEADER,2816;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,113;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,491;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1133;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1893;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2816;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,113;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,491;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1133;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1893;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2816;TAX_FNCACT_CROWN_PRINCE,335;TAX_ETHNICITY_ARAB,3921;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,595;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,2127;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,2416;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,2547;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,605;",White House;The White House;Americans;Washington;United Arab Emirates;Saudi Arabia
338,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/media/alex-jones-sandy-hook-trial/,"The parents of a child who was murdered during the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting delivered emotional testimony in a Texas court on Tuesday, telling a jury that the lies pushed by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones have stained the legacy of their son and tormented them for years. The jury hearing the case will determine how much in damages Jones will have to pay the parents, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, who won a default judgement against him earlier this year. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis asked the jury last week to award Heslin and Lewis $150 million.  Fighting back tears at times, Heslin told the jury that Jones, through his conspiratorial media organization Infowars, “tarnished the honor and legacy” of his son. Heslin said that he couldn’t “even begin to describe the last nine-and-a-half years of hell” he has endured because of Jones. “There’s got to be a strong deterrent that shall prevent him from peddling this propaganda,” Heslin said, adding that through his testimony he wanted “to restore my credibility, my reputation, and Jesse’s legacy that he so much deserves.” As Heslin testified, a television screen in the court showed a photograph of his murdered son, six-year-old Jesse Lewis. Jones, who is expected to testify in his own defense later on Tuesday, was absent from the courtroom during Heslin’s testimony and the first part of Lewis’ testimony. Heslin called that absence “a cowardly act.” “I’ve been here for a week and a half and [during] my final testimony Mr. Alex Jones does not have the courage to sit in front of me or face me,” Heslin said. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis told CNN the two have needed to be in isolation and under the protection of professional security during the trial. Heslin also said on the stand that the lie pushed by Jones “resonates around the world” and that he has realized “how dangerous” it is. Heslin described being repeatedly confronted by those who believed Jones over the last ten years, saying such interactions occur “right up to this day.” “My life has been threatened,” Heslin said. “I fear for my life. I fear for my safety and my family’ safety and their life.” ‘Jesse was real. I’m a real mom’ In a remarkable moment in court, Lewis directly spoke to Jones, who was in the courtroom after the trial broke for lunch. She said that she wanted to address Jones to his face. “Jesse was real,” Lewis told Jones. “I’m a real mom.” Lewis told Jones that she thinks he didn’t actually believe the lies he pushed about Sandy Hook. “That’s the problem, I know you know that,” Lewis told Jones. “But you keep saying it. Why? Why? For money?” Lewis said that “having a six-year-old son shot in the forehead” while at school is an “unbearable pain.” “And then to have someone on top of that perpetuate a lie that it was a hoax, that it didn’t happen, that it was a false flag, and that I was an actress — You think I’m an actress?” Lewis asked. Lewis told the jury that monetary damages were appropriate in the case because she doesn’t believe Jones will ever stop. “There has not been a sincere apology,” she said. “But if there was, ever, I liken it to being in a car accident and you run over someone and cause tremendous bodily damage and you look at that person lying on the ground and say, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m not accountable for any of the damage I just caused. But I’m sorry.’ That’s how I see it.” Regardless, Lewis said that she does not believe Jones understands the repercussions “of going on air with a huge audience and lying and calling this a hoax.” “It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this,” Lewis told Jones. “That we have to implore you — not just implore you, punish you — to get you to stop lying…It is surreal what is going on in here.” Lewis also testified in court that she has been harassed and received death threats, including at her own home, all of which she said reopens the wounds surrounding her son’s murder. “The fear and anxiety and unsafeness … keeps me from healing,” Lewis said. “It definitely negatively impacts the healing process.” Lewis described the conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook as “deeply unsettling.” “I feel compromised,” Lewis said, describing how she feels about her own personal safety. Roy Lubit, a forensic psychiatrist who was hired to conduct an examination of Heslin and Lewis, testified to the court on Monday how terrified and worried for their personal safety the two parents are.  Lubit told the court that Lewis and Heslin “are very, very frightened.” When asked to specify who they are frightened of, Lubit responded, “Some follower of Jones trying to kill them.” Lubit elaborated that Lewis sleeps with a gun, a knife, and pepper spray on her night stand. Lubit added she won’t even turn on the air conditioning during hot days for fear of not being able to hear an intruder possibly coming to hurt her.  Lewis testified Tuesday that she owns a gun to keep her other son safe, telling the jury that she failed to keep one son safe and will do everything in her power to ensure that no harm happens to her other child. ‘This is not your show’ Jones took the stand in the afternoon, telling the court he felt “good” because he was being afforded the opportunity to push back against the plaintiffs and news media. From the stand, Jones told Heslin and Lewis, “I never intentionally tried to hurt you.” Jones said “the internet had a lot of questions” about the Sandy Hook shooting, and so did he. Jones argued he simply had “tried to find out what actually happened.” After the jury had left the courtroom following Jones’ testimony, Mark Bankston, the attorney for the plaintiffs, accused Jones and his attorney, Federico Andino Reynal, of trying to “poison” the trial. Bankston said that they would file a motion for sanctions against both Jones and Reynal. Bankston specifically said Jones broke court orders when he attempted to discuss his net worth from the stand. “Mr. Jones just intentionally did that in violation of your order to attempt to poison this compensatory damage verdict to try to tell this jury that he’s broke, and he’s not, and that’s in violation of your order,” Bankston said to the judge. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said she will hear any motions officially filed for sanctions against Jones and Reynal after the conclusion of the trial. But Gamble admonished Jones for his behavior and said he had already violated his oath to tell the truth twice. “Mr. Jones, you may not say to this jury that you complied with discovery. That is not true. You may not say it again. You may not tell this jury that you are bankrupt. That is also not true,” Gamble said. “You are already under oath to tell the truth,” Gamble added. “You’ve already violated that oath twice today, in just those two examples. It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify. Yet here I am again.” “This is not your show,” Gamble added. Jones attempted to tell Gamble that he believed he was telling the truth. “You believe everything you say is true, but your beliefs do not make something true,” Gamble said. “That is that is what we’re doing here. Just because you claim to think something is true does not make it true. It does not protect you. It is not allowed. You’re under oath. That means things must actually be true when you say them.” At the conclusion of court proceedings, Lewis walked over to Jones and handed him a bottle of water because he had complained about having trouble speaking due to a torn larynx. Jones started talking to Lewis and Heslin and the exchange with Heslin grew heated. An attorney for Heslin and Lewis interjected, telling Jones as he escorted his clients out of the courtroom, “That’s not even a thought. That’s not the way this goes.” Jones shouted back, “Why because you can’t feed them fake videos anymore?” Other legal developments Jones has lashed out at the judicial proceedings taking place, baselessly claiming last week that he was being tried in Texas before a “kangaroo court.” Infowars has also published content attacking the judges overseeing the cases in vicious terms. Jones’ media company, Free Speech Systems, which is the company that operates Infowars, filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday. Jury selection for a similar trial involving Jones and Sandy Hook families commenced on Tuesday in Connecticut, where Jones was also found liable for damages earlier this year. But jury selection was suspended after Jones’ attorneys filed documents in federal court to remove the case for now due to Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy filing. Attorneys representing some Sandy Hook families have accused Jones of having drained Free Speech Systems of assets in recent years as part of an effort to protect himself from potential judgements he may be ordered to pay. One of the attorneys, Avi Moshenberg, told CNN on Tuesday that the bankruptcy filing made by Free Speech Systems indicated that $62 million in assets had been withdrawn from the company in 2021 and 2022. “If you look at the bankruptcy filing, leading up to the declaration of bankruptcy, Alex Jones, the sole owner [of Free Speech Systems], took $62 million in draws in 2021 and 2022,” Moshenberg told CNN. “Just straight up draws. That’s why the company has few assets.” A lawyer representing Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday morning. But a hearing is scheduled on Wednesday in which W.

211,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/business/fancy-feast-cat-food-restaurant-trnd/,"Cat food brand Fancy Feast is expanding into feline-inspired human cuisine, with a New York City Italian restaurant designed to celebrate the company’s new line. Gatto Bianco, which means “white cat,” is described by Fancy Feast as an “Italian-style trattoria,” and will be open for dinner reservations on August 11-12 only, according to a news release from Purina, which produces Fancy Feast. The human-friendly dishes were inspired by Fancy Feast’s new “Medleys” cat food line, which feature options like “Beef Ragú Recipe With Tomatoes & Pasta in a Savory Sauce” for the cat with discerning taste.  Only a lucky few will have the opportunity to try the Gatto Bianco pop-up, located between Manhattan’s Far West Village and the Meatpacking District. The experience is limited to a total of 16 guests, who will each enjoy a complimentary tasting menu free of charge. The menu was designed by Fancy Feast’s in-house chef, Amanda Hassner, and New York restaurateur Cesare Casella, Purina noted. “Food has the power to connect us to others in meaningful ways and take us to places we have never been,” said Hassner in Purina’s release. “The same is true for our cats. The dishes at Gatto Bianco are prepared in ways that help cat owners understand how their cats experience food – from flavor, to texture, to form – in a way that only Fancy Feast can.” This isn’t Fancy Feast’s first foray into human dining. In 2021, the company released a cookbook with recipes cat lovers can make to pair with their cat’s food. For those who can’t get their paws on a reservation, the company will post the recipes on its website.",Cesare Casella;Amanda Hassner;Gatto Bianco;Gatto Bianco;Gatto Bianco,Cnn,,Manhattan;New York;Italian
367,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/economy/consumer-credit-borrowing-surge/,"Americans are piling up credit card debt as they struggle to keep up with the high cost of living. US household debt surpassed $16 trillion for the first time ever during the second quarter, the New York Federal Reserve said Tuesday. Even as borrowing costs surge, the NY Fed said credit card balances increased by $46 billion last quarter. Over the past year, credit card debt has jumped by $100 billion, or 13%, the biggest percentage increase in more than 20 years. Credit cards typically charge high interest rates when balances aren’t fully paid off, making this an expensive form of debt. The NY Fed said the credit card binge at least partly reflects inflation as prices rise at the fastest pace in more than four decades. “The impacts of inflation are apparent in high volumes of borrowing,” NY Fed researchers wrote in a blog post. High inflation is also making it more expensive to carry a credit card balance because the Federal Reserve is aggressively raising borrowing costs. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point last week for the second month in a row.  Not only are credit card balances rising, but Americans opened 233 million new credit card accounts during the second quarter, the most since 2008, the NY Fed report found. High inflation is also forcing consumers to dip into their savings. The personal savings rate fell in June to 5.1%, the lowest since August 2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week. Despite rising debt levels, the NY Fed said consumer balance sheets appear to be in a “strong position” overall. Most of the 2% quarter-over-quarter increase in US household debt to $16.2 trillion was driven by a jump in mortgage borrowing. Student loan balances were little changed at $1.6 trillion. By and large, Americans continued to pay down debt on schedule last quarter, a reflection of the very strong job market. The NY Fed said the share of current debt transitioning into delinquency remains “historically very low,” though it did increase modestly. “Although debt balances are growing rapidly, households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well,” the NY Fed said in the report, noting the unprecedented assistance from the federal government during the onset of Covid-19. There are hints, however, that some lower-income and subprime borrowers are now struggling to keep up with their bills. The report found that the delinquency transition rate for credit cards and auto loans is “creeping up,” especially in lower-income areas. “With the supportive policies of the pandemic mostly in the past, there are pockets of borrowers who are beginning to show some distress on their debt,” the report said. Helped by moratoriums and forbearance programs, foreclosures remain “very low,” according to the report. However, credit reports indicate the number of new foreclosures increased by 11,000 during the second quarter, the NY Fed said, potentially signaling the “beginning of a return to more typical levels.”",,Bureau Of Labor Statistics;Federal Reserve;Federal Reserve,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2452;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2452;EDUCATION,1210;EDUCATION,1302;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1210;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1302;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,237;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,962;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,237;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,962;WB_336_NON_BANK_FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS,1907;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1907;WB_612_HOUSING_FINANCE,1907;WB_332_CAPITAL_MARKETS,1907;ECON_INFLATION,678;ECON_INFLATION,768;ECON_INFLATION,870;ECON_INFLATION,1500;WB_442_INFLATION,678;WB_442_INFLATION,768;WB_442_INFLATION,870;WB_442_INFLATION,1500;USPEC_POLICY1,2770;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,22;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1369;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2005;GENERAL_HEALTH,2338;GENERAL_HEALTH,2786;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2338;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2786;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2338;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2786;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2338;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2786;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2338;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2786;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2338;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2786;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2338;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2786;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2338;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2786;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,1926;SCIENCE,831;ECON_DEBT,53;ECON_DEBT,131;ECON_DEBT,401;ECON_DEBT,602;ECON_DEBT,1698;ECON_DEBT,1854;ECON_DEBT,2032;ECON_DEBT,2145;ECON_DEBT,2257;ECON_DEBT,2892;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,53;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,131;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,401;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,602;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1698;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1854;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2032;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2145;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2257;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2892;WB_450_DEBT,53;WB_450_DEBT,131;WB_450_DEBT,401;WB_450_DEBT,602;WB_450_DEBT,1698;WB_450_DEBT,1854;WB_450_DEBT,2032;WB_450_DEBT,2145;WB_450_DEBT,2257;WB_450_DEBT,2892;ECON_COST_OF_LIVING,110;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,2481;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,527;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,527;UNGP_EDUCATION,1931;MEDIA_SOCIAL,847;TAX_ECON_PRICE,100;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATE,1046;",New York;Americans

256,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/business/equifax-wrong-credit-scores/,"Credit giant Equifax sent lenders incorrect credit scores for millions of consumers this spring, in a technology snafu with major real-world impact. In certain cases the errors were significant enough — the differential was at least 25 points for around 300,000 consumers — that some would-be borrowers may have been wrongfully denied credit, the company said in a statement. Shares fell about 2% Tuesday on the report and were down nearly 5% and shortly after the open Wednesday. The problem occurred because of a “coding issue” when making a change to one of Equifax’s servers, according to the company, which said the issue “was in place over a period of a few weeks [and] resulted in the potential miscalculation” of credit scores. While Equifax did not specify dates or figures, a June 1 alert from housing agency Freddie Mac to its clients said Equifax told the agency that about 12% of all credit scores released from March 17 to April 6 may be have been incorrect. Equifax wrote that “there was no shift in the vast majority of scores” and that “credit reports were not affected.” But the company declined to comment to CNN Business about how people can learn whether they were among those whose credit scores were incorrectly reported — and what recourse they may have if they were issued loans at a higher rate or denied a loan outright because of the snafu. Equifax issued its statement later Tuesday, hours after the Wall Street Journal published a report about the errors. Trade publication National Mortgage Professional had reported in May that Equifax was warning lenders about the possibility of incorrect scores, and the company released a statement to the magazine at the time acknowledging the technology-based error. Tuesday’s disclosure about the score errors comes just after Equifax said its board voted to give CEO Mark Begor a $25 million retention bonus package.  Last Friday’s regulatory filing announcing the bonus said the board believes Boger is “uniquely qualified to continue to lead the Company during the final stages of our $1.5 billion technology transformation.”  Equifax tracks the credit history of millions of borrowers — almost all Americans — and sells that information to banks and other lenders. As one of only three major credit reporting companies, Equifax plays an outsized role in the credit-score business: Its information helps lenders set interests for borrowers or deny borrowers seeking mortgages, car loans or credit cards.  This isn’t the first data issue for Equifax. In 2017, the company revealed that the personal information of nearly 150 million people was compromised. The company eventually reached a deal to pay up to $700 million to state and federal regulators to settle probes related to the incident, the largest settlement ever paid for a data breach.

314,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/asia/extreme-heat-migrant-workers-climate-intl-hnk-dst/,"It was mid-afternoon on a sweltering Saturday when Raj, a laborer from northwest India, started feeling dizzy as he hauled heavy bags of concrete mix and sand on a construction site in downtown Singapore.  Temperatures had reached 34 degrees Celsius (94 degrees Fahrenheit), but Raj carried on despite the heat and soon developed a splitting headache. Within minutes, he collapsed to his knees and vomited.  “I felt very weak,” Raj said. “My head was spinning and my legs (gave way).”   The 32-year-old father of two is among millions of migrant laborers in Asia working on construction sites, shipyards, mines, factories, farms and plantations, who experts say are left vulnerable due to their prolonged outdoor exposure to high heat and humidity. “The heat scares me,” said Raj, who is being identified by only his first name because he fears repercussions from his company as well as the Singapore authorities for speaking about his working conditions.  “I have no choice. I have to work to support my family.”  For years, scientists warned that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. Now, many parts of the world are experiencing dangerous levels of heat – with little relief in sight.  Countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France and China recently issued extreme heat alerts and scientists predict even higher temperatures to come. “It’s been troubling to see events unfold the way science has predicted,” said Radhika Khosla, an associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment. “We are seeing fewer trees and more built up concrete areas that result in higher rates of heat stress, especially in vulnerable communities. “We’ve clearly not listened and adapted.”  Few places to escape the heat During recent heat waves, governments and global bodies like the United Nations advised people to remain indoors and switch on air conditioning to prevent heat-related illnesses. But that advice is all but impossible for migrant laborers and other workers who lack access to cooling technology. “Migrant workers are too often excluded and forgotten from most global conversations about the climate crisis even though they are clearly one of the most vulnerable groups at risk,” said British researcher and migrant worker rights specialist Andy Hall.  Hall highlighted concerns shared by many migrant workers on construction sites in countries like Singapore and Malaysia, who said that they were still being made to work outdoors despite extreme heat. They said they were not permitted to enter most air-conditioned public spaces like shopping malls and other buildings because of rules by landlords and tenants prohibiting their entry and to avoid complaints being made by members of the public, Hall said. Instead, they escape the heat by resting in parks or under trees, bridges and highways, he added. “They are unable to benefit from these (cool air solutions) due to systemic restrictions as well as discrimination. It’s disappointing,” Hall said. “Their welfare in the ongoing heat crisis needs to be a bigger topic of discussion.”  Prolonged heat exposure is also a problem in other Asian countries like India, which saw crop yields significantly reduced in May due to heat stress faced by farmers and workers, and Thailand – where activists say sugarcane cutters reported severe heat exhaustion in April from working long periods in the fields. Ahnaf, a laborer from Bangladesh, said he endures grueling 12-hour work days on an oil palm plantation in southern Malaysia, followed by hot, sleepless nights in an overcrowded and poorly ventilated dormitory room he shares with seven other men.  Like Raj, he is using only one name because he fears potential repercussions from his employer and the Malaysian government for complaining about his working conditions. “Working all day is tiring but it’s also hard to sleep and rest at night when it is so crowded and hot,” he said.  Jason Lee Kai Wei from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS) said that the lack of access to convenient cooling systems like air conditioning was “a matter of life and death” for many migrant workers. “If their working and living conditions do not improve, they could end up paying a high price with their lives,” he said.   Lee, also director at the NUS Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, said there were “solutions at hand,” on the part of companies that employ migrant laborers, like enforcing proper breaks during the hottest time of the day to protect workers’ health and safety. “But at the end of the day, employers must be convinced that the health and productivity (of migrant workers) can be achieved in tandem – not one or the other,” he said. “The problem is many of these work sites do not offer these solutions to workers.”   Leading Singaporean migrant worker rights activist Jolovan Wham said that the government had not imposed “stop work orders”  for migrant workers during the recent hot spell. “So companies can still insist that their workers continue even when temperatures are higher than normal,” Wham said.   Heat has always been an issue for migrant laborers, as well as domestic workers, in the city-state, he added. “They will not speak up about the terrible living and working conditions due to the heat because they are afraid,” he said.  “They carry on because at the end of the day, their jobs are too important and they can’t afford to lose work.”  Li, the owner of a construction company in Singapore, told CNN that many of his migrant workers were “severely affected” by the heat. He said they were given appropriate rest breaks but were still bound by other official protocols such as wearing heavy safety gear like helmets and thick rubber boots that trap huge amounts of heat. “It all adds up,” said Li, who didn’t want his full name published for fear of government repercussions. “The heat isn’t dying down or going away and that affects overall productivity – but we still have building projects to complete,” he said.   In an official report addressing work place heat stress, Singapore’s Manpower Ministry recommended measures including acclimatising workers to the local weather by adjusting workloads and monitoring workers for early signs of heat stress. “Working in Singapore’s hot and humid weather puts workers at an increased risk of heat injuries,” the ministry said in the report. “Employers have a duty to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, necessary measures to ensure that the work environment is safe and without risk to their employees’ safety and health.”  A spokesperson for the ministry told CNN that companies employing migrant workers are required to make provisions during periods of excessive heat and would be “subjected to enforcement actions under the Workplace Safety and Health Act if they failed to comply.”   Cooling gap between rich and poor As the climate crisis causes global temperatures to increase, the gap between rich and poorer nations is set to widen, according to a 2021 study by the Climate Impact Lab global research initiative.  “Richer populations can protect themselves from the impacts of warming but the global poor don’t have this luxury,” said Solomon Hsiang, a co-author of the paper. He added that access to air conditioning and electric fans would still remain “out of reach for more than half of the global population” in the coming decades.  In a strongly worded recent report that addressed extreme heat, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on governments to act to protect vulnerable people from “current and foreseeable harms of extreme heat.” “Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard (and) certain people are exposed to far more heat than others such as those often doing low-paying work outdoors or in hot kitchens and warehouses,” said HRW senior environment researcher Katharina Rall.  Scientists say increasing access to cooling technology for vulnerable people should be “immediate priorities” for governments around the world. “Air conditioned public spaces are go-to places during extreme heat,” said Winston Chow, an associate professor at the College of Integrative Studies at Singapore Management University. “Restricting access to cool spaces for vulnerable people like the elderly, disabled and migrant workers who spend a disproportionate amount of time outdoors working, would be the worst thing to do when heat waves are happening.”  Oxford professor Khosla pointed to the tremendous amounts of energy consumed by standard air conditioners and said that cooling technology needs to shift towards long-term sustainability. “Air conditioning is necessary given the rising levels of heat but it has to be much more energy efficient,” she said. She added that replacing air conditioning units with more eco-friendly models would be financially costly but consuming less electricity and reducing carbon footprints would go a long way in helping the environment.  “High energy efficiency models without damaging refrigerant gases that run on fossil fuel-free electricity sources are our best options,” she said. After suffering signs of heat stress, Raj said he was taken to a hospital in Singapore near the construction site where he worked.  He waited for about an hour in an air-conditioned room before being examined by a doctor and given a clean bill of health. “It was very nice and cold and I felt better,” he said. “The last time I had air conditioning was when I was on the plane to Singapore.”  “I work outdoors every day and there is no air conditioning in the dormitory. We have ceiling fans but they are (adjusted) to low speed so my friends and I rotate our sleeping arrangements so we can sleep under the fans,” he said.  “It’s not much, but at least it’s something.”",Jason Lee Kai Wei;Winston Chow;Katharina Rall;Radhika Khosla;Heather Chen;Andy Hall,Yong Loo Lin School Of Medicine;Performance Centre;United Nations;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Oxford University

165,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/justice-department-employees-abortion-access/,"A group of Justice Department employees sent a list of demands to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, asking for the administration to expand health care coverage to include abortion-related benefits like paid leave to travel out of state and reimbursement for travel expenses.   The group, the Department of Justice Gender Equality Network, told administration officials they have not done enough to support federal workers since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June.  “[T]he federal government has chosen not to follow countless employers in the private sector that support their employees affected by restrictive state laws,” states the letter from DOJ GEN, a 1,200-member organization comprised of Justice Department employees who pursue gender equity in the federal workforce. “Failing to act quickly to address this issue could hinder the Administration’s work to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the federal workforce, and harm the Administration’s efforts to recruit and retain talented employees.” In the weeks since Roe was overturned, several large companies, including Amazon, Bank of America and Target, have promised to cover certain expenses for employees who need to travel for abortion services. The employees are asking the administration to approve paid leave and coverage of travel expenses for federal employees who travel out of state for abortion care; allow federal workers to decline work travel to states that ban abortion; pledge to shield employees who are prosecuted for abortion-related crimes from being penalized in the federal workforce; promise to fight the Hyde Amendment; and to add federal employees to newly formed reproductive rights task forces.   “These are meaningful steps the administration should take right now to protect abortion access for the nation’s 2 million federal public servants and their dependents in states that have already banned abortion, or likely will soon,” said Stacey Young, President of the Gender Equality Network. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department and the White House for comment. President Joe Biden and Garland have both repeatedly pledged to protect abortion rights. On Wednesday, the President issued his second executive order designed to ensure access to abortion care this summer. Wednesday’s order would pave the way for Medicaid to pay for certain abortion services for people forced to travel outside their state, though questions loom whether this would violate the Hyde Amendment which prohibits the use of federal funds to perform abortions. The Justice Department on Tuesday filed its first lawsuit related to abortion rights against the state of Idaho, asking a federal court to block the state’s abortion ban set to go into effect August 25. DOJ GEN sent a similar letter to administration officials in May after the leak of a draft opinion that signaled the Supreme Court was set to overturn Roe. Then, however, the group only asked the administration to allow time off for employees who needed to travel to get an abortion. This latest letter, more than a month after the court issued the decision, asks for much greater protections and benefits for federal workers.  Justice Department employees are asking the administration not only to provide paid leave – arguing that a recent Office of Personnel Management fact sheet reminding workers they can use sick leave for travel does not go far enough – but also to pay for the expenses associated with travel to get an abortion. The group argues that “covering travel expenses would not run afoul of the Hyde Amendment, which restricts only the use of federal funding for most abortion procedures themselves – not ancillary benefits.” Additionally, the group wants the administration to allow federal employees to opt out of work travel to states that ban abortion or relocate entirely if they are based in such a state. Biden and Garland this week have referenced the uncertainty, and often danger, women and doctors have confronted in the wake of Roe being overturned. “Emergency medical care being denied to women experiencing miscarriages, doctors uncertain about what they can do to provide for their patients, pharmacists unsure whether they can fill prescriptions that they’ve always filled before, a tragic case of rape survivors, including a 10-year-old girl forced to travel to another state for care,” Biden said before signing his second executive order on the issue Wednesday.",Stacey Young;Joe Biden,White House;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Biden Justice Department;Biden Justice Department;Department Of Justice Gender Equality Network;Equality Network;Equality Network;Office Of Personnel Management;Justice Department On,"BAN,1706;BAN,2995;BAN,4267;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,737;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,737;MOVEMENT_WOMENS,377;MOVEMENT_WOMENS,2247;WB_919_GENDER_AND_HUMAN_DEVELOPMENT,377;WB_919_GENDER_AND_HUMAN_DEVELOPMENT,2247;UNGP_GENDER_EQUALITY,377;UNGP_GENDER_EQUALITY,2247;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,23;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,361;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,954;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2293;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2838;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3459;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3553;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3643;WB_840_JUSTICE,23;WB_840_JUSTICE,361;WB_840_JUSTICE,954;WB_840_JUSTICE,2293;WB_840_JUSTICE,2838;WB_840_JUSTICE,3459;WB_840_JUSTICE,3553;WB_840_JUSTICE,3643;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,559;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,649;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,2496;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,4866;WB_1648_SICK_LEAVE,3831;WB_752_CONTRIBUTORY_BENEFITS,3831;WB_751_SOCIAL_INSURANCE,3831;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,3831;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,120;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYERS,782;WB_2690_CATEGORIES_OF_EMPLOYMENT,782;WB_2670_JOBS,782;WB_2689_JOBS_DIAGNOSTICS,782;WB_2704_EMPLOYER,782;TAX_FNCACT_PHARMACISTS,4639;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLIC_SERVANTS,2108;WB_615_GENDER,368;WB_615_GENDER,993;WB_615_GENDER,2238;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,4491;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,4749;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,44;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,833;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,975;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1268;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1436;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1494;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1598;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1744;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1903;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,3267;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,3664;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,4222;GENERAL_HEALTH,195;GENERAL_HEALTH,599;GENERAL_HEALTH,689;MEDICAL,195;MEDICAL,599;MEDICAL,689;AFFECT,842;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,592;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,682;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,4416;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,4526;WB_1291_PUBLIC_HEALTH_INSURANCE,2606;WB_625_HEALTH_ECONOMICS_AND_FINANCE,2606;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2606;WB_1287_HEALTH_INSURANCE,2606;EPU_CATS_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAMS,2606;TAX_FNCACT_SERVANTS,2108;TRIAL,79;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,79;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTORS,4426;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTORS,4562;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,4426;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,4562;RECRUITMENT,1240;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,200;LEADER,120;LEADER,2224;LEADER,2362;LEADER,2468;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,120;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2224;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2362;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2468;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,120;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2224;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2362;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2468;USPEC_POLICY1,4391;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,4391;LEGISLATION,868;RAPE,4739;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,4739;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,470;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1664;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3442;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3807;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,2322;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,417;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3080;",Idaho;America;White House

Since he was 10 years old, he would carefully iron his clothes, right down to his socks and underwear. He would later do the same for his kids, making sure they were coordinated from head to toe.   He would likely have done the same for his youngest child. But on February 16, 2020, just two days after she was born, two people entered his apartment, shot him multiple times and left him to die, authorities in Wichita, Kansas, say. Investigators and loved ones believe Winston knew the people who shot him, but the killers have never been identified. For more than two years, his family has been waiting in profound pain and frustration to find out who killed him and why.  “It’s like a hole that hasn’t been filled,” Winston’s mother, Sherby Miller, told CNN. “It’s just a piece of me that’s missing because I don’t know what happened to my child.”   Winston’s death is one of Kansas’ many cold cases – unsolved homicides, missing people and unidentified remains – that investigators have struggled to solve as leads dry up and they run out of potential suspects. But families of some of these cold case victims may soon find new hope for answers from an unexpected source: prisoners.  In an effort to turn up new leads, Kansas authorities developed a deck of playing cards featuring 52 of the state’s cold cases – each card displaying a victim’s picture, a short description of their case and a tipline number. The Kansas Department of Corrections says that it began distributing the cards over the last week to people incarcerated in the state’s prisons and county jails, in the hopes that some might know something about the cases and submit tips. “Not every tip received leads to resolution of a case, but someone usually knows something,” state Secretary of Corrections Jeff Zmuda said when the program was announced. “Within Kansas correctional facilities and jails, we have segments of our population who want to do something good, perhaps atone for past mistakes, and they may have information about unsolved cases.”  Cold case card decks have been used in more than a dozen states, with some eliciting tips that revived stalled investigations, led to convictions and brought resolution to families who grieved for years without answers. Winston’s loved ones were blindsided by his killing, telling CNN he was a dedicated father and aspiring entrepreneur who was widely liked. His mother and his girlfriend, Valyn Burrell, said they want justice for his six children, whom he adored and devoted most of his free time to. “I don’t get it. Whoever did it knew he had kids. They knew he had family. I don’t understand,” Miller said. Families of victims featured in Kansas’ card deck described to CNN a torturous wait for resolution, with some also fearing for their own safety as the killers remain uncaught.  But they all agree on one thing: someone, somewhere knows what happened. And they hope the playing cards may be the final push that brings them forward. “One day, somebody’s going to talk and we’re going to get that break. And I hope I’m alive and on this earth to see that,” Burrell said.   The boy who begged to stay home    For more than three decades, Elizabeth Geer Jones and Melissa Bowell have agonized over what drove someone to kill their 11-year-old brother, Nelson Louis Jones.  They remember him as an adventurous boy who radiated mischievous, playful energy and led them in activities like jumping from the family shed and swinging like Tarzan from a garden hose he tied to a tree.  But on the evening of October 29, 1990, one of his sisters walked into his room and found him strangled to death.  It’s a day they go over in their minds, struggling to make sense of the moment that upended their lives. On the morning of his death, the sisters remember Nelson talking their mom into letting him stay home alone for the first time while the family visited a greyhound racing track in Wichita, about an hour and a half away.  When they returned home that evening, they called out for Nelson and received no answer. Thinking he may have gone down the street to a school carnival, they set off to search for him, but he wasn’t there. Finally, one of the sisters checked his room.  The sisters were just 9 and 10 at the time of Nelson’s death, which spurred a grief they said their mother never got over. “From the time my brother was murdered on, my sister and I did not have a happy childhood,” Geer Jones said.  Nelson is the youngest victim in Kansas’ cold case cards, and the sisters are hoping a break in his case could hold someone accountable for his killing and bring them a long-awaited peace. “It would put my heart at ease because my mom passed away not knowing, and I know that’s the one thing she truly wanted was to know who murdered her son,” Geer Jones said.   Bowell thinks knowing who did it might give their family a chance to understand why Nelson was killed – bringing them a small amount of resolution.  “I wonder if that person has a conscience?” Bowell said. “Do they realize what they’ve done? Not just in taking the life of a child, but I felt like we lost our mom that day too.” A grandmother ‘paralyzed’ by uncertainty  For a long time after Alex LaRussa disappeared, his grandmother Colleen Greenemeyer said she could hear his voice call out as she drove past the Solomon and Smoky Hill Rivers that stretch alongside Interstate 70.  “I would swear that I would hear him talking to me saying, ‘Grandma find me, find me. I’m here,’” she told CNN.  LaRussa went missing from Salina, Kansas, in December 2017. About a month later, police found his car abandoned by a river in a nearby town with his cell phone, clothing and wheelchair inside. He has never been found.  Before his disappearance, LaRussa had been struggling to mentally and physically recover from having his leg amputated that summer. For much of LaRussa’s life, his grandmother watched out for him, at times bringing him to live with her and trying her best to keep in touch as he went in and out of jail, mainly on burglary and theft convictions.  Greenemeyer recalls her grandson chasing his dream of playing football while he lived with her. When he went to prison, she said he took up reading, asking her to send him packages of books. After LaRussa went missing, Greenemeyer moved out of her dream home about an hour away and returned to Salina to be close to her daughter, determined to find out what happened. When she got there, she said she became overwhelmed with grief. “You truly are paralyzed,” she said. “And it’s really disheartening because I moved up here thinking that I can help or get to the bottom of this – that I would do this, this and this, and we would find out and I would be persistent. And I couldn’t do it, either.” Without the solace of knowing what happened to her grandson, she has been forced to sit with the harrowing possibilities that flit through her mind. “I would love to have him to come knock on my door but I’m almost positive in my heart, to the depths of my being, that’ll never happen,” she said. “If [we] knew he was gone, somebody killed him and they were going to pay for it, the relief would be unbelievable. Just unbelievable. You know, we can get a stone and put it somewhere for him and honor it. Have some place to put flowers.” Like other cold case family members CNN spoke to, Greenemeyer has worried for her family’s safety. They believe LaRussa may have been harmed and for a long time after his disappearance, they feared whoever may have done so would target them next.  As the cold case decks are given to prisoners, Greenemeyer is hopeful her grandson’s time in prison will increase the chances that someone who picks up his card will recognize him and come forward with information.  “I believe there are people, yes, that know exactly what happened to him. They’re just not talking,” she said. “My fear is that I’m not going to know before I die. I’m 72 years old and I’m not in good health. … That is the biggest fear I have is not knowing.” Cards have a record of success While it’s difficult to quantify how many cold cases have been solved because of prison card decks, officials in Florida, Connecticut and Oklahoma told CNN their decks have undoubtedly led to prisoner tips that helped solve several cases.  In Connecticut, which has made five editions of its card decks, investigators have received more than 800 tips from prisoners and more than 20 cases in the decks have been solved, according to Supervisory Assistant State’s Attorney John Fahey, who oversees the state’s cold case unit.     “Getting their loved one on that deck and hoping a tip comes in that is able to generate other leads is the hope that that family holds onto,” Fahey said.  Florida no longer has a cold case card program, but the state had almost immediate success when it released its first decks in 2007. Within a year, investigators were able to make arrests in two of the deck’s cases after receiving tips from prisoners, Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesperson Jeremy Burns confirmed.  One of the cases was that of 53-year-old James Foote. An easygoing man with a good sense of humor, Foote could talk to anybody, his family told CNN. Foote was retired and living in Florida with his family at the time of his death. In retirement, he began to obsessively pursue hobbies like fishing, golf, and – at the time of his death – karaoke.   On the night of November 15, 2004, Foote was on his way into a bar for a night of karaoke when someone shot and killed him. After months of investigation, detectives in Fort Meyers ran out of new suspects and the case went cold. After nearly three years of trying to coax out new leads, authorities received a letter from a prisoner who saw Foote’s playing card. Investigators would learn that at least four prisoners had heard a man named Derrick Hamilton bragging about killing Foote.  In October 2007, Hamilton was arrested in connection with Foote’s killing. He pleaded no contest to a second-degree manslaughter charge and was sentenced to four years in prison. Foote’s wife, Donna Foote, describes the years of waiting for answers as “torture,” but she believes the playing cards were vital to the case being solved.  “I don’t know if it would have been solved any other way,” she said. “I totally give all the credit to the cards.” CNN’s Amanda Jackson contributed to this report.",Melissa Jones;Colleen Greenemeyer;Donna Foote;Elizabeth Geer Jones;James Winston;James Winston;James Foote;James Foote;Amanda Jackson;Sherby Miller;Valyn Burrell;Valyn Burrell;Derrick Hamilton;Nelson Louis Jones;Jeremy Burns;Elizabeth Wolfe;Jeff Zmuda;Nelson Jones;Melissa Bowell;John Fahey;Geer Jones;Geer Jones;Geer Jones;Alex Larussa;Alex Larussa,Kansas Department Of Corrections;Florida Department Of Law Enforcement;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4341;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,438;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,993;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,5372;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,35;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1327;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,2843;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,35;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1327;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2843;KILL,550;KILL,8229;ARREST,107;ARREST,1400;ARREST,7900;ARREST,8706;ARREST,9252;ARREST,10146;",Kansas;Oklahoma;Connecticut;Wichita;Florida
78,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/california-store-owner-shoots-robbery-suspect/,"An attempted convenience store robbery by a suspect wielding an assault-style rifle was foiled when the 80-year-old owner grabbed a gun and opened fire, authorities said. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department said deputies were called to the business on Sunday around 2:47 a.m. following a report of an attempted armed robbery. Surveillance video obtained by CNN shows a man entering the Norco Market & Liquor store and pointing a rifle at the owner behind the counter. The owner then reaches for a firearm and shoots the suspect. The sheriff’s department said the owner fired a single round from a shotgun, which caused the suspect to flee. “A lawfully armed member of our community prevented a violent crime and ensured their own safety, while being confronted with multiple armed suspects,” the department said. The owner, who did not want to be identified to protect his privacy, told CNN he had seen an armed man approaching the store moments before he entered. Surveillance footage outside the store shows another armed man get out of a parked SUV and move toward the store just before the injured suspect runs back to the vehicle, apparently screaming “he shot my arm off.” Authorities said one suspect was later found at a Southern California hospital suffering from an apparent shotgun wound. He remains hospitalized in critical, but stable condition, the sheriff’s department said, noting he will be booked into jail after he is released from medical treatment. Three other people in the SUV were arrested and booked on robbery and conspiracy charges, the department said, adding authorities found multiple stolen firearms inside the stolen vehicle.  They were arraigned in court Wednesday and entered pleas of not guilty, a spokesperson for the Riverside County District Attorney told CNN.",,Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"ARREST,1469;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,1469;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1381;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1786;TAX_FNCACT_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY,1844;GENERAL_HEALTH,1303;MEDICAL,1303;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1303;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,734;TAX_WEAPONS_SHOTGUN,635;TAX_WEAPONS_SHOTGUN,1338;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,213;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,573;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,1416;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,213;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,573;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1416;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,161;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1238;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1640;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,161;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1238;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1640;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,161;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1238;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1640;SOC_GENERALCRIME,740;SURVEILLANCE,360;SURVEILLANCE,1027;WOUND,1149;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1149;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1149;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,43;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,344;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,1576;TAX_WEAPONS_FIREARM,537;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1844;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,266;CRISISLEX_C05_NEED_OF_SHELTERS,670;TRIAL,1720;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1182;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1697;TAX_WEAPONS_FIREARMS,1671;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,394;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,963;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,1077;TAX_WEAPONS_GUN,133;",California;Norco;Riverside County
375,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/us-sanctions-alina-kabaeva/,"The US Treasury Department on Tuesday sanctioned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reputed girlfriend as part of a series of measures targeting Russian elites in the Biden administration’s latest attempt to punish the Kremlin for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Alina Maratovna Kabaeva, who has been romantically linked to the Russian leader, was sanctioned “for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the Government of the Russian Federation,” a Treasury Department statement said. That statement describes the 39-year-old Kabaeva as having “a close relationship to Putin.” She is a former member of the State Duma “and is the current head of the National Media Group, a pro-Kremlin empire of television, radio, and print organizations.” In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that sanctioning Kabaeva was under consideration by the US, but there was concern that such a move would inflame tensions given her close proximity to Putin. Kabaeva was previously sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In addition to Kabaeva, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against a number of other oligarchs, a major steel production company and two of its subsidiaries as well as a financial institution accused of running a sanctions evasion operation and its general director.  Separately, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions on three oligarchs, a Russian state-owned company overseen by the Ministry of Transportation, “four individuals and one entity illegitimately operating in Ukraine’s territory in collaboration with Russia,” and 24 Russian defense and technology-related entities.  The US is also imposing visa restrictions on 893 Russian Federation officials and “31 foreign government officials who have acted to support Russia’s purported annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine and thereby threatened or violated Ukraine’s sovereignty,” Blinken said. Many of the designations announced by the US target oligarchs who were previously sanctioned by allies like the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the European Union. They come as the war in Ukraine has entered its sixth month.  ‘Opulent lifestyles’ “As innocent people suffer from Russia’s illegal war of aggression, Putin’s allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin’s enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives.” The oligarchs sanctioned by the State Department Tuesday are Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko, and Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy. The yacht AXIOMA was identified as blocked property in which Pumpyanskiy has an interest, the State Department said in a fact sheet. According to that fact sheet, Ponomarenko “is an oligarch with close ties to other oligarchs and the construction of Vladimir Putin’s seaside palace” who has previously been sanctioned by the UK, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Among the oligarchs sanctioned by the Treasury Department Tuesday is Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, the Russian billionaire founder of the chemical company “PhosAgro” and former government official described by the Treasury as “a known close associate” of Putin. He is also sanctioned by the UK, and according to the US Treasury, he “owns the Witanhurst estate, which is the second largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace.” The Treasury Department on Tuesday identified the yacht Alfa Nero, reportedly owned by AG Guryev, as blocked property. AG Guryev’s son, Andrey Andreevich Guryev, was also sanctioned by the US Tuesday, after previously being sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Switzerland, and the UK, as was his investment firm Dzhi AI Invest OOO. Natalya Valeryevna Popova was sanctioned “for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy, and for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of LLC VEB Ventures,” which is a sanctioned entity. She was also sanctioned for being the wife of Kirill Aleksandrovich Dmitriev, the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). Both he and the RDIF were sanctioned in the days following the start of the war.  The Joint Stock Company Promising Industrial and Infrastructure Technologies, “a financial institution owned by the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management,” and its General Director Anton Sergeevich Urusov were sanctioned Tuesday in relation to alleged sanctions evasion.  According to the Treasury Department, “JSC PPIT attempted to facilitate the circumvention of sanctions imposed on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).” The Treasury Department sanctioned Publichnoe Aktsionernoe Obschestvo Magnitogorskiy Metallurgicheskiy Kombinat (MMK), described as “one of the world’s largest steel producers,” the chairman of its board of directors Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov – who has also been sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the EU, Switzerland, and the UK – and two of MMK’s subsidiaries. “MMK is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers, providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation,” the Treasury Department said. The agency has authorized a wind-down period for transactions with MMK and one of its subsidiaries.

411,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/history-refocused/,"These are the surprising and personal stories, lost and hidden in America’s past, hosted by CNN’s Abby Phillip, Suzanne Malveaux, Omar Jimenez, Athena Jones, Ryan Young, John Avlon and more. Knowing these stories might reshape your understanding of the disparities the country faces today.  July 11, 1868 - A former slave claims statewide power during Reconstruction By Channon Hodge, Ken Borland and Frank Fenimore, CNN On April 11, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what would be his last speech from a window at the White House to the crowd below. They had gathered there expecting a celebratory speech on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant just two days earlier.  But that evening, Lincoln’s speech was about Reconstruction, readmitting Louisiana into the Union and a proposal for “giving the benefit of public schools equally to Black and White, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man.” Plantation-owning elites, Southern Democrats and White supremacists, however, would not easily concede political power to those who had so recently been their slaves. That evening among the crowd of listeners was an enraged John Wilkes Booth, who would go on to assassinate the President just three days later at Ford’s Theatre.  For decades after Lincoln’s death, White supremacists would wage a war of intimidation, murder and massacre on anyone, Black or White, who dared covet a share of their power. Yet, Black people persisted.   And between 1865 and 1880, over 1,500 Black men took political office; most not for long, as their efforts were cut down by mobs of violent White men. 1868 Louisiana - African Americans participated in Constitutional Conventions like this across the South where delegates argued over Union demands, drew up new laws and elected new leadership. Oscar James Dunn was one of those determined men. He became the country’s first Black lieutenant governor in Louisiana in 1868 serving under Henry Clay Warmoth on the Republican ticket. Dunn’s first legislative address showed hope and restraint: “As to myself and my people, we are not seeking social equality. That is a thing no law can govern,” said Dunn. “We simply ask to be allowed an equal chance in the race of life.”  Oscar Dunn died mysteriously in office only four years later… The story continues…  1863-1923 - Tulsa was not an isolated incident; The Whitewashing of America By Channon Hodge, Breeanna Hare, Tami Luhby and CNN Staff  As the Civil War neared its end, Union General William Sherman had been convinced that newly emancipated slaves needed their own land to secure their freedom. He issued Special Field Order No. 15, setting aside 400,000 coastal acres of land for Black families and stating that, “…no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside.” A provision was added later for mules. In three months, the potential of Sherman’s order vanished with a single shot. That April, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and in the fall President Andrew Johnson reversed Sherman’s order, allowing Confederate planters to regain the land. It demonstrated a ruthless appropriation that would be repeated for decades to come. Still, Black Americans created pockets of wealth during the Reconstruction years and into the early 20th century. Yet where Black Americans created a refuge, White Americans pushed back through political maneuvering and violence.   “We estimate that there were upwards of 100 massacres that took place between the end of the Civil War and the 1940s,” says William Darity Jr., a Duke University economist who co-authored “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century,” with writer and folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen. “And they take place North and South, East and West.” We looked back through research and news clippings, paying particular attention to around 50 racially charged incidents between 1863 and 1923 when people of color lost property or economic opportunity. The events highlighted here reveal how acts of racial violence of different scope played out across the country and targeted various ethnicities. Historians then helped us examine how and why they had occurred and where we still see the impact today…  The story continues here…  March 1955 - Who gets to represent a movement?  By Brandon Tensley, Skylar Mitchell, Deborah Brunswick, Janelle Gonzalez, Abby Phillip, Jeff Simon and Cassie Spodak, CNN Claudette Colvin did a revolutionary act nearly 10 months before Rosa Parks. In March 1955, the 15-year-old was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a White person on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The teenager and others challenged the law in court. But civil rights leaders, pointing to circumstances in Colvin’s personal life, thought that Parks would be the better representative of the movement. “People said I was crazy,” Colvin recently told CNN’s Abby Phillip. “Because I was 15 years old and defiant and shouting, ‘It’s my constitutional right!’ “  The story continues here…  1968 - 53 years ago a government report about racism shook America By Amir Vera, Bryce Urbany and Cassie Spodak, CNN In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson’s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders – better known as the Kerner Commission – put out a report that attempted to address systemic racism in the US, including police violence against Black people. A Michigan State police officer searches a youth on Detroit’s 12th Street where looting took place in the 1960s. A Michigan State police officer searches a youth on Detroit’s 12th Street where looting took place in the 1960s. The report stated that racism was a major cause of economic and social inequality for Black people and that it was moving the nation toward two societies: “One Black, one White, separate and unequal.” That, coupled with the brutal police treatment of people of color and poverty, helped spark the race riots of the 1960s. At the time, the commission’s findings shocked many Americans because for the first time, “White racism” was noted as a major cause for the unequal status and living conditions of Black Americans, said the commission’s last surviving member, former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris. But the report’s findings and proposed solutions led nowhere. More than 50 years after the report, Harris, historians and policy experts tell CNN that change will only come when the people have the will and the government is truly honest about what must be done politically, socially and economically to address racial inequality. Jelani Cobb, historian and co-editor of “The Essential Kerner Commission Report,” tells CNN that people and institutions already know what the problem is and that the only action that needs to be taken now is actually following the recommendations of the commission, and pay the price that comes with it. “The actions are laid out, you really don’t need more recommendations,” Cobb said. “The fundamental observations (of the commission) have never been acted on.” The story continues…  Can a formula be racist? By Jacque Smith, Cassie Spodak, Jessi Esparza and Natalia V. Osipova, CNN When she first learned about race correction, Naomi Nkinsi was one of five Black medical students in her class at the University of Washington. Nkinsi remembers the professor talking about an equation doctors use to measure kidney function. The professor said eGFR equations adjust for several variables, including the patient’s age, sex and race. When it comes to race, doctors have only two options: Black or “Other.” Nkinsi was dumbfounded. “It was really shocking to me,” says Nkinsi, now a third-year medical and masters of public health student, “to come into school and see that not only is there interpersonal racism between patients and physicians … there’s actually racism built into the very algorithms that we use.” At the heart of a controversy brewing in America’s hospitals is a simple belief, medical students say: Math shouldn’t be racist. The argument over race correction has raised questions about the scientific data doctors rely on to treat people of color. It’s attracted the attention of Congress and led to a big lawsuit against the NFL. What happens next could affect how millions of Americans are treated… The story continues…  The three periods of the KKK ",Claudette Colvin;John Avlon;Andrew Johnson;Fred Harris;Rosa Parks;Rosa

443,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/cbp-fentanyl/,"US Customs and Border Protection has seized a shipment of the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl hidden in pill bottles that was strong enough to potentially provide lethal doses to tens of thousands of people, the agency said. CBP officers in Louisville, Kentucky, detained a shipment Thursday that arrived from India and was manifested as medicine, the agency said. Inspecting officers found five pill bottles, and the pills tested positive for fentanyl properties, CBP said.  The shipment was headed for a residence in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, the agency added. A CBP spokesman said that a total of 100.4 grams of fentanyl was seized. CBP described the amount as “enough to kill 50,200 people” and with a “street value of at least $15,000.” The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that two miligrams of fentanyl can potentially be lethal, depending on a person’s size, tolerance and past usage. “Even though this shipment may seem like a very small amount, remember 2 milligrams of this stuff is lethal,” said Thomas Mahn, the Louisville Port Director. “This seizure showcases the excellent work our officers do every day. This is a dangerous opioid, and our officers were able to prevent this deadly drug from reaching its destination.” Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is stronger and faster-acting than natural opiates like heroin. The increased use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a large surge in overdose deaths in the US in the last decade. In 2021, nearly 108,000 people died of drug overdoses – nearly double the number of overdoses in 2016 – and about two-thirds of those deaths involved fentanyl or another synthetic opioid, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The US government seized enough fentanyl in 2021 to give every American a lethal dose, DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said last year.

There’s plenty to pick apart in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats’ landmark legislation that senators finally managed to pass in marathon sessions over the weekend.  Will the bill live up to its name? That’s debatable. And debate we shall for months to come, on through the midterm elections and beyond.  Here are a few key highlights: RED ALERT RED ALERT, DANGER  DANGER. Did she just say taxes? Nooooo, cry the titans of industry who’ve spent billions in beltway lobbying to make the very idea of raising corporate taxes equal to hating America and freedom and puppies.  The Business Roundtable, a powerful lobby representing American CEOs, said over the weekend that while it supports policies in the bill to encourage clean energy, the minimum corporate tax would suppress domestic investment and “undermine the competitiveness of America’s exporters.”  The American Petroleum Institute, the biggest oil and gas trade group, is also not a huge fan. Shocking, I know. But on Sunday, the free-loving hippies over at Goldman Sachs issued what I like to call an “everyone calm down” report, saying businesses can expect minimal fallout from the tax provisions.  Key points from Goldman Sachs: My colleague Matt Egan has the full story here.   NUMBER OF THE DAY: $525 million Digital media startup Axios struck a deal to be purchased by the family-owned conglomerate Cox Enterprises. The deal, which is expected to close this month, values the five-year-old Axios at $525 million. Axios, founded in 2017, is known for its bulletin-style newsletters and bite-size briefings (hey, that’s our thing!) During the Trump administration, the site had early success with its sit-down interviews with the president and a string of scoops, making it a must-follow among DC policy wonks and New York media nerds (we know what we are).  GET TO WORK  If the bosses are whingeing about a labor shortage, it’s time for the bosses to roll up their sleeves and get to work. That seems to be the message from Qantas, Australia’s flagship airline, which has just asked its senior executives to help fill out the ranks of baggage handlers.  Qantas (note: it’s pronounced KWAHN-tus, as it stands for Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services), is asking at least 100 senior staff to leave their usual jobs for three months to make up for a shortage among the ground crews that handle baggage at the Sydney and Melbourne airports.  “Oi mates, passengers are mad as a bag of snakes and it’s hurting the bizzo, so chuck your lappy in the bin and get ready to av a go at some yakka…” That’s how I, an American, like to imagine the APB from Qantas HQ sounded.  In reality the statement from an airline spokesperson to CNN Business went like this:  “We’ve been clear that our operational performance has not been meeting our customers’ expectations or the standards that we expect of ourselves — and that we’ve been pulling out all stops to improve our performance.” BOTTOM LINE  The labor isn’t new, but it’s also winter Down Under, and that’s brought with it a spike of seasonal flu and Covid cases, per Qantas’ chief operating officer.  Like most airlines, Qantas slashed its workforce in 2020 as it tried to stay afloat during the height of the pandemic. Rehiring has been slowwwwww. Airports and carriers alike have struggled to cope with the rebound in travel demand since then, which is why traveling this summer (or winter, for our Southern Hemisphere friends) has been downright hellish.  QUOTE OF THE DAY “[She’s] wrong. It won’t decrease inflation, it will increase inflation.”  -—John Van Reenen, professor at the London School of Economics If you’ve been snoozing on recent British politics news, now’s a fun/scary time to tune in.  ICYMI: Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned last month (after soooo many scandals) and the frontrunner to replace him is quite a character herself. And her plans to tackle the UK’s inflation problem have left many economists absolutely dumbfounded. My colleague Anna Cooban explains why.  Enjoying Nightcap?

541,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/trump-fbi-search-political-storm-2024-analysis/,"The FBI search of Donald Trump’s Florida resort is an extraordinary, historic development given that it targeted a former President of the United States and set off a political uproar he could use to stoke his likely 2024 White House bid. In the past, political investigations that have threatened Trump have only increased his superpower appeal to supporters. But federal agents on Monday acted on a judge-approved warrant, which suggests they had probable grounds to believe a crime had been committed. They focused on Trump’s offices and personal quarters in his Mar-a-Lago winter residence while the former President was away in New York.  Monday’s search was related to the possible mishandling of presidential documents, potentially some that were classified, that may have been taken to Trump’s home – the subject of one of two Justice Department investigations related to the former President.  The news was one of the most staggering twists yet in the story of Trump, who was impeached twice, incited a mob riot to try to overturn his 2020 election loss and constantly tore at the guardrails of his office and democracy during his single term, and afterward, like no other President. It threatened to inject new toxins into the political life of a nation that is hopelessly divided – with millions of Trump supporters already believing his lies that the 2020 election was stolen – and that on many issues no longer has a common understanding of truth itself.  It also comes with the ex-President itching to launch a 2024 campaign rooted in his false claims of electoral fraud, which his authoritarian rhetoric suggests would present a profound challenge to democracy. That looming campaign will likely feed on the political rocket fuel of a perception among Trump supporters – which he himself created in his statement announcing the search Monday – that he is being unfairly persecuted. Trump seizes on the search to fire up supporters  Trump was quick to put a political spin on the operation, claiming that his “beautiful home” was “under siege, raided and occupied” while complaining that he was a victim of the “weaponization of the Justice system” by Democrats who wanted to stop him from becoming president after the 2024 election. His statement used the same explosive language and sense of grievance that motivated some of his supporters to violence in Washington on January 6, 2021.  “Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before. They even broke into my safe!” Trump said. He did not mention that the search was conducted on the basis of a legally authorized warrant. Early Tuesday morning, Trump shared a new campaign-style video to his Truth Social site declaring “the best is yet to come” and he also has been fundraising off the search. In some ways, his reaction, in itself, read like the opening salvo of a new presidential campaign built around a narrative of persecution by deep-state forces, familiar from the approach of other strongmen leaders around the world. The FBI and Justice Department declined to comment on the search. President Joe Biden was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news, according to a senior administration official.   Without knowing whether Trump had broken any laws, many Republicans picked up Trump’s lead, reacting furiously, demanding the Justice Department explain itself and claiming the ex-President was victim of a political vendetta. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, whose hopes of becoming speaker rely on Trump’s patronage, immediately vowed to investigate Attorney General Merrick Garland if Republicans win the House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections.   Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who’s facing voters this fall, tweeted: “Using government power to persecute political opponents is something we have seen many times from 3rd world Marxist dictatorships But never before in America.” Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, wrote on Twitter: “We need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.” The instant reactions supportive of the former President, more testimony to his enduring power within the Republican Party, were also an early sign how this investigation will face extreme political pressure. Those responses may also show that the ex-President’s potential 2024 campaign could benefit from the rallying effect of a government investigation that he can portray as politicized and unfair – and that potential GOP rivals may have little option but to rally around too. But the magnitude of Monday’s events should not be underestimated, even if the question of whether the former President was in real danger of being charged with a crime – in what would be a stunning, historic step – was not immediately clear on Monday night. The exact parameters of the search warrant were also not available. Presidents have the capacity to declassify sensitive information, and it was not clear whether Trump might have taken such steps with the material involved. Former Presidents do not have such powers, however. CNN reported that boxes of items were taken by the FBI after the search on Monday. And Trump’s attorney, Christina Bobb, said the bureau seized “paper” after what she said was “an unannounced raid.” A most sensitive decision  Taking such action against any major political figure would be highly delicate. Given Trump’s status as a former commander-in-chief, it is especially grave. And the ex-President’s history of inciting anger and violence makes this about as sensitive a move as is possible to make.  It is clear that the top levels of the Justice Department and the FBI would have signed off on the decision to search Trump’s resort – in full knowledge of the explosive political reverberations that were certain to be unleashed. “I cannot overemphasize … how big of a deal this would have been within the Department of Justice and the FBI,” former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said on CNN on Monday evening.  “This is something that would have been planned out and reevaluated and legally examined from every possible angle by the entirety of the leadership structure of both organizations,” McCabe, a CNN law enforcement analyst, said. Given the political implications, there is no room for error for the Justice Department or for the FBI, whose director, Christopher Wray, is a Trump appointee. There was never a doubt that Trump would react to the search by lighting a political touch paper. His false claims that the 2020 election was stolen have already helped incite an insurrection.  The stakes for the investigators and for the country’s political future are, therefore, enormous. Those implications would only become more critical if it later emerges that the FBI search was not conducted by the book or was not critical to the nation’s national security. The political sensitivities are so acute that it is easy to see how a failure to prosecute Trump after taking such a public step would raise questions over whether the search was justified. That said, in order to secure a warrant to search Trump’s property, FBI officials would have had to prove to a judge that there was probable cause to believe that a federal crime had been committed and that evidence of such could be obtained at the resort. Trump faces multiple investigations  The Justice Department has two known active investigations connected to Trump, one on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the events surrounding January 6, 2021, and the other involving the handling of classified documents. This search appears to be linked to the latter investigation. The National Archives, which is responsible for collecting and sorting presidential records, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some that were classified. Members of Trump’s former White House team have frequently said that he was careless or contemptuous of the legal requirement to archive all presidential documents and cavalier with classified information. Earlier Monday, newly revealed photos, which New York Times reporter and CNN contributor Maggie Haberman is publishing in her forthcoming book, showed documents apparently in Trump’s handwriting that he allegedly tried to flush down the toilet. News of the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago comes after CNN first reported last week that the former President’s lawyers were in discussions with the Justice Department in connection with its investigation into the events in Washington surrounding the Capitol insurrection. Trump may also have some legal jeopardy in a separate probe in Georgia into attempts by the former President and his aides to overturn Biden’s election win in a critical swing state.  Monday’s search at Mar-a-Lago also comes against the backdrop of the House select committee’s investigation into the Capitol insurrection, which has uncovered damning new evidence about Trump’s attempts to steal the 2020 election and his failure to try to stop the violent assault on the Capitol once it was underway. The committee has not yet said whether it will recommend criminal action against the ex-President by the Justice Department. While Democrats might take comfort in a sense that legal problems are piling up for the former President and serious criminal investigations are getting ever closer to a GOP presidential favorite, they might do well to remember the history of attempts to call him to account. The then-President managed to wriggle clear of the Robert Mueller investigation, even though the special prosecutor noted multiple strange links between his 2016 campaign and Russia and compiled a list of occasions when many outside observers considered he tried to obstruct justice. Trump’s two impeachments in the US House – for trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden ahead of the 2020 election and over the insurrection – did not result in convictions in Senate trials or any efforts to bar him from future federal office. His extraordinary support among grassroots Republicans makes it all but impossible for politicians who want a political future to oppose him. And it doesn’t seem like anything but a clear criminal case against the ex-President could turn his supporters against him – and even that might not change their opinion of him if he responds with the right rhetoric. That is even more true after FBI agents crossed a Rubicon on Monday by entering Trump’s pride-and-joy residence in a move that will have massive political implications, however the investigation eventually turns out.

336,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/asia/china-pelosi-taiwan-military-drills-intl-hnk-ml/,"Within minutes of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landing in Taiwan on Tuesday night, China said it would immediately begin “a series of joint military operations around the island,” including using long-range live ammunition in the Taiwan Strait. An announcement from the People’s Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command said beginning Tuesday night a series of exercises would be held on the sea and in the air surrounding Taiwan, the self-governed island that China says is its sovereign territory. “This action is a solemn deterrent against the recent major escalation of the negative actions of the United States on the Taiwan issue, and a serious warning to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces seeking ‘independence,’” Col. Shi Yi, spokesman for the Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement.  The Eastern Theater is one of the five joint commands of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with jurisdiction over China’s eastern coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, which sit opposite and above Taiwan. China’s Defense Ministry said the PLA was “on high alert and will launch a series of targeted military operations to counteract the situation, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart the interference of external forces and ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist schemes.” In an unusual move, Chinese state media posted on Twitter a map showing six areas around Taiwan where it said the PLA would conduct drills, including live-fire exercises from Thursday through Sunday. The announcements came after a US Air Force plane carrying Pelosi landed in Taiwan’s capital of Taipei, marking the first time a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. China did not specify what the exercises would entail or what units would be involved. The PLA has been active with exercises around the region in the days leading up to the Pelosi visit. It typically stages drills at this time of year to mark Army Day, the founding of the PLA.  Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said in a statement that the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.” “Our discussions with Taiwan’s leadership will focus on reaffirming our support for our partner and on promoting our shared interests, including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the statement said. The House speaker wrote an op-ed that published in The Washington Post after she landed, arguing that her trip demonstrated the US commitment to Taiwan under threat from China. “In the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s accelerating aggression, our congressional delegation’s visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom,” Pelosi wrote. The US supplies Taiwan with defensive weaponry under the terms of the decades-old Taiwan Relations Act, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion – a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” China’s ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, told CNN’s John King that Beijing was within its sovereign rights to take action over Pelosi’s visit. “China has every right to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are fully justified to do what we must. The current situation is created purely by the US side, so of course it has to bear the responsibilities,” Qin said.  Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said 21 Chinese warplanes made incursions into its air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Tuesday, the day of Pelosi’s arrival. The incursions were made by 10 J-16 fighter jets, 8 J-11 fighter jets, one Y-9 electronic warfare aircraft, one Y-8 electronic intelligence aircraft, and one KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, the Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday night. In response, the Taiwanese military issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor the activities, it added. China frequently sends warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ.  The highest number of incursions ever recorded was on October 4 last year, when 56 military planes flew into the area on the same day. An ADIZ is unilaterally imposed and distinct from sovereign airspace, which is defined under international law as extending 12 nautical miles from a territory’s shoreline.",John King;Nancy Pelosi;Shi Yi,China Defense Ministry;Us Air;Taiwanese Defense Ministry;Army Day;People Liberation Army Eastern Theater;Cnn;Cnn;Chinese Communist Party;United States;United States;United States;People Liberation Army;People Liberation Army;Taiwan Ministry Of National Defense,"USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2127;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2760;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,2127;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,2760;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2245;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1373;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1373;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1373;MEDIA_MSM,4067;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,3960;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,4045;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,2710;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,3194;UNREST_NATIONAL_SELF_DEFENSE,2900;USPEC_POLICY1,3146;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3146;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,407;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,749;SOVEREIGNTY,1193;SOVEREIGNTY,3387;ARMEDCONFLICT,3637;ARMEDCONFLICT,4188;MILITARY,307;MILITARY,885;MILITARY,1963;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BEAR,3540;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,2716;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,4458;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4458;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,4458;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1470;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1929;DEMOCRACY,2270;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,2270;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,39;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,1686;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,2499;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1391;TAX_FNCACT_KING,3254;LEGISLATION,4458;EPU_POLICY_LAW,4458;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_PEOPLE_LIBERATION_ARMY,307;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_PEOPLE_LIBERATION_ARMY,885;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_LIBERATION_ARMY,307;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_LIBERATION_ARMY,885;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1361;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2700;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,3128;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,3627;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1361;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2700;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,3128;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,3627;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,2661;",Taiwan;Qin Gang;Taiwan Strait;Zhejiang;United States;America;Chinese;Washington;Fujian;Beijing;Taipei;Taiwanese;China

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority announced the 30-day shutdown of the Orange Line Wednesday, the agency said in a news release. Last month, a fire on a train prompted the evacuation of 200 people in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the rescue of one person who escaped by jumping into the Mystic River, CNN previously reported.  The train fire was caused by a piece of metal that runs along the base of the train coming loose, according to the agency. A month later, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority General Manager Steve Poftak says the shutdown will allow the agency to make major progress. “We’ve listened to our riders, and we hear them loud and clear – bold action needs to happen in order to improve the MBTA at the pace that riders deserve,” Poftak said. “We can eliminate slow zones, prevent unplanned service disruptions, and increase the reliability of our service. Perhaps most importantly, we will provide the quality of safety and service that our riders deserve.” The Orange Line stops at 20 stations and over 121,000 feet of track, according to the transportation agency.

250,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/kinzinger-cipollone-subpoena-trump-doj-2020-cnntv/,"Former White House counsel Pat Cipollone having been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury is “probably bad” for former President Donald Trump, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the two Republicans serving on the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, said Wednesday. Kinzinger told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day” that the subpoena likely signals that the Justice Department’s investigation has a “very deep interest” in what Trump did.  “I hope Pat Cipollone actually just tells the truth. I have no doubt that he hasn’t. But there is no reason to protect particularly criminal behavior, what could potentially be criminal behavior behind executive privilege,” the Illinois Republican said. “So we’ll see where this goes. But there is no doubt that this investigation has developed further along than where we even knew it was or thought it was a few months ago.” CNN reported Tuesday that the former White House counsel had been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to a source familiar with the matter. The revelation marks a significant escalation in the department’s probe into the plots to subvert the 2020 election. Cipollone and his attorneys are in discussions about an appearance before the grand jury, including how to deal with executive privilege issues, the source said. “I think in terms of their negotiations, obviously the Justice Department knows better what they can go around when it comes to saying executive privilege. And so I hope they, you know, go at that judiciously,” Kinzinger said. Cipollone testified last month in a closed-door interview with the January 6 committee, and in its seventh public hearing, the panel played clips where he agreed with other Trump officials that there was insufficient evidence of election fraud and said that he believed Trump should have conceded the election. Kinzinger declined to get into details Wednesday of whether the January 6 committee and the Justice Department are cooperating related to Cipollone’s testimony to the panel.",Donald Trump;Adam Kinzinger;Pat Cipollone;Pat Cipollone,White House;White House;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,204;ELECTION_FRAUD,1984;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,370;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1590;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2140;WB_840_JUSTICE,370;WB_840_JUSTICE,1590;WB_840_JUSTICE,2140;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,812;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1477;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1672;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,395;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,927;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,395;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,927;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,395;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,927;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,395;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,927;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,395;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,927;NEGOTIATIONS,1566;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,1566;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,1566;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1566;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,1566;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1566;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,1566;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,1566;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,1377;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1535;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,740;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,786;CORRUPTION,1984;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,1984;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,1984;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,848;LEADER,144;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,144;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,144;TRIAL,107;TRIAL,1138;TRIAL,1438;ELECTION,1187;ELECTION,1348;ELECTION,1978;ELECTION,2048;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,521;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,601;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1929;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,23;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1071;",White House;Illinois
54,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/health/chicago-autism-spectrum-services-community-cnnheroes/,"In the spring of 1989, Debra Vines found her 18-month-old son, Jason, staring ahead blankly in his crib, as if he was in another world. Alarmed, she and her husband rushed him to the hospital.  After visiting several doctors, they eventually got a diagnosis: autism.  Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 44 children in the US is on the spectrum. But in the 1980s, only roughly four in 10,000 children were identified as having autism. “I had never heard of autism outside of Rain Man,” Vines said, referring to the hit movie that had been released a few months earlier. “I got books, I went to the library, but I still felt lost – like I just wasn’t a great mom.” As Jason got older, Vines had to contend with his frequent tantrums and occasionally violent behavior that children with autism may exhibit. Her family moved from Chicago to Maywood, a small, predominantly Black suburb, hoping there would be more services, but the assistance lagged far behind that of more wealthy communities. Vines says she was desperate for support. “My whole life revolved around finding services for Jason. To be able to get any type of assistance I had to take a train, plane, bus, and a magic carpet to get there,” she said. “Multiple cocktails of medication, changing doctors, changing hospitals. And most of it I did alone because my husband worked nights. I felt totally helpless.” The support groups that she did find were in affluent communities. Not only was it hard for her to get to without a car, but when she did arrive, she felt out of place. “I was the only Black woman there, I was the only person that had low income,” she said. “The women – they were great. They were giving me resources. But they would say, ‘They only cost $500.’ And I’m trying to figure how I’m going to get groceries for next week. Imagine how I felt then – even more helpless.” Ultimately, Vines sought solace in drugs. “I was a functioning addict. I still kept red lipstick on. I was still his mom. You still saw Jason with me everywhere I went,” she said. “I kept things moving.” She eventually ended up in prison, and after she finally got clean in June of 2005, she had found her mission. “I made a vow that I wouldn’t want any parent to have to experience what I’ve been through,” she said. In 2007, Vines and her late husband, James Harlan, created The Answer Inc., a nonprofit that supports families in underserved communities who’ve been impacted by autism. To date, Vines says the group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families in the Chicago area. “Families are always asking questions, and we want to provide the answers,” she said. “I would say 95% of everything that we provide is a blueprint of what I was missing as a parent.” Many of those who Vines supports are from Black and Brown communities – a demographic known to face hurdles in the diagnosis and treatment of autism. The CDC reports that Black and Hispanic children are less likely to be identified with the condition,  and researchers at Boston University found that Black children are five times less likely to receive early intervention services than white children – due in part to racial bias and cultural stigma.  Vines is working to change that. Once children have been diagnosed, she helps connect families with the information and services they need, especially within the school system. Her organization also provides parent support groups, a 24-hour helpline, and a host of activities for individuals impacted by autism. At the heart of the group’s programming are the free and low-cost classes held every Saturday at a local community center. These include tutoring, exercise, dance, nutrition and even a social skills class for young women that covers topics like relationships and sex education. Open to individuals of all ages with autism – as well as those with intellectual or developmental disabilities – these programs give students a valuable chance to socialize while giving their caregivers a much-needed break. It’s been a long road, but Vines is confident she’s found the right path. “Jason has taken me places that I never thought that I would go,” she said. “But (he) made me grow up to a woman that I never thought that I would be.” CNN’s Kathleen Toner spoke with Vines about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: Your organization has evolved to provide many services. How did it start? Debra Vines: My work started to primarily support the moms because women want to be able to talk about what they’re going through. We learn from each other, and having a child with a special need, we carry so much – having to deal with your child screaming or head-butting you, not being able to go anywhere because you can’t find anyone to watch your kid, not being able to work.  A lot of special needs parents don’t have many friends. It’s not that our friends don’t love us, but they stop calling. So, I wanted to tell my story so women wouldn’t fall down that rabbit hole that I’d been in. I wanted to help them be the best they can be for their child. CNN: You now support men as well. Vines: Oh yes, men come to our support groups as well, and we also have a group called “Just for Men.” It’s so funny because my late husband, he would go to some of the support groups with me and then he started saying, “Where are the men?” And so I said, “Well, why don’t you create a space for them?” So he did! They would do nature walks, go to sports bars, go to games. And they ended up talking about their kid, and having solutions for each other, so it was amazing. CNN: You also do a lot to educate the community at large about autism. Vines: People are afraid of what they don’t understand. We have a lot of children that don’t have great social skills, and with the numbers growing with autism, we want to make sure that the community is totally educated – the churches, department stores, legislators. And there’s so much that has gone on with police officers with our special needs community. For instance, Jason had a medication meltdown where he was very, very violent. And I had to call the ambulance. The fire department called the police. And they came in with guns drawn. I’m telling them all the time, “There’s no weapons. My son has autism.” They weren’t hearing anything. So, we want to make sure that the first responders are trained, and I’m proud to say that just about every village within the Proviso Township (in Illinois) has been trained on the signs and symptoms of autism. Advocacy is a gift. I’m good at it, and it makes me feel so good. That’s my high now. Want to get involved? Check out The Answer Inc.’s website and see how to help.

607,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/europe/brittney-griner-russia-jail-sentence-whats-next/,"After a Russian court sentenced WNBA star Brittney Griner on Thursday to nine years in prison for a drug smuggling conviction, the player’s supporters, teammates and numerous US officials swiftly condemned the decision, many concerned her detention is being used to advance Russia’s agenda in the Ukraine war.  Now, Griner has returned to the detention center where she was held during her weekslong trial as her lawyers vow to appeal the sentence and the Biden administration continues to try to negotiate for her release.  Russian officials “are ready to discuss” the prisoners being held by both countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists at a news conference Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.  “There is a specified channel that has been agreed upon by the presidents, and no matter what anyone says publicly, this channel will remain in effect,” Lavrov said, according to RIA Novosti. During the trial, Griner pleaded guilty to carrying less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage as she traveled through a Moscow airport on February 17. She testified in court she was aware of Russia’s strict drug laws and had no intention of bringing cannabis into the country, saying she was in a rush and “stress packing.”  Her lawyers had hoped Griner’s guilty plea and statements of remorse would result in a more lenient sentence. She faced 10 years for the charges, and prosecutors requested she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail. In addition to her nine-year sentence, Griner must pay a fine of 1 million rubles, which is roughly $16,400. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here,” Griner said in court before the verdict. “I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that that is far from this courtroom.” The US State Department has classified Griner as wrongfully detained. The Biden administration has offered to trade a convicted Russian arms dealer in exchange for Griner and another American detainee, Paul Whelan, CNN has reported. After the verdict, Griner’s agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, tweeted, “Today’s sentencing of Brittney Griner was severe by Russian legal standards and goes to prove what we have known all along, that Brittney is being used as a political pawn.” President Joe Biden called the sentence “unacceptable” and demanded she be returned to the US to be reunited with her family, according to a statement.  Here’s what comes next for Griner as she awaits her lawyers’ appeal and the US continues to negotiate for her release. Lawyers will appeal ‘unreasonable’ verdict Griner’s legal team will file an appeal to the court’s decision, which it must do within 10 days of the verdict, according to her lawyers, Alexander Boykov and Maria Blagovolina, who is a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. “We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in a statement.  They called the verdict “absolutely unreasonable” and insisted the decision “contradicts the existing legal practice” in Russia.  The average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole, Blagovolina told reporters. During the trial, the lawyers argued Griner’s detention was handled improperly. Griner testified she was made to sign documents she did not fully understand and was not given adequate translations of the Russian-language paperwork.  A defense expert also testified the examination of the vape cartridges containing the cannabis oil did not comply with Russian law.  US has proposed prisoner swap for Griner’s return  The Biden administration has proposed a prisoner swap, offering to exchange a convicted Russian arms trafficker for Griner and Whelan, CNN has reported. Whelan, a US citizen and former Marine, was handed a 16-year prison sentence in 2018 on espionage charges after a trial the US deemed unfair.  After Griner’s sentence, National Security Council coordinator John Kirby said it was “up to the Russian side” on whether the conviction will open the door for prisoner-swap negotiations.  After the US proposed a prisoner swap, Russia countered by requesting convicted murderer Vadim Krasikov also be released, sources familiar with the discussions have told CNN. The US has not considered the counter as a legitimate proposal, in part because the request was made through an informal backchannel. Kirby reiterated Thursday the US position remains it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul (Whelan) and Brittney home.” While US officials have long opposed prisoner trades, the successful release in April of Trevor Reed, an American and former Marine who was imprisoned in Russia, garnered bipartisan praise from lawmakers and was considered a political win for the Biden administration.  Family and supporters continue to fight for her return The swap proposal follows months of pressure from Griner’s family and members of the basketball community.  The star’s wife, Cherelle Griner, has been outspoken about her desire for US officials to take more substantial action to bring her wife home. Days after Cherelle Griner expressed frustrations in an interview with CNN, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris held a call with her to reassure her they were committed to securing her wife’s release, according to a White House call readout. Griner has also had the steady support of her WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, as well as other members of the basketball community.  Before the start of a game Thursday night between the Mercury and Connecticut Sun, members of both teams linked arms in the center of the court and held a 42-second moment of silence for Griner, who wears 42 on her jersey. After it ended, people in the crowd started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!”  CNN’s Allie Malloy, Chris Liakos, Natasha Bertrand, Frederik Pleitgen, Eric Levenson, Dakin Andone, Travis Caldwell, Jill Martin, Betsy Klein, Kate Sullivan and MJ Lee contributed to this report.

420,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business/tesla-autopilot-california-dmv,"Tesla’s autopilot and self-driving claims are under fire again, this time from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in a complaint it filed on July 28.  The complaint alleges that the company made “untrue or misleading” statements in advertisements on its website by claiming that Tesla vehicles were, or could be, equipped with advanced driver assistance system features.   The Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) advertisements ran in marketing materials on the company’s website “on at least five dates” between May 2021 and July 2022, the complaint said.  They included descriptions such as “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving Capability” and used such wording as “All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go…Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating urban streets, complex intersections and freeways,” the suit said.   Another claim that the California DMV alleged was misleading said, “The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” “These advertisements are a deceptive practice” under California’s Civil Code, the DMV complaint said.   Tesla does not typically respond to requests for comment. Tesla has published disclaimers from as recently as June warning the features still require active driver supervision, which contradict the “misleading labels and claims,” the complaint added.  Tesla’s advertising actions could cause it to temporarily lose its manufacturer license and special plates number in California, the complaint warned.  Data released in June by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found there were 273 crashes in the last nine months involving Tesla driver-assist technologies, caused by either its “full self-driving” software or its precursor, Tesla Autopilot.  Of  497 total crashes studied by the NHTSA, 43% of those caused by driver-assist technologies took place in California, the data found.  Tesla’s Autopilot feature comes standard in all of its vehicles, making it one of the industry’s most commonly used autopilot systems. While Tesla reminds drivers to stay alert while using it, a 2021 MIT study revealed that users who used the system were more distracted and looked away from the road more often than when they were driving without the feature.  Tesla has 15 days to respond to the complaint in order to avoid a default decision. The department said this complaint is separate from an ongoing review of the intended design and technological capabilities of Tesla vehicles. The Los Angeles Times was first news outlet to report the complaint.  CNN’s Matt McFarland contributed to this report.

133,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The highest oil prices in a decade. A renewed government focus on energy security. Huge demand for refining crude so it can be used as fuel. Conditions for Big Oil companies haven’t looked this good in years, and ExxonMobil, Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and Shell\n            \n                (RDSA) plan to ride the wave as long as they can. What’s happening: Exxon\n            \n                (XOM) made nearly $17.9 billion in profit between April and June, almost four times what it earned during the same period in 2021. Apple, for comparison, reported a profit of $19.4 billion last quarter. Chevron booked a profit of $11.6 billion, while Shell earned $11.5 billion.  “Without doubt, our delivery this quarter reflects the macroeconomic environment,” Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told analysts. Breaking it down: Market conditions were a key factor. Exxon noted that in the first quarter, average global oil prices jumped by about $22 per barrel. In the second quarter, they rose another $12, “pushing the benchmark marginally above the 10-year range.” “The strong second-quarter results reflect a tight global market environment where demand has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels and supply has attrited,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods told analysts. “The situation was made worse by the events in Ukraine, which have contributed to increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products.” Refining businesses boomed as capacity remained limited, a problem stemming from cash-saving efforts during the early days of the pandemic. The closure rate of refineries during 2020 was three times the rate seen during the 2008 financial crisis, according to Woods. Exxon will be able to process an additional 250,000 barrels per day in early 2023 once it expands its refinery in Beaumont, Texas. Oil companies are confident enough in the future to keep lavishing shareholders with rewards. Shell announced $6 billion in share buybacks over the next quarter, while Chevron said it intends to repurchase up to $15 billion in stock annually. But this past quarter may have been the high point. Oil prices dropped more than 4% in July as global recession fears took hold, which reduced forecasts for demand. Oil prices fell on Monday after China, the world’s top crude importer, released data showing a weakening manufacturing sector. Demand for refineries could also pull back as drivers, worried about inflation, consume less gasoline. Coming up: The Organization of the Oil Exporting Countries, better known as OPEC, meets later this week to decide on its strategy for September. The United States has called for Gulf states including Saudi Arabia to ramp up their crude production, which could drive prices down further. But it’s not clear the group will accede. “OPEC doesn’t control oil prices, but it practices what is called ‘tuning the markets’ in terms of supply and demand,” Haitham al-Ghais, OPEC’s new secretary general, said in an interview published Sunday by Kuwait’s Alrai newspaper. He said oil markets are currently “very volatile and turbulent.” First grain ship leaves Ukraine port after safe-passage deal The first grain ship to leave Ukraine’s port of Odesa under a UN-brokered deal to ensure safe passage through the Black Sea departed on Monday morning, raising hopes that much-needed supplies could reach the global market and ease pressure on food prices. Details, details: Officials from Ukraine and Turkey confirmed the ship — which is carrying more than 26,000 metric tons of corn to Tripoli, Lebanon — has left port. It’s also moving on satellite vessel tracker MarineTraffic. A total of 5 million metric tons of grain is expected to leave Ukraine each month under an agreement signed in Istanbul last month, which was hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough. Ukraine is one of the world’s top grain exporters. But Russian troops had been blocking key ports, trapping millions of metric tons inside the country. Wheat prices hit an all-time high in March shortly after Russia’s invasion. They’ve since fallen more than 40%, in part due to investor anticipation of a safe-passage deal. Corn prices have dropped roughly 12% since the beginning of March.  But questions about whether Russia will stick to the agreement loom as it continues its campaign of military aggression. “This is such an important step but it is a first step,” the UK’s ambassador to Ukraine tweeted on Monday. “[Russia] now needs to honor their side of this deal and let grain ships pass safely. And they need to stop burning and appropriating [Ukrainian] grain.” US stocks just had their best month since 2020 US stocks just had a blockbuster July, jumping more than 9% to notch their best month since November 2020. But you’d be forgiven if you didn’t feel like the market was experiencing a huge rally. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index, which tracks investor sentiment, remains in “fear” territory. Investors are still obsessed with inflation, interest rate hikes from central banks and, crucially, the threat of a recession, both globally and in the United States. “There are still quite a lot of commentators describing this as a bear-market rally,” strategists at the Dutch bank ING noted on Monday. Still, there are signs some players are willing to put more money on the table. The S&P 500 rose during four out of five trading sessions last week. Bank of America, which tracks fund flows, observed the largest inflows into US stocks in six weeks. Investors have decided that the Federal Reserve may go less hard on raising interest rates than previously expected. Yet there’s plenty of debate about whether this is the correct read of the Fed’s messaging last week. “Investors clearly chose to cherry-pick [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell’s dovish comments and ignore his hawkish ones,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients.

503,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/fauci-threatened/,"A man was sentenced Thursday to more than three years in federal prison for sending threatening emails to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. Thomas Patrick Connally Jr., 56, was sentenced in US District Court in Maryland to 37 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He had been arrested by authorities in West Virginia and charged last year with threats against a federal official and interstate communication containing a threat to harm. In his plea agreement, Connally admitted to sending a series of emails threatening to harm and/or kill Fauci and his family through an encrypted email service based in Switzerland. The investigation revealed that the encrypted email account was associated with Connally, the Justice Department said. Fauci started receiving the threatening messages to his work email at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland in December 2020, the first of which came with the subject line: “Hope you get a bullet in your compromised satanic skull today,” according to the complaint.  One of seven emails that Connally sent to Fauci in a day read: “You and your entire family will be dragged into the street, beaten to death, and set on fire,” according to the complaint. Connally also sent threatening emails to Dr. Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services. He admitted he sent the threats to Fauci and Collins with the “intent to intimidate or interfere with the performance of their official duties and with the intent to retaliate against Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins for performing their official duties, including discussing COVID-19 and its testing and prevention,” the Justice Department said. “Everyone has the right to disagree, but you do not have the right to threaten a federal official’s life,” US Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron said in a statement. “Threats like these will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”  Fauci, who also is chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, was forced to beef up security in 2020 as death threats increased amid the Covid-19 pandemic.",Francis Collins;Anthony Fauci;Thomas Patrick Connally Jr;Rachel Levine;Joe Biden,National Institute Of Allergy;Human Services;National Institutes Of Health;Us District Court;Us Department Of Health;Justice Department;Justice Department,"TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,1431;TAX_DISEASE_INFECTIOUS_DISEASE,146;WB_1415_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE,146;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASES,895;TAX_DISEASE_ALLERGY,873;TAX_FNCACT_FEDERAL_OFFICIAL,412;TAX_FNCACT_FEDERAL_OFFICIAL,1930;VIOLENT_UNREST,1214;RETALIATE,1673;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1774;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,2235;ARREST,320;SOC_GENERALCRIME,320;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,320;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1869;DISASTER_FIRE,1214;LEADER,2142;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2142;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2142;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,412;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1635;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1735;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1930;TAX_DISEASE_INFECTIOUS,138;TAX_DISEASE_INFECTIOUS,886;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,1341;GENERAL_HEALTH,146;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,146;WB_1406_DISEASES,146;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,146;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,146;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1491;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,665;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,665;WB_840_JUSTICE,665;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,665;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,665;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,665;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,665;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2121;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2244;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2244;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2244;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2244;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2244;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,335;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,335;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,335;WB_2026_PREVENTION,1801;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,58;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,260;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,58;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,260;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,58;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,260;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,58;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,260;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,58;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,260;MEDICAL,1378;MEDICAL,1452;MEDICAL,1483;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,2113;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,2129;TRIAL,1949;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1949;KILL,571;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,425;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,10;LEGISLATION,2085;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2085;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,459;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1441;",Maryland;Switzerland;National Institutes Of Health;West Virginia

Follow him on Twitter @GeneSeymour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. The changes that “Star Trek” brought about to the global village sometimes seem as vast and multidimensional as that “final frontier” where several iterations of the Starship Enterprise have boldly gone for more than half a century now.   Most of those changes were far from apparent when what’s now digitally marketed as “Star Trek: The Original Series” premiered in September 1966. It’s true that one of the series’ leads was an extraterrestrial first officer with pointed ears and the eccentric but weirdly familiar name of Spock.  Strange beings from another world weren’t always supposed to be heroes of these shows – that is unless they had secret identities with names like Clark Kent.  And there was the rest of the crew: men and women of different ethnic backgrounds in (more or less) the same uniforms. They weren’t just there for decoration. They had names, faces and crucial roles to play every week.   Perhaps the most striking of these support crew members was the cool, sultry, supremely self-possessed Lt. Nyota Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols, still a relative newcomer to television.  Nichols died Saturday at age 89, and the sadness over her passing has been widespread enough to show how much impact she had in a science-fiction show that lasted only three seasons.   Just begin with the effect of her presence on the Enterprise bridge. To repeat, it was 1966, and at about that time, the civil rights movement that helped bring about transformative legislation such as the Voting Rights Act a year earlier had given way to the rise of the Black power movement whose advocates sought greater participation in the nation’s political and economic life. Racial tensions were thick.   Yet the sight of a poised, physically commanding Black woman riding aboard a galaxy-spanning spaceship suggested to viewers, especially younger ones, that somehow the uncertain present would give way to a promising, perpetually challenging future and that, somehow, we were going to work our way out of racial troubles and reach for more distant stars.   Maybe you had to be there. But “Star Trek” and every movie, cartoon, book and series it spawned remains a beacon of hope. And Nichols’ Uhura played a significant role in lighting that beacon even if, after the first season and the show’s so-so ratings, she wasn’t sure it was worth another go-round. She was discouraged by her lines being cut from some of the episodes and was ready to move on to the Broadway stage.   And she would have left if she hadn’t met a die-hard “Trek” fan at an NAACP fundraiser in Hollywood: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.   King, Nichols remembered, insisted on meeting her. He told her that he and his family enjoyed watching “Trek” and rooted for her playing a non-stereotypical Black character. She thanked him but said she was on her way out.  “You cannot and must not!” Nichols recalled in her autobiography King saying. “Don’t you realize how important your presence, your character is? Don’t you see? This is not a Black role, and this is not a female role… You have broken ground. For the first time, the world sees us as we should be seen, as equals, as intelligent people – as we should be.”   Nichols was persuaded – as who wouldn’t be. She stayed for the remaining two seasons, gradually expanding her presence to the point that in the show’s third season, she and series star William Shatner as Capt. James T. Kirk had an unprecedented on-camera interracial kiss.   As with the other cast members, Nichols figured “Trek’s” cancellation in 1969 was the last of it. But the show found multitudes of viewers in syndicated reruns that led to voicing a Saturday morning “Trek” cartoon series, appearances at “Trek” conventions all over the world and performances in six “Trek” feature films in from 1979 to 1991.   Nichols also recognized her importance as an inspiration and role model for young Black people whose dreams of space science and travel were emboldened by her character’s futuristic adventures. She did promotional work for NASA, including an early public service announcement for the maiden voyage of the space shuttle Enterprise.   Life for Nichols wasn’t all about Uhura. She popped up in several feature films, including as Cuba Gooding Jr.’s mother in “Snow Dogs” (2002), and she won a Daytime Emmy nomination for her 2017 guest appearance on “The Young and the Restless.”   But her larger and likely most enduring legacy can be gauged by the number of astronauts of color who flew into orbit on now-mothballed space shuttles and still log hundreds of hours aboard the International Space Station, either inside doing experiments or outside performing repairs. Their successes became real because Nyota Uhura helped make them seem less impossible than they once did.   Martin Luther King Jr., that unlikeliest of Trekkies, had it right.

109,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/kfile-maryland-attorney-general-9-11-conspiracies/,"The Republican Party’s nominee for Maryland attorney general hosted a series of five radio shows in 2006 devoted to arguing in support of 9/11 conspiracy theories questioning if the terror attack was the work of an “elite bureaucrat” who had demolition charges in every building in New York City and even suggesting if those who died after a hijacked plane hit the Pentagon were killed elsewhere.  Michael Peroutka, a candidate best known for his ties to neo-Confederate organizations, made the remarks on The American View, a radio show he co-hosted, in October 2006 while discussing the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.   “What happened on 9-1-1, I told you that I had been doing some research and watching some videos,” Peroutka said during one of the episodes reviewed by CNN’s KFile. “And I said that if the buildings in New York City, the World Trade Center buildings, came down by demolition charges – that is to say – if there was this evidence that there was that something was preset there, then the implications of that are massive,” said Peroutka. “I’ve been doing some reading and doing some studying, and I believe that to be very, very true,” he added, before further suggesting the work was done by controlled explosives.   “The other thing that just is so striking to me, I can’t get it out of my brain, and that is the vision of Building 7 falling faster than the speed of gravity, right? Building 7, which no plane hit,” said Peroutka. “And all of a sudden Building 7 falls, very consistent with what they call controlled demolitions or controlled charges because that building from the top down falls faster than if you had thrown a hammer off the top of the building.”  Peroutka’s comments echo the widely debunked conspiracy theory that the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center, the smaller building within the vicinity of the towers, were wired with explosives and detonated in a series of controlled demolitions.   The Twin Towers collapsed after terrorist-hijacked planes intentionally crashed into the North Tower and then the South Tower, killing 2,753 people. Nearby “Building 7” suffered intense and uncontrollable fires after debris from the North Tower hit the building, causing a chain reaction that led to the building’s collapse, according to a study published in 2008 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Peroutka went even further with his conspiratorial logic, speculating that every building in New York City could have preset charges awaiting detonation by some “elite bureaucrat.”   “That begs the question that if there are preset charges in Building Seven, what’s to stop there for being preset charges in Buildings 1, 2 8, 9, and 27?” said Peroutka. “Are there charges in every building in New York City? Is everyone ready to be brought down whenever some elite bureaucrat decides that he’s gonna pull it?”   Peroutka also called the 9/11 terrorist attacks an “inside job,” saying “you can’t have an explosion in the basement that’s done by the hijacker on the airplane” and claimed that the official account of the 9/11 attack was the real “conspiracy theory.”    The campaign did not address Peroutka’s previous conspiracy theories when asked for comment, but Macky Stafford, Petroutka’s campaign coordinator, told CNN in a statement that the “primary election results demonstrate that Maryland Republicans are dissatisfied with their current leadership.” But outgoing Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan called out Peroutka on Sunday, saying, “These disgusting lies don’t belong in our party.” “We know who was responsible for 9/11. Blaming our country for Al-Qaeda’s atrocities is an insult to the memory of the thousands of innocent Americans and brave first responders who died that day,” Hogan tweeted.  Peroutka previously ran for president in 2004 as the nominee of the Constitution Party. During that campaign, Peroutka posted on his website an endorsement from the League of the South – a new-Confederate organization that advocates southern secession. The homepage for his campaign prominently featured a Confederate flag linking to “Southerners for Peroutka” whose homepage had a large Confederate flag displayed over the Capitol saying, “We have a dream.” He also promoted his candidacy to the Council of Conservative Citizens, according to copies of their newsletter obtained by CNN. The CCC is a self-described White-rights group that opposes non-White immigration and advances White nationalist ideology.  Peroutka will face Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown in the general election this November. If elected, Brown would be the first Black attorney general in the state. Maryland has not had a Republican attorney general since 1952, when one was appointed; the last Republican attorney general elected in the state was in 1919.   In other episodes of Peroutka’s radio show reviewed by CNN’s KFile, Peroutka also cast doubt that the Pentagon was hit by American Airlines Flight 77, asking where the video is showing this “incoming attack, plane or missile,” later saying that it is “very plausible that a missile that looked like a plane hit the Pentagon.” Peroutka even questioned if remains of the deceased were found at the Pentagon, suggesting they were killed elsewhere. He said he had seen “no evidence” of any bodies or luggage to his late co-host and former presidential campaign adviser, John Lofton.   Lofton said, “Ah, but see the missile thing. Then you gotta count for the remains and the body parts and show how all those people got inside the missile. How all those passengers–”  “I saw the pictures. There was, there was nothing that looked like a body or luggage or anything in there,” Peroutka interrupted. “And the pictures that I saw – if there are pictures, John – that show body parts or luggage or even a seat of an airplane that’s consistent with Flight 77, that particular airplane. If there’s anything that’s consistent with that, I haven’t seen a picture of it.”  Shortly after, Lofton said, “If I can produce for you a person who was a friend or loved one of one of the passengers that perished on that plane that hit the Pentagon, that says, ‘Yes, we got remains back from our loved one or friend.’ Will that impress you?”  “No, absolutely not,” replied Peroutka. “Where did the remains come from? I’m not disputing that the people died.”  “Unless a plane hit the Pentagon, how would the remains of anybody on that flight get into the Pentagon?” asked Lofton.   “I didn’t say they got into the Pentagon. I couldn’t see them in the Pentagon. There wasn’t any – I’ve never seen any evidence that anything like a body or a passenger or passenger’s luggage or anything that’s consistent with the Flight 77 is in the Pentagon. If there are such pictures, I’d like to see them. Now, you could clearly understand that somebody whose loved one was lost on that plane, very possibly, could have gotten some piece of forensic evidence that indicated that their loved one was in fact deceased. But who says that came from the Pentagon?”  Peroutka then said this was the first time he had heard that the remains of the deceased were found at the Pentagon.  American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked by five terrorists on September 11, 2001, and deliberately crashed into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people aboard and another 125 people in the building.

362,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/usda-epa-rural-wastewater-initiative/,"The Biden administration on Tuesday launched an initiative that it hopes will help resolve wastewater issues in 11 poor, rural communities where inadequate disposal is a health risk to residents. The Closing America’s Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative, launched under the US Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency, is set to be unveiled by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu in Lowndes County, Alabama, one of 11 communities that are part of the initiative.  The majority-Black rural county is located between Selma and Montgomery in the “Black Belt” region. Many have residents in the county have long struggled with inadequate sewage disposal and wastewater. Septic systems and other wastewater systems are crucial for disease prevention and help remove bacteria, parasites and other viruses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “President Biden has been clear – we cannot leave any community behind as we rebuild America’s infrastructure with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” Landrieu said in a statement. “This includes rural and Tribal communities who for too long have felt forgotten.” Vilsack said the agency recognizes there are “people who have been going without the basics,” adding that “access to modern, reliable wastewater infrastructure is a necessity.” Regan echoed Vilsack and said opportunity for historically marginalized communities is “stolen when basic sanitation doesn’t work” when people are exposed to “backyard sewage and disease.” The initiative will aim to help “communities access financing and technical assistance to improve wastewater infrastructure to ‘close the gap’ with wealthier communities,” the USDA said in a release.  The initiative will also allow both agencies to work with the communities, state government, tribal groups, and others to obtain financial and technical skills to tackling wastewater improvement. The communities and tribes will get additional support for wastewater issues by also getting help with wastewater solution plans and funding opportunities, according to both agencies. It says it will also allow both agencies that work with the 11 communities, state and Tribal partners, on-the-ground technical assistance providers, “to leverage technical and financial expertise to make progress” on tackling wastewater improvement. The communities and tribes will receive support to address wastewater issues through efforts that include creating wastewater community solution plans, wastewater assessments with technical engineering support, and pursing funding opportunities, according to both agencies. Other communities and tribes that part of the initiative include: Greene County, Alabama; Harlan County, Kentucky; Halifax and Duplin counties in North Carolina; Raleigh and McDowell counties in West Virginia; San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona; Doña Ana County and Santo Domino Pueblo in New Mexico; and Bolivar County in Mississippi. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocates $55 billion to upgrade water infrastructure, including replacing lead service lines, and devotes funding to improving access to clean drinking water, wastewater and stormwater.  The law also allocates $11.7 billion in loans and grants through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund to address wastewater infrastructure challenges. The initiative is going to allow communities the opportunity to receive these funds, both agencies said. In places like Lowndes County, where the median income was nearly $34,000, according to the latest US Census Bureau data, many residents have faced sewage flooding their yards and homes for decades. In parts of the county without access to a sewer system, some residents rely on private septic tanks if they can afford it and get assistance from organizations such as the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program (BBUWP), which helps low-income families that can’t afford a wastewater disposal system.  Residents also resort to homemade wastewater disposal systems, such as a straight-piping from the toilet to the ground, Sherry Bradley, the director of Bureau of Environmental Services for the Alabama Department of Public Health, told CNN. Bradley, the environmental adviser for the BBUWP, said the non-profit organization can help install the septic systems at homes because of a USDA grant and 175-200 homes can get installations through the group, according to the group’s website. But funding is not enough to resolve wastewater issues and it is “just fixing a problem temporarily,” Bradley said. “It must be the right person to install these systems that know what they’re doing, that’s one reason I decided to step out of my regulatory role and help install onsite systems,” she said, adding that her division regulates the permitting, installation, maintenance and use of onsite sewage treatment systems. “I’ve seen a lot of onsite failures because someone’s brother or neighbor installed a system. Constant training of the homeowner is also needed.” In November, the Department of Justice launched an investigation into whether the Alabama Department of Public Health and the Lowndes County Health Department have put Black residents at a higher risk of disease by failing to properly rid their communities of raw sewage. The investigation in Lowndes County was the first environmental justice investigation the DOJ has conducted under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funding from engaging in discrimination.",Michael Regan;Sherry Bradley;Mitch Landrieu;Tom Vilsack,Department Of Justice;Environmental Protection Agency;Us Centers For Disease;Us Census Bureau;Cnn;Cnn;Alabama Department Of Public Health;Alabama Department Of Public Health;Clean Water State Revolving Fund;Closing America Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative;Us Department Of Agriculture,"UNGP_HEALTHCARE,187;RURAL,132;RURAL,655;RURAL,1231;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ALABAMA,574;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ALABAMA,2859;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ALABAMA,4386;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ALABAMA,5317;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1571;SOC_MARGINALIZE,1549;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1549;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,918;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,918;AGRICULTURE,316;AGRICULTURE,404;WB_149_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_AND_DISPOSAL,4173;WB_149_WASTEWATER_TREATMENT_AND_DISPOSAL,4237;TAX_ETHNICITY_APACHE_TRIBE,3050;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,4916;SANITATION,1593;WB_2000_SANITATION,1593;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,1593;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,5511;LEADER,1045;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1045;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1045;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,350;WB_137_WATER,818;WB_137_WATER,1648;WB_137_WATER,3821;WB_137_WATER,5066;WB_137_WATER,5511;WB_139_SANITATION_AND_WASTEWATER,818;WB_139_SANITATION_AND_WASTEWATER,1648;WB_139_SANITATION_AND_WASTEWATER,3821;WB_139_SANITATION_AND_WASTEWATER,5066;WB_139_SANITATION_AND_WASTEWATER,5511;WB_148_SEWERAGE,818;WB_148_SEWERAGE,1648;WB_148_SEWERAGE,3821;WB_148_SEWERAGE,5066;WB_148_SEWERAGE,5511;WB_1199_WATER_SUPPLY_AND_SANITATION,818;WB_1199_WATER_SUPPLY_AND_SANITATION,1648;WB_1199_WATER_SUPPLY_AND_SANITATION,3821;WB_1199_WATER_SUPPLY_AND_SANITATION,5066;WB_1199_WATER_SUPPLY_AND_SANITATION,5511;WB_2003_SANITATION_TECHNOLOGIES,818;WB_2003_SANITATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1648;WB_2003_SANITATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3821;WB_2003_SANITATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5066;WB_2003_SANITATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5511;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,516;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1950;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1950;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3830;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,2016;WB_470_EDUCATION,2016;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,2016;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,2016;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,4334;WB_840_JUSTICE,5266;WB_840_JUSTICE,5599;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,907;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1011;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1658;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,5452;WB_1406_DISEASES,907;WB_1406_DISEASES,1011;WB_1406_DISEASES,1658;WB_1406_DISEASES,5452;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,907;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1011;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1658;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,5452;BAN,5697;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,5292;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,5530;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,5613;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,5292;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,5530;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,5613;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,3351;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,3468;TAX_DISEASE_BACTERIA,941;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,918;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1032;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,918;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1032;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,918;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1032;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,918;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1032;WB_2026_PREVENTION,918;WB_2026_PREVENTION,1032;WB_2004_ONSITE_SANITATION,1593;UNGP_CLEAN_WATER_SANITATION,1593;GENERAL_HEALTH,182;GENERAL_HEALTH,4414;GENERAL_HEALTH,5345;GENERAL_HEALTH,5388;MEDICAL,182;MEDICAL,4414;MEDICAL,5345;MEDICAL,5388;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,4462;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,446;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,5670;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,5670;WATER_SECURITY,3366;DISCRIMINATION,5759;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,5759;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,474;LEGISLATION,1179;LEGISLATION,3207;LEGISLATION,3403;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1179;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3207;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3403;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,332;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4361;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4454;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5591;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,332;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4361;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4454;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5591;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,713;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,4041;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,5414;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,414;",White House;Mississippi;New Mexico;North Carolina;Black Belt;Raleigh;Alabama;West Virginia;Greene County;Arizona;America;Bolivar County;San Carlos;Lowndes County;Harlan County;Kentucky;Environmental Protection Agency
235,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/biden-still-positive-covid-19/,"President Joe Biden continues to test positive for Covid-19 and will stay in isolation, his physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a new letter released Wednesday.  After taking a five-day course of Pfizer’s antiviral drug, Paxlovid, when he first tested positive on July 21, Biden tested positive for a rebound case of Covid-19 on Saturday and resumed isolation. He has not left the White House in 14 days.  “Given his rebound positivity which we reported Saturday, we continued daily monitoring. This morning, his SARS-CoV-2 antigen test remained positive. The President will continue his strict isolation measures,” O’Connor wrote in a memo to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, which was shared with reporters. Thursday will mark “day five” of his second isolation. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “People with recurrence of Covid-19 symptoms or a new positive viral test after having tested negative should restart isolation and isolate again for at least 5 days.” On Tuesday, O’Connor said that Biden, 79, was experiencing a “loose cough.” On Wednesday, the doctor updated that Biden is “still experiencing an occasional cough, but less frequently than yesterday.” O’Connor said Biden “enjoyed” a “light workout” Wednesday morning, and his temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation “remain entirely normal.”  During Biden’s first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough, according to his doctor. The President completed a five-day course of Paxlovid, which requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to doctors on May 24 advising that Covid-19 symptoms sometimes come back, and that may just be how the infection plays out in some people, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated or treated with medications such as Paxlovid. The CDC said that most cases of rebound involve mild disease and that there have been no reports of serious illness. Biden is fully vaccinated and received two booster shots. He received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination in March.

212,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/sport/bill-russell-nba-legend-dies-spt-intl/,"NBA legend Bill Russell, an 11-time NBA champion with the Boston Celtics and the first Black head coach in the league, passed away “peacefully” Sunday, according to a family statement from his verified Twitter account. He was 88. “It is with a very heavy heart we would like to pass along to all of Bill’s friends, fans, & followers,” the statement reads.  “Bill Russell, the most prolific winner in American sports history, passed away peacefully today at age 88, with his wife, Jeannine, by his side. Arrangements for his memorial service will be announced soon.” In addition to his sporting achievements, Russell was one of sport’s leading civil rights activists and marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. when he gave his “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963. He also supported iconic boxer Muhammad Ali in his opposition to being drafted into military service.  Former US President Barack Obama took to social media to praise Russell’s contribution to both basketball and society. “Today, we lost a giant. As tall as Bill Russell stood, his legacy rises far higher – both as a player and as a person,” he said. “Perhaps more than anyone else, Bill knew what it took to win and what it took to lead. On the court, he was the greatest champion in basketball history. Off of it, he was a civil rights trailblazer – marching with Dr. King and standing with Muhammad Ali. “For decades, Bill endured insults and vandalism, but never let it stop him from speaking up for what’s right. I learned so much from the way he played, the way he coached, and the way he lived his life. Michelle and I send our love to Bill’s family, and everyone who admired him.”   Russell won 11 championships with the Celtics, including eight straight from 1959 to 1966. He was a five-time NBA MVP and a 12-time All-Star. As a coach for the Celtics, he led Boston to two titles, becoming the first Black head coach to win an NBA championship. “Bill’s two state championships in high school offered a glimmer of the incomparable run of pure team accomplishment to come: twice an NCAA champion; captain of a gold-medal-winning US Olympic team; 11 times an NBA champion; and at the helm for two NBA championships as the first black head coach of any North American professional sports team,” the family statement continued.  “Along the way, Bill earned a string of individual awards that stands unprecedented as it went unmentioned by him. In 2009, the award for the NBA Finals most valuable player was renamed after two- time Hall of Famer as the ‘Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.’ “Bill’s wife, Jeannine, and his many friends and family thank you for keeping Bill in your prayers. Perhaps you’ll relive one or two of the golden moments he gave us, or recall his trademark laugh as he delighted in explaining the real story behind how those moments unfolded. And we hope each of us can find a new way to act or speak up with Bill’s uncompromising, dignified and always constructive commitment to principle. That would be one last, and lasting, win for our beloved #6.” The Celtics issued a statement lauding Russell and his contribution to both the team and the sport as a whole. “To be the greatest champion in your sport, to revolutionize the way the game is played, and to be a societal leader all at once seems unthinkable, but that is who Bill Russell was,” the statement read. “Bill Russell’s DNA is woven through every element of the Celtics organization, from the relentless pursuit of excellence, to the celebration of team rewards over individual glory, to a commitment to social justice and civil rights off the court. Our thoughts are with his family as we mourn his passing and celebrate his enormous legacy in basketball, Boston, and beyond.” Fellow NBA legend Michael Jordan – widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time – said, “Bill Russell was a pioneer – as a player, as a champion, as the NBA’s first Black head coach and as an activist. He paved the way and set an example for every Black player who came into the league after him, including me. The world has lost a legend. My condolences to his family and may he rest in peace.” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver also shared his condolences. “Bill Russell was the greatest champion in all of team sports,” Silver said in a statement. “The countless accolades that he earned for his storied career with the Boston Celtics – including a record 11 championships and five MVP awards – only begin to tell the story of Bill’s immense impact on our league and broader society. “Bill stood for something much bigger than sports: the values of equality, respect and inclusion that he stamped into the DNA of our league. At the height of his athletic career, Bill advocated vigorously for civil rights and social justice, a legacy he passed down to generations of NBA players who followed in his footsteps. Through the taunts, threats and unthinkable adversity, Bill rose above it all and remained true to his belief that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity.” CNN’s Homero de la Fuente contributed to this report.",Adam Silver;Michael Jordan;Barack Obama;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Bill Russell;Muhammad Ali,Twitter;Cnn;Cnn,,American;Philadelphia;Boston

244,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/kansas-abortion-amendment-analysis/,"The wording of the question was convoluted, but the answer was crystal clear: No. Voters in Kansas on Tuesday, in dramatic numbers and by an overwhelming margin, rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion in the state. As Republican-controlled state legislatures around the country race to outlaw the procedure in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, traditionally conservative Kansas, given the chance to directly respond at the ballot box, denied their own elected leaders’ the chance to revoke a right that has broad support across swaths of independent polling. The rejection of the measure highlighted the increasingly stark divide between the activities of Republican state lawmakers, often in legislatures gerrymandered to effectively guarantee GOP control, and the political and policy desires of American voters. In more immediate terms, the ballot measure’s defeat – on a day of extraordinary turnout – also provides a clear indication that the desire to defend abortion rights could be a potent issue for Democrats in the coming midterm elections. The polling, from a variety of sources, is unambiguous and consistent. Across party lines, abortion rights are popular and the Supreme Court’s ruling is not. The most recent CNN poll found that 63% of Americans disapproved – 51% “strongly” – of the court’s decision. The Kaiser Family Foundation came to a similar conclusion, with 61% of respondents to their survey saying they wanted their state to guarantee access to abortion. Only 25% wanted them to restrict it.  The backlash, and its translation to concrete political terms, could potentially influence elections in a handful of states this fall – including in liberal states like California and Vermont, where the big ticket results are close to a formality but the energy of Democrats could tip races down the ballot. The more dramatic downstream effects could be felt in swing states like Michigan – which is embroiled in a court battle over whether a ban from 1931 should be reinstated – and Colorado, where measures addressing abortion are likely to appear on the same general election ballot as key contests for governor and US House seats. In Kansas, there was hardly a contest to speak of. The “No” coalition – which opposed a measure that would have removed abortion rights from the state constitution – appears to be on track to win in a landslide. And it’s no low-turnout fluke. The overall vote count on the amendment eclipsed 869,000 at around 1 a.m. ET.   That figure exceeded Kansas’ general election turnout in the midterm year of 2010 and was approaching the 2014 total overnight. And overall primary turnout in the state two years ago – in the midst of a presidential campaign – clocked in at just over 636,000. In the 2018 midterm primary, the figure was lower: 457,598.     Interest in the ballot measure also heavily outweighed the other big statewide contests on Tuesday – more than doubling the total votes cast in the Republican gubernatorial primary, won by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, according to a CNN projection, with about 350,000 votes as of early Wednesday morning.  Democratic turnout was even lower – another sign that the abortion issue transcends party lines. Fewer than 250,000 voted in the party’s Senate primary and only a few thousand more punched ballots for incumbent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who faces an uphill battle to win a second term.  President Joe Biden, in a statement released after the results became clear, piled on. “The Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade put women’s health and lives at risk,” he said. “Tonight, the American people had something to say about it.” While Kansas got their word in, millions of Americans in other states are unlikely to have a similar opportunity – at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, Republican leaders and anti-abortion activists in several states are locked in court battles as they push to implement all manner of new restrictions or preexisting “trigger laws” over the objections of abortion rights groups, many of whom are arguing that those measures violate existing state law or constitutional protections. How the Kansas vote resonates in those states remains to be seen. But even before Tuesday night’s thunderclap, there have been hints that even GOP heavyweights are disinclined to escalate the fight.  Conservative Govs. Ron DeSantis in Florida and Kristi Noem in South Dakota, both believed to be harboring national ambitions, praised the Supreme Court’s ruling, but have not yet pushed forward with demands from anti-abortion activists for more aggressive action – like the calling of special legislative sessions to pass more or more aggressive laws. Similar quasi-impasses exist in states like Nebraska and Iowa. The reasoning behind those decisions has been parsed out and officials like DeSantis have pointed to existing or pending laws, but the broader trend is clear: abortion rights, now as before, are broadly popular across party lines.

It’s shed 6.5% against the US dollar, holding its ground as the greenback has gone on a breakneck rally. The euro, the British pound and South Korea’s won have all dropped more than 10%, while Japan’s yen has plunged nearly 16%. But US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s controversial trip to Taiwan is reminding investors of the risks that come with holding renminbi. What’s happening: Pelosi’s high-profile visit to Taipei, where she asserted on Wednesday that Washington would “not abandon” the democratically governed island, has fed fears of a further deterioration in the relationship between China and the United States, the world’s two biggest economies. Beijing quickly said it would launch live-ammunition military drills around Taiwan and suspended imports of natural sand and some fruit and fish. China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner. The flare-up in tensions has fed concerns among investors that the situation could escalate from here, either intentionally or inadvertently. China’s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its own, despite never having controlled it. China’s offshore yuan has pulled back slightly this week. “It’s something investors have known about for a while as a potential flash point,” Manik Narain, head of cross-asset strategy for emerging markets at UBS, told me. “It’s been very hard to trade it. We don’t know if it will be a flash point tomorrow or in five years’ time.” One big unknown: If China were to launch a military confrontation, would Western countries impose harsh economic sanctions, as they did when Russia invaded Ukraine? What would that mean for foreign investors if they did? “They can see what happened to Russian markets,” Narain said. “Investors don’t want to be making that same mistake twice.” Excising China from the global economy would be a near-impossible task given its integration with supply chains, the importance of the market to large Western corporations and the country’s manufacturing might. But the threat of such a significant geopolitical breakdown looms. It’s not the only factor weighing on China’s currency. Emerging markets are struggling to attract investments as US interest rates rise, which makes parking money in higher-risk locations look less attractive.  There are also questions about China’s economic growth. Factory activity contracted in July, according to data released last weekend. A global recession would hurt the country’s robust export machine. And domestic demand remains shaky, as the country deals with the aftershocks of recent Covid-19 lockdowns in major cities and a vulnerable real estate sector. “At a time when exports will likely run out of steam soon on weaker global demand, China’s domestic demand recovery is unlikely to materialize soon, in our view, given continued Covid curbs and recent shocks to the property market,” Bank of America economists Helen Qiao and Miao Ouyang said in a research note this week. Plus, as the economy stutters, the People’s Bank of China is on track to ease policy while most other central banks are tightening it. That could add to downward pressure on the yuan. “The pace at which the US raises interest rates could be crucial,” Narain said, noting the potential for a sharp “divergence.” Inflation anxiety isn’t crimping the gig economy Demand for Ubers and Airbnbs is at an all-time high as consumers snap up shared homes and rides despite concerns about the rising cost of living. The latest: Airbnb said Tuesday that it logged 103.7 million bookings between April and June, a new quarterly record and a 24% jump compared to the same period in 2019. The spike in bookings generated revenue of $2.1 billion and a profit of $379 million.  The company also benefited from higher average daily rates. At $164, the rate was down slightly compared to the first three months of 2022 but up 40% versus the same period in 2019. Still, shares are off 6% in premarket trading after the company’s outlook was worse than Wall Street expected. Uber’s revenue, meanwhile, hit $8.1 billion last quarter, more than double the year prior. It also reported positive cash flow for the first time ever, meaning it took in more money from its operations than it spent. Going strong: The number of consumers and drivers using Uber are “at all-time highs,” the company said, pointing to a shift to more spending on services like dining out and attending live events. There are about 122 million people utilizing the platform each month, up 21% from the prior year. Uber also said it’s making progress on enrolling more drivers to reduce wait times, with sign-ups rising 76% year-over-year in the United States. “We’re not where we want to be, but they’re certainly moving in the right direction,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts. Know this stat: Wait times in the United States now average four-and-a-half minutes, down from between five and six minutes. Uber’s shares leaped 19% on Tuesday. Rival Lyft also rode the wave, climbing more than 16%. The pandemic is still hammering dating apps People may be shedding their sweatpants, ditching Zoom and hopping into Ubers much as they did before Covid-19 entered the scene. But some singles are holding back. Match Group —the biggest owner of dating apps in the world, with a portfolio that includes Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid — said on Tuesday that the pandemic is still affecting user behavior and hurting its business.  “While people have generally moved past lockdowns and entered a more normal way of life, their willingness to try online dating products for the first time hasn’t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,” CEO Bernard Kim said in a letter to investors. Engagement from pre-existing users is up. But attracting fresh recruits remains a challenge. Investor insight: Revenue grew 12% year-over-year last quarter to $795 million, missing Wall Street’s expectations. It also posted a surprise operating loss of $10 million. Shares are down 21% in premarket trading. They were already 42% lower so far this year. Kim said the company will attempt to turn the tide by making changes to its product and incorporating more features like livestream video. He also sees huge potential for growth in Asia, pointing to last year’s acquisition of South Korea’s Hyperconnect.

249,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-trip-consequences-analysis/,"Whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s risky trip to Taiwan was a valuable statement of US resolve or provoked China for no strategic gain depends on when, or if, Beijing’s consequent fury and military posturing abate. Pelosi visited legislators and President Tsai Ing-Wen on the democratic self-governing island on Wednesday, giving her hosts the trappings of a nation-state visit sure to enrage the Chinese. Her trip to Taipei – which she wrapped Wednesday, departing the island for South Korea – has already caused uproar in tense US-China relations, with the communist giant sending jets to the edge of Taiwanese air space and launching military exercises that sent an unsubtle message that Taiwan is surrounded.  However, if these eruptions stop short of a full-scale crisis in the Taiwan Strait, a vital strategic waterway, and avoid the possibility of miscalculations between Chinese and Taiwanese forces, or even Chinese and US assets in the region, the storm over Pelosi’s mission could be temporary. The imagery of the US House speaker bolstering a democracy under China’s giant shadow could become one of the signature moments in US Asia-Pacific foreign policy.  The geopolitical relationship between Washington and Beijing is the most important nation-to-nation clash on the globe. It is unfolding as a generational tussle between two civilizations keen to imprint their values, economic systems and strategic hegemony on the rest of the world. While the Biden administration has followed the Trump White House in treating China as an adversary rather than as a competitor, the prime goal of US policy is still to avoid what could be a disastrous future war between the two nations. So if Pelosi’s visit – a personal rebuke to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has made the takeover of Taiwan an existential quest – permanently worsens already poor US-China relations and brings forward what some see as an inevitable superpower confrontation, it might turn out to be a massive miscalculation. The same will be true if her trip prompts Beijing to take steps that rock the peace and prosperity enjoyed by the Taiwanese in their dynamic island home, a factor often ignored by China hawks taking tough stands to bolster their political position in the US. What Pelosi achieved  From the speaker’s perspective, the trip has gone well so far. She captured the attention of the world for days before arriving on a US military plane. A female political icon, she defied the all-male top echelons of the Chinese Communist leadership and refused to be bullied – and sat down with another pioneering female leader, President Tsai. She made a stirring stand for democracy – a core American value.  And Pelosi bookended a political career that saw her unfold a pro-democracy banner in Beijing in 1991 with an anti-Chinese Communist Party tour de force in Taiwan as fears grow China may eventually try to take the island by force. More broadly, she demonstrated to China that the United States would not back down to apocalyptic rhetoric from Beijing and that it would operate where it wants in the Asia-Pacific region, whatever the rising regional superpower thinks about it. “In the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) accelerating aggression, our congressional delegation’s visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom,” Pelosi said in a Washington Post op-ed published as she reached Taipei. If this proves to be Pelosi’s last major foreign mission as speaker, with the Democrats at risk of losing the House in November, it will not be quickly forgotten.  While the trip caused concern among the foreign policy establishment, her journey got strong support on Capitol Hill, where backing for the island runs deep, as does hostility toward China. Unusually, Republicans warmly praised the speaker, although some may have been motivated by a desire to paint her as tougher than President Joe Biden, who admitted last month that the US military hadn’t been happy about the prospect of her trip to Taiwan.  “We support Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan,” 26 GOP senators said in a statement. “This travel is consistent with the United States’ One China policy to which we are committed. We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.” The Taiwan Relations Act is legislation that is designed to deter a Chinese invasion of the island and commits the United States to sell defensive arms to the government in Taipei. Recently, there have been calls from hawks in Congress for a strengthening of the act and for Washington to end the policy of “strategic ambiguity” under which it is unspecific about what it would do if the mainland invaded. The unintended consequences Pelosi may have set off  Pelosi’s achievements in Taiwan are largely personal, symbolic and short-term.  It did not appear that she said or did anything during her visit that infringed the One China policy, despite claims to the contrary from Beijing. But at one point during her news conference, she praised Taiwan’s people for “the courage to change their own country to become more democratic.” The US does not recognize Taiwan as a country. Whether it was a slip or a deliberate word choice, Pelosi’s comment will be parsed by officials in Beijing. Her trip could harden beliefs among Chinese leaders that Congress is bent on stiffening Taiwan policy – an impression that could pull the diplomatic tightrope over the island’s status closer to a breaking point. While that may not be Pelosi’s intention, misconceptions can drive military escalations in such a volatile foreign policy relationship.  A permanent increase in Chinese military and economic pressure on Taiwan, or a more hostile posture toward US naval and airborne forces, could bring the danger of conflict between the rivals closer. If Pelosi’s visit accelerates Xi’s urgency and resolve in seeking to take over Taiwan by military force, it will also have been counterproductive.  White House officials, who initially expressed concern about Pelosi’s visit, recast their message to stress that she has every right to visit Taiwan, which Beijing considers its sovereign territory, and that her trip did not infringe on any Sino-US deals that state that the People’s Republic is the sole legitimate government of China. But they also appeared to prepare the American people for a prolonged period of escalating steps toward confrontation by China.  While there is no sense that China thinks war with the United States is in its interests, John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, laid out a road map of lesser steps Beijing could take, evoking the way that America and its allies declassified intelligence ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “China appears to be positioning itself to potentially take further steps in the coming days and perhaps over longer time horizons,” Kirby told reporters Tuesday.  He warned provocations could include firing missiles in the Taiwan Strait or around Taiwan and large-scale breaches of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone by warplanes. He said that China might also make public assertions similar to those it made recently to the effect that the Taiwan Strait is not an international waterway.  Critical to global supply chains that are already under pressure following the Covid-19 pandemic, the Strait is traversed by much of the world’s maritime container traffic. Any attempt by China to compromise the sea lanes to increase pressure over Taiwan could have devastating economic consequences – and a deep political impact in the United States and elsewhere. Even talking about disrupting the Strait could send global markets plunging, exacerbating pain for Americans already struggling with the high cost of living in an inflation crisis that threatens to doom Democrats in the midterms.  “Some of these actions would continue concerning trend lines that we’ve seen in recent years, but some could be of a different scope and scale,” Kirby said. With that in mind, it’s fair to ask whether Pelosi’s visit achieved anything that is worth a possible much longer-term deterioration in the security environment around Taiwan that could bring the US and China closer to conflict. “I agree she had the right to go. The question is whether it makes good sense,” said Phil Mudd, a former FBI and CIA official who is now a CNN counterterrorism analyst. “She can go, but why? What is the upside?” Former US Ambassador to China Max Baucus, meanwhile, told CNN International’s Richard Quest that in the context of a dangerously worsening US-China relationship, Pelosi’s trip was unwise. “My view, frankly, is that she should not have gone. The goal of US foreign policy is to reduce tensions with China, not increase tensions,” the former Democratic senator from Montana said. “Her visit clearly is increasing tensions. There is no foreign policy reason for her to go. The Taiwanese know that we support them.” In China, as well as the US, domestic politics may be creating a dangerous moment over Taiwan – a trend the visit from the California Democrat may have only

356,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/tiktok-lawmakers-explainer/,"Two years after then-President Donald Trump said he would ban TikTok in the United States through an executive order, the short-form video platform is once again under scrutiny in Washington. And the underlying issue remains largely the same: TikTok’s ties to China through its parent company, Bytedance.  A growing number of US lawmakers are calling for the Biden administration to take action against TikTok, citing apparent national security and data privacy concerns. The criticism stems from a Buzzfeed News report in June that said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China. The reporting cited leaked audio recordings of dozens of internal TikTok meetings, including one where a TikTok employee allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.”  In a response to the report, TikTok previously said it “has consistently maintained that our engineers in locations outside of the US, including China, can be granted access to US user data on an as-needed basis under those strict controls.” A TikTok executive testified before a Senate panel last year that it doesn’t share information with the Chinese government and that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China.  The renewed pressure on TikTok comes as the platform’s influence continues to grow in the United States. After Trump left office, the Biden administration revoked the executive order and largely walked back official attempts to ban TikTok. Last year, TikTok said it topped 1 billion monthly active users globally, and more than 100 million users are said to be in the United States, according to some market research estimates. Activity on the app continues to shape the news cycle, popular music, culinary trends and more in the country. Meanwhile, other US social media giants continue to imitate TikTok’s features in an effort to compete. Some critics previously blasted Trump’s crusade against the fast-growing video app as political theater rooted in xenophobia, and called out Trump’s odd suggestion that the United States should get a “cut” of any deal if it forced the app’s sale to an American firm. But the latest round of pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle shows how the national security issue continues to plague TikTok in the United States, even under a new administration.  Here’s what you should know about the latest scrutiny of TikTok and Bytedance along the Beltway.  What lawmakers are saying about TikTok A range of US lawmakers and officials have in recent months called for new investigations into TikTok’s data storage practices or even for the app to be yanked off US app stores.  A coalition of GOP senators led by Tom Cotton of Arkansas sent a letter in June to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calling for answers about actions the Biden administration is taking to combat the “the national security and privacy risks posed by TikTok.” A separate group of Republican senators led by Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee also sent a letter of questions to TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew. The senators said the recent media reports “confirm what lawmakers long suspected about TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance — they are using their access to a treasure trove of US consumer data to surveil Americans.” Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence urged the Federal Trade Commission to formally investigate TikTok and ByteDance. “In light of repeated misrepresentations by TikTok concerning its data security, data processing, and corporate governance practices, we urge you to act promptly on this matter,” the letter signed by Mark Warner of Virginia and Marco Rubio of Florida stated. In a letter, a member of the Federal Communications Commission urged Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr claimed that ByteDance was “beholden” to the Chinese government, and “required by law to comply” with the Chinese government’s surveillance demands. The letter was widely reported on, despite the fact that the FCC has no role in overseeing app stores. In a letter responding to Blackburn and others, Chew said: “We have not provided US user data to the [Communist Party of China], nor would we if asked.”  How TikTok has responded Amid the recent uproar, TikTok announced that it has moved its US user data to Oracle’s cloud platform so that “100% of US user traffic” is now hosted by the cloud provider, potentially addressing national security concerns. In his letter to lawmakers, which mentioned the shift to Oracle, Chew said the broader goal for the company’s data security efforts is to build trust and “make substantive progress toward compliance with a final agreement with the US Government that will fully safeguard user data and US national security interests.” Chew didn’t name any specific groups within the US government, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has been investigating TikTok since 2019. The government body, however, has not provided any recent updates on its investigation. Citing anonymous sources, Reuters recently reported that CFIUS has been in “extensive discussions with TikTok on security issues.” Representatives for CFIUS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok also recently pledged to offer researchers more transparency about activity on the platform, including access for a select group to its API, or application programming interface.  “We know that just saying ‘trust us’ is not enough,” TikTok chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas said in a blog post announcing the planned update. “That’s why long ago we made an important commitment to transparency, particularly when it comes to how we moderate and recommend content.” Why the national security concerns won’t go away While TikTok has long pushed back at the national security concerns as “unfounded,” the concerns persist.  “The fact that the Chinese government, if it really wants to, can make any company in its borders comply with data access requests, I think is really at the root of a lot of these concerns about TikTok,” said Justin Sherman, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative.  “There are real national security questions being asked,” Sherman added, but there are also issues with galvanizing much of the conversation around anti-China rhetoric. Focusing too narrowly on the national origin of an app’s owner, or just on a single company, only looks at one way that data can be accessed, Sherman said. As a result, it loses all the other ways that data flows through advertisers, brokers and much more.  “It’s good to have this kind of attention” on data privacy and security issues, Sherman said. “But if all you’re doing is writing letters about specific companies and not actually writing and testing laws and regulations to control for risks, in the long run, nothing’s really going to change too much.” ",Janet Yellen;Vanessa Pappas;Marco Rubio;Mark Warner;Brendan Carr;Marsha Blackburn;Justin Sherman,Google;Communications Commission;Senate Select Committee On Intelligence;Atlantic Council

570,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/homelessness-in-nashville/,"Across Tennessee, pitching a tent on public land outside of designated camp sites is now a felony offense. Tennessee is the first state in the nation to take such a draconian step, but it’s just one of a number of states essentially criminalizing homelessness in an effort to reduce the number of unhoused people sleeping on the streets, at bus stops and in city parks. “They’re trying to run us out of Nashville,” says Momma V as she stood in the mud outside her tent pitched on the banks of the Cumberland River. “We’re out here homeless. We’re trying to struggle to make it and they’re just trying to make it worse on all of us by criminalizing it.” A felony conviction would make it even harder for an unhoused person to find a home or a job. “It’s a huge deal,” says Lindsey Krinks, an outreach worker with Open Table in Nashville. “A felony offense carries up to six years in jail, a $3,000 fine and the loss of voting rights.” Similar bills are now under consideration in Arizona and Georgia. Similar bills were introduced, but failed, in Oklahoma and Wisconsin. A similar bill was passed in Texas last year. A think tank in Austin, founded and funded by a tech billionaire, is the inspiration for much of this new legislation. “The goal of that isn’t to criminalize someone,” says Judge Glock, senior director of policy and research at The Cicero Institute in Austin, who wrote the model bill that the news laws are based upon. “But you need for someone in a severe mental illness, or sobriety or substance use crisis, some sort of stick as well as a carrot to move people onto the next step.” ‘It’s a felony to survive,’ says woman living on state land Later this month another Cicero Institute-inspired law takes effect in Missouri. Camping on public land will be a misdemeanor there, not a felony. But local governments that don’t enforce the camping ban could see their state funding slashed. And money previously earmarked to build permanent housing for the unhoused will be diverted to treatment programs and to build state-sanctioned temporary homeless encampments. “This is a push to put the most vulnerable people, who are citizens, into internment camps,” says Eric Tars, legal director of the National Homelessness Law Center. “What we really need to be focusing on in Tennessee, for example, right now: The state minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. You’d have to make more than double that to be able to afford even a studio apartment in many parts of the state.” In Nashville, average rents have climbed over 40% in just the past five years. Taneesha Green, who has lived for a year on a sliver of state land on a Nashville roadside, says the police have already told her she needs to move on.  “They said it will be an action. We will go to jail,” she says. “It’s a felony to survive.” Green says she has nowhere else to go. Testifying before lawmakers in Georgia, Glock said denizens of homeless encampments need a simple message: “We can offer you alternatives, but you have to move,” he said on the state house floor. “You need that. Both the stick and the carrot. And this bill provides those.” Many homeless activists say they do not believe that a “stick” can persuade people to pull themselves out of homelessness.  “It’s hard to pull yourself up by the bootstraps when you don’t even have boots on,” says Howard Allen, who was homeless in Nashville for 17 years.  Glock says ramshackle homeless encampments are bad for the housed, but also bad for the unhoused.  “This is mainly about helping the homeless themselves. Clearly leaving them in these environments is not good for them,” he says. “This is not about helping just the cities.” ‘We know what’s not working,’ says Cicero Institute official The Cicero Institute was founded in 2017 to apply, according to its website, “The innovative energy of America’s leading technologists and entrepreneurs to broken systems in the public sector.”  It’s named for Marcus Cicero, a Roman statesman who died more than 2,000 years ago, and funded by Joe Lonsdale, a young tech billionaire and a colleague of Peter Thiel, the right-leaning political activist and entrepreneur. “We have no influence except the power of persuasion,” Glock says. “We’re merely saying, ‘Here seems to be a better idea. We know what’s not working.’” Something called “Housing First” has become the primary approach to tackling homelessness across the United States. The basic philosophy is this: Find someone a permanent home, not a shelter bed. Offer but don’t mandate addiction and mental health treatment. The rest should follow. Many studies support that approach. The Cicero Institute does not. “It seemed like it just brought everyone in when you try to build free homes,” said Lonsdale, Cicero’s founder, on an episode of his podcast “American Optimist.” “Then we’ll have lots of mentally ill people in small homes in our cities, and they’re still kind of in a bad situation.” Rising rents make it difficult to house the homeless Proponents of Housing First acknowledge the process is not perfect, but they say that’s because of unenthusiastic implementation.  “Housing First is documented to have 90-plus percent retention rates when it works. But we haven’t funded it at the adequate levels,” says Tars from the National Homelessness Law Center. “And in the meantime, everybody’s seen that the rents are going up all across the country.” Including here in Nashville, where luxury condos are popping up as rents rise in a city rebranding itself as a tourist destination. Nashville is trying to be to music what Las Vegas is to gambling: “Nashvegas.” “I came here right after my daughter was born and I pushed her in her stroller,” says Rebecca Lowe, a professional singer, at the gates of Brookmeade Park in her leafy Nashville neighborhood. “I thought better and never came back, and that was more than 10 years ago.”  Walking along a meandering path through what was once a riverside idyll with a little Civil War history on the side, we meet a woman who is clearly high, smell human feces and see mounds of trash, hundreds of shopping carts and a few dozen tents scattered among the trees. Lowe founded a group called Reclaim Brookmeade Park.  “Nothing has been working. Nothing has worked,” she says. Lowe now supports the criminalization of camping. The new bill in Tennessee, which does just that, was sponsored by state Sen. Paul Bailey. He represents a rural district an hour or two east of the state capital. Bailey told us on the phone that the impetus was constituents complaining about burgeoning homeless encampments. “You can imagine an elected official, a constituent comes and says there’s an encampment on my corner, it scares my kids,” says Tars, the homeless advocate. “Your choice is either to deal with this deficit of deeply affordable housing … or you can pass a quick law saying it’s illegal to be on that corner.” Bailey declined an offer of a formal interview, but during a debate about the bill said this: “This bill requires law enforcement give a documented warning for the first incident and any punishment thereafter is up to the prosecutorial discretion of the district attorney. That’s an explanation of the amendment.” The bill passed in the state senate by 22 votes to 10. “I think this is sort of putting a band aid on cancer in a way,” state Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Democrat from Nashville, said during that debate. “I think we need to actually address the fundamental root problem. “It just breaks my heart that we’re criminalizing people who don’t have anywhere else to go,” said state Sen. Brenda Gilmore, another Democrat from Nashville. “We are tasked in the Bible (with) defending the rights of the poor. So, for that reason I will not be voting in favor of this bill.”  Some park dwellers reject shelters Back at Brookmeade Park, Lowe tells us she hopes just the threat of arrest will persuade non-profit groups to provide more housing and fewer services, like food and water, that she believes perpetuate the problem. She says she hopes the threat will force the homeless to help themselves. “If you give them a choice of staying in the park or getting help, they almost always choose to stay in the park,” she says, adding she would support building permanent houses for these people but that’s not practical. “That’s going to take years to build,” she says. In the meantime, she says, the people living in Brookmeade Park should be moved to temporary shelters. Many unhoused people do not want to move to shelters, Momma V among them.  “I can’t have my dogs with me” in the shelter, she says. “And I’m not giving them up.” “I was in a temporary shelter,” says Allen, the homeless man now turned homeless advocate. “And I didn’t like it. Because you are not treated as a human being.” Allen, after 17 years sleeping outside, now has a permanent home.  “When I moved in my house January 11 of last year and they put that key in my hand, I cried,” he says. “And then I cried again because my brothers and sisters deserve the same thing that I have. Housing.

526,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/media/liz-cheney-fox-news-ad-spots/,"Fox News viewers will this week see former Vice President Dick Cheney look into the camera and excoriate former President Donald Trump as the greatest threat to the country “in our nation’s 246-year history.” That’s because Rep. Liz Cheney’s campaign has purchased a series of national ad spots on Fox News to run the viral campaign advertisement she debuted last week featuring her father. The ad shows Dick Cheney lacing into Trump as a “coward” who lies to his supporters and “tried to steal the last election” using violence. At the end of the ad, Cheney endorses his daughter, who is the vice chair of the select House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.  The ad spots started airing Tuesday morning on Fox News and will continue throughout the week. They are scheduled to air twice each day on the morning show “Fox & Friends” and once each day on Sean Hannity’s prime time program — two shows Trump has had a close relationship with over the years. Jeremy Adler, a spokesperson for the Cheney campaign, made it clear in a statement that the the goal is to make a strong statement by airing the spots on the right-wing television channel. Many Republicans get their news from Fox News and the network has shown a strong willingness to turn a blind eye to Trump’s misdeeds during its programming. But such ad spots offer an avenue for politicians like Cheney to still get their message across. “It’s important not only for Fox News viewers, but for the network’s hosts and top executives, to hear former Vice President Cheney’s warning about the ongoing danger Donald Trump and his lies post to our constitutional republic,” Adler said. The move to purchase ad time on Fox News was first reported by Axios. The strategy could be replicated in the future to pierce the information chokehold that Fox News and other right-wing media outlets have on the Republican voting base. Cheney is facing a tough primary race this month in Wyoming against a Trump-backed challenger. Her race is one of the most closely watched primaries of the summer.",Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Sean Hannity;Jeremy Adler;Liz Cheney;Dick Cheney;Dick Cheney;Dick Cheney,,"EXTREMISM,1182;EXTREMISM,1887;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1233;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1893;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1893;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1893;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1042;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,395;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,79;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,709;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,1584;CONSTITUTIONAL,1675;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIANS,1417;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVES,1552;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,480;MEDIA_MSM,1193;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,663;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1924;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1479;LEADER,79;LEADER,141;LEADER,709;LEADER,1584;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,79;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,141;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,709;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1584;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,79;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,141;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,709;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1584;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1684;ELECTION,515;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,25;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,307;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,775;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,882;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,1257;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,1496;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,1736;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,1864;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,530;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,530;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,530;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,177;",Wyoming;New York
76,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/uvalde-arredondo-termination-hearing-delayed/,"A termination hearing to decide the fate of embattled Uvalde School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo has been delayed due to “a scheduling conflict,” the school district said Wednesday. The hearing was set to be held Thursday and has already been rescheduled once from the originally intended date of July 23. The Uvalde school board announced they would consider Arredondo’s termination after the superintendent recommended the chief be fired following his highly criticized conduct during the Robb Elementary school massacre in May.  Arredondo will remain on unpaid leave until a new date and time can be set for the hearing, the school district said in a statement.   The school district police chief has faced withering criticism from officials, families and the public over his handling of the shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers died. Officials have identified Arredondo as the on-scene commander during the massacre, though the chief has said he did not consider himself in charge.  Officers responded to the school within minutes of the shooting beginning on May 24 but waited for over an hour outside adjoining classrooms before finally entering and killing the shooter, according to a timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety.  Calls from victims’ families and Uvalde residents for Arredondo’s termination were fueled by the release of a Texas House Investigative Committee report that outlined a series of failures by responding law enforcement agencies on the day of the shooting. The report said the agencies share “systematic responsibility” for the botched response and concluded that Arredondo failed to assume his pre-assigned responsibility of commanding the incident.   In the report, Arredondo said he “was responding as a police officer” and did not consider himself in charge.  A CNN review of body-worn camera videos from officers on the scene during the shooting shows Arredondo giving orders, coordinating officers and being deferred to by officers confused about their roles or response to the shooting. The video footage, considered alongside other documents released, undermine Arredondo’s claim that he did not consider himself to be in command that afternoon, the CNN analysis shows.   Uvalde school district Superintendent Hal Harrell placed Arredondo on leave from his position as school police chief on June 22. “Because of the lack of clarity that remains and the unknown timing of when I will receive the results of the investigations, I have made the decision to place Chief Arredondo on administrative leave effective on this date,” Harrell wrote in the announcement. Arredondo has rarely spoken publicly about his actions on the day of the massacre, though he did give an interview to the Texas Tribune in which he denied instructing officers not to breach the classroom door and said, “I didn’t issue any orders.” Arredondo has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience. He also served on the Uvalde City Council until he resigned from the position in July in the wake of the shooting.  “After much consideration, it is in the best interest of the community to step down as a member of the City Council for District 3 to minimize further distractions,” Arredondo said in his resignation letter. “The Mayor, the City Council, and the City Staff must continue to move forward to unite our community, once again.” CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz, Matthew J. Friedman, Ray Sanchez, Peter Nickeas, Eric Levenson, Elizabeth Wolfe and Andy Rose contributed to this report.

481,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/oldest-black-church-excavation-project-reaj/,"Beneath the asphalt parking lot of America’s largest living history museum, gravesites linked to one of the nation’s oldest Black churches remained hidden for decades until last year.  Archaeologists in Williamsburg, Virginia, are now excavating three burials at the original location of the historic 18th century First Baptist Church, launching a monthslong process to unearth information about who was buried there and what kind of lives they led.  Last month, the archaeology team fully excavated the first burial of an individual in a wooden coffin and extracted bone for a DNA sample to be analyzed alongside analysis of the skeletal remains. The archaeology team is now working to prepare the second grave for excavation. For the Black descendants of residents in Williamsburg, this effort is long overdue. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Black residents made up more than half the town’s population and members of the church included abolitionists, teachers and farmers. Since 1956, the church’s foundation has been covered by a parking lot owned by Colonial Williamsburg after the museum bought and demolished the structure.  And it was largely forgotten. Throughout the years, visitors to Colonial Williamsburg parked their cars and walked over the foundation. Children would exit school buses on field trips to the 301 acre site dedicated to preserving the history of the Virginia town as it existed in the 18th century to “feed the human spirit by sharing America’s enduring story.” But that history was not inclusive, historians and residents said.  The experiences of Black community members in the colonial era have often been left out, said Connie Harshaw, the president of the Let Freedom Ring Foundation, dedicated to preserving the church’s history. First Baptist Church being buried all these years is a testament to this erasure of history, she said.  “It was an asphalt parking lot for more than 60 years with no regard to the people who lived there and who died and were buried there, whose names we don’t even know,” Harshaw said.  The journey to uncover First Baptist Church’s history began in 2020 with a partnership between Colonial Williamsburg and the non-profit foundation. Talks began in the spring of 2020, and digging began in the summer of 2020, Harshaw said.  ‘A lot of reckoning to do’ Alvene Conyers remembers spending nearly every Sunday at First Baptist Church as a little girl. The 75-year-old Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendant community said knowing the church’s foundation was covered by a parking lot was painful. Her mother, a seamstress, would knit her only the best attire to wear to First Baptist Church, with outfits including corduroy jumpers and ruffle-collared blouses to wear with patent leather shoes.  “I felt devalued and dismissed and just unappreciated as a human being,” Conyers said. “Colonial Williamsburg has a lot of reckoning to do.”  The excavation project is the flagship initiative in Colonial Williamsburg’s efforts to better tell and represent the stories of Black Americans living in Williamsburg in the colonial era, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s director of archaeology. He said the fact that the church was covered by a parking lot is a tragic part of the project’s journey, but hopes the excavation begins to remedy some harm. “We’ve ripped up that parking lot and it will never go back,” Gary said. First Baptist Church was founded in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, Virginia’s colonial capital. Members secretly gathered under trees at a plantation to engage in song and prayer, defying state laws that prohibited Black people from congregating in large groups.  By 1818 there was a building on the lot, referred to on a tax document as the Baptist Meeting House. The original structure of First Baptist Church was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. Over two decades later, in 1856, a new brick church on the site of the first building was constructed and remained there until 1956, when Colonial Williamsburg bought and demolished the church as part of an expansion project, placing a parking lot over the historic location. Payment for the property was used to construct the congregation’s current church that sits about a mile away from the original site.  Today, the church remains active and is on the US National Register of Historic Places. Harshaw said people travel from all over to visit the church, with visitors coming as far as Beirut and Kenya.  “It’s no longer simply a community church. It’s a national treasure and everybody’s coming to see it,” Harshaw said. From demolition to dedication Following a change in leadership, Harshaw said the current president of Colonial Williamsburg reached out to her in March 2020 after she previously met with former Colonial Williamsburg leadership and criticized the museum for failing to highlight the stories of the Black residents.  After having conversations with the president about telling a more complete story about Williamsburg history that centered on the Black experience and the church’s cultural and historical significance, Harshaw said the excavation project commenced soon after when the parking lot was ripped up in August 2020.  Last year, following about a year of excavating the site, archaeologists discovered the church’s original permanent structure, a 16- by 20-foot brick foundation atop a layer of soil that dates back to the early 1800s, according to the museum. Archaeologists also identified multiple gravesites.  Although Harshaw said she had no idea there were intact burials on the site, she said some other members of the descendant community were ultimately not surprised when the plots were discovered last year. Older members of the church long spoke about their ancestors being buried at the church based on oral histories passed down generations.  Johnette Weaver, a Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendent community, said she recalls hearing stories from a church elder about their great grandfather being buried at the original church site.  “For Black people, a lot of our history is oral,” Weaver said. “It doesn’t mean that it’s untrue, it just means it wasn’t written anywhere or inscribed anywhere.”  To date, the Colonial Williamsburg archaeology team has identified a total of 41 burial shafts. Of these burials, only one is marked, by an upside down wine bottle at the foot of the grave. Gary speculates that this grave may have belonged to a church leader or someone of prominence in Williamsburg’s colonial community.  This marked grave will be the last of the three graves to be excavated and analyzed as part of the project. Anthony Pinn, a humanities professor at Rice University, said the discovery of the burials is significant given that under White supremacy in the Antebellum South, Black people were exploited and reduced to their physical bodies’ ability to provide labor. White supremacy also worked to deny Black people family connections and social ties under slavery, Pinn added.  “Burial within the context of the Black church was not simply a recognition of death, but it was a recognition of life, that this person was substantive, had impact on the world, and that they had to be recognized and celebrated for who they were in a much fuller sense,” Pinn said.  Gary said accurately telling the story of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches is at the heart of the project. Following the excavation of each burial, he said the next step is to conduct both DNA and osteological analysis on the skeletal remains to gain more insight into who was buried at the church. The DNA analysis, to be conducted by the University of Connecticut, is anticipated to uncover information about the three individuals’ skin tone, eye color and even their propensity for certain diseases. The analysis of the bones, to be performed at the College of William & Mary’s Institute for Historical Biology, is expected to show how old these individuals were when they died as well as their place of origin, sex, quality of life and more.  Members of the church’s descendant community eventually hope to submit their DNA to assess biological kinship to those buried at the church. At the conclusion of the project, the remains will be reinterred.  Gary said he expects this phase of the excavation project to take about a year, between the actual act of excavating the graves as well as analyzing and reinterring them. He said Colonial Williamsburg also hopes to reconstruct the church with historically accurate dimensions and furnishings to replicate how the church looked in the colonial era by 2026, the 250th anniversary of the church.  “We’re going to put it back exactly where it was,” Gary said. “It’ll be sitting in its exact footprint, as it was the day the congregation built it in the early 1800s.” Gary also said the input of the descendant community will be at the center of how Colonial Williamsburg proceeds with the project, including how to commemorate the site on a long-term basis and how they would like to see the remains reinterred.  Harshaw said she hopes the project signals the importance of telling complete and accurate histories that reflect a diverse set of experiences.  “We are really hoping that we will be an example for the nation,” Harshaw said. “If we can do it in the Commonwealth of Virginia, where you can drive up down I-95 on any given day and see Confederate flags, we are hoping that the rest of the nation will look to see what we’re doing and say ‘you know what, we probably need to do something about the fact that this place looked very different, or there’s a very different and more important and significant story,’ because the bottom line is this: We have a shared history.” ",Connie Harshaw;Anthony Pinn;Shondra Dandridge;Shondra Dandridge;Alvene Conyers;Jacquelyne Germain;Jack Gary,Freedom

277,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/business/nightcap-four-day-workweek/,"This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here. If there’s one thing the pandemic taught us all, it’s that work really stinks whether we’re doing it from the office or from home. (OK, that and the fact we have all lost our collective minds and we can politicize literally anything, including a global public health crisis.) Lousy jobs led millions of people to drop out of the workforce altogether, creating the seemingly perpetual labor shortage that has become the bane of hiring managers’ existence. During the Great Resignation, a record number of Americans have quit their jobs because of burnout, low pay, childcare, eldercare… you name it. To entice people back into the job market, employers have hiked pay. But inflation has wiped that away and then some, so that hasn’t worked. Bosses have let some of us work from home, but that’s a perk many offices have started to dial back on as people grow less Covid-fearful. So here’s a crazy solution: Let people work less. I know, it sounds radical. But it turns out workers are really into the idea, AND they’re more productive.  For the past eight weeks, thousands of people in the United Kingdom have tested a four-day schedule — with no cut to their pay, my colleague Anna Cooban reports. It’s the world’s biggest trial of a four-day work week so far. Unsurprisingly, some workers have said they feel happier, healthier and are doing better in their jobs. During similar trials between 2015 and 2019 in Iceland, there was no drop in productivity among four-day workers — and a dramatic increase in employee well-being. When Microsoft tried a shorter workweek in Japan in 2019, it found productivity went up by almost 40%. So who do we need to fight to get a three-day weekend around here? It turns out the answer may be inertia. In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted we would be working 15-hour weeks by 2030, with hours in the office winding down over time. But the 40-hour workweek was hard-fought by unions across America, and it just kind of … stuck. A 9-5, Monday-Friday shift became the norm, and over time it became hard for businesses and workers to think differently. You can present your boss all the data you want, but it’s unlikely you’re going to have much success convincing management that the way to increase productivity and solve the labor shortage is to give everyone Friday off, forever. MY TAKE: As a relatively low-down-the-totem-pole people manager, I understand both sides. Allison (as you know) is a fierce advocate for a four-day workweek, and if only I had the power, I’d make it happen for her. And with unending, constant meetings that could have been emails, combined with 3 pm zone-out time and catching up on “The Bachelor” with work buddies, I’m sure that accumulates into a full day over the course of my week where my productivity is effectively zero. I’d happily cut that out to spend more time with my family or whatever. But — and hear me out on this — what if we just started by making work better? I’m not only saying this because my bosses read this (hi bosses!), but work should be a fulfilling enterprise where we feel like we’re accomplishing something important and meaningful in our lives. Whether it’s saving the planet or cleaning toilets, work is necessary. And good companies should provide a positive environment for employees to grow and feel like they’re doing something worthwhile.  Instead, too often, companies put morons like me in charge, because they don’t know what else to do with people, so they make them managers. Anyway, this has been fun, but let’s get back to work, Allison! Those stories aren’t going to write themselves. NUMBER OF THE DAY: 53.6 million That’s the number of metric tons of electronic junk the world threw away in 2019, according to the most recent data from the United Nations. Only 17.4% of that was recycled, my colleague Catherine Thorbecke reports. SOME KIND OF MEOW MIX-UP Cat food is gross. It smells weird, it’s overly oily, and, let’s be honest, it looks like something that should come out — not go in. Yet, for some ungodly reason, Purina is opening up a cat-food-inspired restaurant for humans in New York this month.  The dishes at Gatto Bianco, Purina’s pop-up Italian-style trattoria, were supposedly inspired by Fancy Feast’s new “Medleys” cat food line. Medleys include options like “beef ragú with tomatoes & pasta in a savory sauce,” which, as my colleague Zoe Sottile noted, is designed for the cat with discerning taste. Just a note about fancy cat food for a minute: My cats would routinely drink from the toilet, lick their anuses in public and leave dead rodents on the bed, so, like, these aren’t exactly finishing school graduates. I’m all for keeping your cat healthy, but “beef & pork Milanese with potatoes & carrots in savory juices” seems like it’s going to get lost on the audience. I get what Purina’s trying to do here: It’s a meal so delicious, even you would eat it! But there’s a reason I feed my pets (relatively) inexpensive food out of a can: Because they’re animals, and I’ve seen them eat a literal dead squirrel carcass and act happier than with anything I’ve ever fed them.

90,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/weather/mckinney-wildfire-northern-california/,"A wildfire raging in Northern California was exacerbated by winds from thunderstorms this weekend, causing significant growth, officials said. The fire, known as the McKinney fire, has burned more than 51,000 acres as of Sunday afternoon, according to CAL FIRE. It is 0% contained. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for Siskiyou County, saying the blaze has threatened critical infrastructure and forced nearly 2,000 residents to flee their homes. The McKinney fire started on Friday in Siskiyou County near the California-Oregon border, about four hours north of Sacramento. The Klamath National Forest lists the cause of the fire as under investigation. Siskiyou county has a population of just about 44,000, according to the US Census Bureau. A mandatory evacuation order was announced for parts of Siskiyou County on Saturday, according to the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office. Residents within the evacuation zone are being asked to “please leave immediately.” About 60 people were evacuated from the Pacific Crest Trail on Saturday due to the McKinney Fire, the Jackson County Sheriff’s office in Oregon said on its verified Facebook page, noting the hikers were rescued from the “California side of the Red Buttes Wilderness.” The Pacific Crest Trail runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to Canada, according to the forest service. A red flag warning, which indicates dangerous fire conditions, is in effect in the area through Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service. “Abundant lightning” is expected through Monday, as well as scattered thunderstorms, which “could contribute to fire spread” but could also bring “locally significant wetting rainfall” in some areas, the weather service said. Firefighters were forced to shift their tactics “from an offensive perimeter control effort” to more of a defensive posture to assist with evacuations Saturday morning, an InciWeb report notes.  Two other fires burning in Siskiyou County – the China 2 and Evans fires – merged and together burned more than 300 acres, prompting evacuation warnings for more than 200 residents, according to the governor’s office. The state of emergency is meant to unlock state resources and allow firefighters from other states to help crews battling the fires in California, according to the governor’s office.

477,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/gun-violence-ohio-shooting-issa-jeylani/,"Editor’s Note: The United States is on pace to match or surpass its worst year on record for the number of gun violence related incidents, many of which don’t draw major headlines. Through this Portraits of American Gun Violence series, CNN is working to tell the stories of the victims of gun violence, names you may have never heard of but lives that have been forever changed. Ali Jeylani knows you shouldn’t pick favorites when it comes to family members, but of his seven siblings, he’s always had a soft spot for his younger brother, Issa. Maybe it’s their shared love of soccer, their admiration for Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo, or maybe it’s simply that the pair saw a piece of themselves in each other despite their seven-year age gap. Issa, 15, should be starting his sophomore year of high school in the fall, but, instead, his family is mourning his death after he was shot while playing soccer with friends in Columbus, Ohio, making him one of about 1,000 children and teen victims of gun violence so far this year.  On Friday, July 22, Issa was playing soccer with his teammates from the Hilltop Tiger Soccer Club, part of MY Project USA, a nonprofit focused on fighting against gang violence.   A group approached the boys looking for one of Issa’s teammates, according to Zerqa Abid, president of MY Project USA.   The teens argued on the field and someone pulled out a gun, and a shot hit Issa, Abid said. The shooting happened just before 10:30 p.m., according to police. It’s unclear how many shots were fired. “This is a community loss, this is not just a family loss,” Abid said. “Issa has taken a piece of our hearts with him and we are in mourning.” Gun violence has marred 2022, which may be the nation’s worst year ever, experts say. More than 26,000 gun violence deaths have been recorded so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  Ali Jeylani, 22, is also a coach with the Hilltop Tigers Soccer Club but was on a different part of the field when the shooting took place. He was getting ready to leave the chaos when he realized Issa wasn’t with him. By the time he found Issa, his younger brother had a gunshot wound and was bleeding profusely from his chest, Jeylani said.  Two other teens were hurt in the incident, Maureen Kocot with the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. One suffered a gunshot wound but is expected to make a full recovery and another suffered minor injuries in the chaos following the shooting. Authorities told CNN they aren’t prepared to speak on a possible motive and no suspects have been taken into custody. Abid suspects the attack was related to gang violence, the same thing her organization, MY project USA, works to protect against.  The organization aims “to protect and empower our youth and families” and “uplift underprivileged, crime-ridden neighborhoods” through community programs, like the Hilltop Tiger Soccer Club, according to its website.  “Right now, we’re trying to process everything, but we are having family talks and getting closer as a family,” Jeylani told CNN. “He didn’t deserve this; he really just wanted to play soccer.” Abid has known the Jeylani family for several years and became close with Issa because he volunteered with the nonprofit.   For as much as the nonprofit does to protect and empower the youth and the community from gangs and gun violence, Abid said losing Issa in this way is heartbreaking.  Leading by example on and off the field Issa, who would have turned 16 next month, had big plans. He wanted to go to college and continue to play soccer. Issa would often talk about his goals with his older brother during their chats at home, Jeylani said. Not only was Ali a brother to Issa, he was his confidante, his soccer coach and his mentor in one. “Everybody in the house I would get mad at for coming in my room, but when he comes in my room, I can’t get mad, I just let him stay and we would chill,” Jeylani said.  Issa may have been the smallest player on the soccer field but he played with the biggest heart, Ali Jeylani said.  Jeylani likes to think that Issa inherited his love for Real Madrid from him. He’s grateful they got to watch the team win their biggest trophy of the season together on TV in the Champions League. James Fredrickson coached four Jeylani brothers, including Ali and Issa, at the Ohio Premier Soccer Club in the suburbs of Columbus. Through relationships in the soccer club community, Hilltop Tigers connects players they think can play at a more advance level with clubs like Ohio Premier Soccer Club, which is how the Jeylani brothers were coached under Fredrickson’s wing. “We have some donors that sponsor these kids to come to practice,” he said, “and go to events that they normally would not have been able to go to.” One of his favorite memories of Issa’s character was off the field during a tournament in Indianapolis last year. After the evening’s game had wrapped up, Fredrickson and the four boys he was chaperoning went into a Red Robin for dinner when Issa saw a group of special needs diners leaving. As they shuffled out the door, Issa held the door open but noticed one woman was left behind.   Instead of focusing on getting his dinner, Issa approached the van that was backing out of the parking lot without one of its members and alerted them. “Had Issa not acted so quickly, that could have been really bad, who knows? Fredrickson said. “And we all talked about that night … how we looked at other places, and how we just kind of felt like, God had maybe put us there for that purpose that night.” As a soccer player, Fredrickson said, Issa was skilled and crafty with the ball. “We’re all devastated,” he said. “It’s so tragic.” The family has been raising money to ease the burden of funeral and memorial costs associated with burying Issa. Worrying for the safety of other youth “One debate the whole nation is going through is why these people or anybody who doesn’t need guns, has guns,” Abid said. “So that’s one question but on the top, MY Project USA has seen that when we do the right programming, we can keep our children away from gangs and guns and we have proven that.”  And now, Abid worries for the safety of the other youth in her programs and says the entire community needs to take a stance to prevent future violence. “Issa’s case really highlighted for me that doing it just for few might not be enough; we have to do it with a holistic approach for all of us.” After taking a few weeks off from coaching, Jeylani plans to return to coaching at the Hilltop Tiger Soccer Club in an effort to do his part to protect the youth in his community. He feels like that’s what Issa would have wanted. “I don’t want them (players) to feel like they’re not safe and just do the best I can to coach them, get their mind off stuff from home and make them want to do better and achieve their dreams.”  And even though Issa won’t be knocking on his brother’s bedroom door for their sibling chats, Jeylani knows his brother hasn’t gone far. “We still feel like he’s here. He’s in our hearts,” he said.

63,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/hurricane-season-saharan-dust-wxn/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.  We’ve now entered month three of hurricane season, which is more than 30% of the way through, and it seems like we are getting a slow start. People have even asked me where it was, or even commented they thought this season was supposed to be busy. So, I asked a hurricane expert. “You’re right! It sure has been quiet in the Atlantic lately,” said Phil Klotzbach, research scientist at Colorado State University, in an email to CNN. “We had a brief flurry in late June/early July with Bonnie and Colin, but it’s been dead since then.” And you may not even remember those two storms, especially Colin in early July. If you blinked, you missed it. Colin formed over land in South Carolina and only survived about 24 hours. But let’s not write hurricane season off just yet. If you have vacation plans during the next couple weeks, you should be in the clear – however, we should start to see things slowly (or quickly) change soon. “There are signs that things should pick up as we head towards mid-August,” Klotzbach noted. One reason we have had a quiet few weeks is thanks to dry air coming from Africa. “This dry air suppresses thunderstorm activity which is necessary for thunderstorm complexes moving off of Africa to thrive and grow into hurricanes,” Klotzbach explained. “Dry air is pretty common in the tropical Atlantic at this point during the season.” Many times, dry air outbreaks are associated with the Saharan dust you hear us talk about quite a bit this time of year. The dry air carries the dust across the Atlantic and can reach the US. It can cause respiratory problems in some but also provide glowing sunsets and sunrises. “Typically, by the time we get into mid-August, strong dust outbreaks (and associated dry air) tend to subside, and the tropical Atlantic becomes more conducive for hurricane formation,” Klotzbach added. Our sense of ‘normal’ has been shaken It’s also easy to lose sight of what is even considered normal now. Both 2020 and 2021 were extremely active seasons early on. 2020 had 30 named storms for the entire season and was already on the I-named storm (Isaias) at this point in the season, steamrolling right through the entire alphabet and a portion of the Greek alphabet too. Last year exhausted all the hurricane names for the second year in a row, which has never happened before and marked the sixth consecutive “above normal” hurricane season. So, it is not surprising we are starting to scratch our heads about why nothing much has happened during the last few weeks. But 2021 did have a bit of a break during this time period as well, where nothing formed between July 9 and August 11, which is very reminiscent of this year. Klotzbach also pointed out while El Niño and La Niña are big seasonal drivers of how the season should play out, there are other phenomena driving shorter-term variability. “The Madden-Julian oscillation can either increase or decrease Atlantic hurricane activity,” Klotzbach emphasized. “The MJO is deep thunderstorm activity that propagates around the globe every about 30-60 days. As it does so, it can alter levels of vertical wind shear and midlevel moisture.” It has been another contributing factor to the lack of activity during the last month, because the oscillation has prohibited thunderstorm development over Africa.  Thunderstorms in western Africa tend to push west into the Atlantic, becoming the building blocks of tropical development. The season isn’t dead  While it has been a nice break from hurricanes this month, Klotzbach is confident the tide will turn. “The models are generally forecasting a more conducive pattern for the Atlantic by the time that we get to the middle of August,” Klotzbach reported. “Air is forecast to more consistently rise over Africa and sink over the tropical Pacific. This pattern should result in reduced vertical wind shear.” It means we will see an environment ripe for hurricane development, right on cue. “The average first Atlantic hurricane forms on August 11 and historically, 90% of major hurricanes form after August 20,” Klotzbach stated. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Colorado State University are both putting out their updated hurricane forecasts for the season Thursday, so be sure to check back and see if the numbers go up, down or stay the same. Also, Vice President Kamala Harris is traveling to the National Hurricane Center in Miami today, where she will “receive a briefing on climate resilience as communities face climate risks including hurricanes, floods, drought, extreme heat, and wildfires,” according to the White House schedule.

674,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/tech/baidu-robotaxi-permits-china,"Tech giant Baidu announced Monday that it has obtained permits to operate fully autonomous taxis without any human assistants on board in two of China’s megacities, marking a first for the country. Baidu, which operates China’s largest search engine, said it received the regulatory approvals for its autonomous ride-hailing service Apollo Go to operate on open roads during the daytime in Chongqing and Wuhan. The cities have populations of some 30 million and 11 million people, respectively. The move represents a notable step forward for Baidu and a potential shift in China’s comfort with the new technology. In other cities where the company’s robotaxis operate, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Baidu is required to have a human safety operator present in the vehicle.  “We have finally come to the moment that the industry has been longing for,” Wei Dong, vice president and chief safety operation officer of Baidu’s Intelligent Driving Group, said in a statement Monday. “We believe these permits are a key milestone on the path to the inflection point when the industry can finally roll out fully autonomous driving services at scale.” The permits will allow Baidu to provide fully driverless robotaxi services in designated areas in Wuhan from 9 am to 5 pm and in Chongqing from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm local time. Service will be limited at first, however, with just five robotaxis operating in each city. In the United States, robotaxi offerings remain extremely sparse and ridehailing giants like Uber and Lyft have abandoned in-house self-driving taxi efforts. In June, General Motors-backed Cruise gained permits in California to charge a fare for driverless rides in San Francisco. In July, however, Reuters reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into a crash of a Cruise self-driving vehicle that resulted in minor injuries. Waymo One, the autonomous ride-hailing service operated by Google’s parent company Alphabet, currently offers fully autonomous rides in the Phoenix area.",,Google;Traffic Safety Administration;Baidu Intelligent Driving Group;Cnn;United States;United States;United States;Reuters,"TRAFFIC,1977;SOC_EMERGINGTECH,767;WB_168_ROADS_AND_HIGHWAYS,1969;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1969;WB_1809_HIGHWAYS,1969;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1969;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,128;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,919;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,1070;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANTS,139;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,110;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,1078;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,295;TAX_FNCACT_OPERATOR,935;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,13;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,76;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1193;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1345;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1821;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,76;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,1193;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,1345;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,1821;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,76;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,1193;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,1345;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,1821;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,76;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,1193;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,1345;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,1821;LEADER,1070;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1070;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1070;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,1984;WB_1429_ROAD_SAFETY,1984;WB_790_TRANSPORT_AND_SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT,1984;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1984;WB_784_TRAFFIC_AND_ROAD_SAFETY,1984;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1984;WB_1808_TRANSPORT_SAFETY,1984;WB_1428_INJURY,2091;WB_1406_DISEASES,2091;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,2091;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2091;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,2091;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1103;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1103;",San Francisco;Wuhan;Chongqing;United States;Beijing;Wei Dong;Shanghai;Shenzhen;California;Phoenix;China

468,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/california-mckinney-fire-saturday/,"California’s McKinney Fire has destroyed nearly 90 houses and is only 40% contained a week after breaking out in the Klamath National Forest, with hot and dry conditions expected to continue through the weekend. The blaze, the largest wildfire in California so far this year, erupted on July 29 in the forest near the California-Oregon border and grew rapidly, fueled by winds from thunderstorms.  As of Sunday morning, the fire had burned over 60,200 acres and the perimeter was 40% contained, according to InciWeb, a US clearinghouse for fire information. More than 3,500 fire personnel are involved in battling the fire.  Of 274 structures inspected so far, 87 homes and an additional 47 structures – including garages and commercial buildings – have been destroyed, according to an initial damage assessment released by the Siskiyou County Office of Emergency Services. The office said a further four structures had minor damage from the fire, with the damage assessment more than 50% complete. The Klamath River community remains under an evacuation order, it said. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam said weather conditions were unlikely to help quell the fire over the weekend. “Conditions have remained sunny and hot around the McKinney fire within the past 24 hours lending to the dry conditions near the incident. High temperatures have neared the triple digits in the valley floors, with excessive heat continuing through Monday before slightly cooler temperatures move in,” he said. “The combination of the heat, low humidity values, dry conditions and downslope winds mean that further spread of the fire can be anticipated through the weekend and into early next week. Although a thunderstorm cannot be ruled out over the fire region today, it won’t likely contain any meaningful rainfall.” The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office said it was working to try to allow residents back to their properties but that numerous hazards remained in the evacuation zone. Four bodies have been recovered from the burn area, it said earlier in the week. Search and Rescue teams from California and southern Oregon had contributed more than 1,000 volunteer hours to the operation, the sheriff’s office said in a post on Facebook. “At least 150 SAR members have been staffing our Law Enforcement Command Post, planning and organizing daily operations, going downriver to assist with searching structures and homes, and everything else that goes into a large incident. We have also had 10 search and rescue K9 teams, starting early in the morning each day,” it said.   Homes burned to the ground Among the homes that burned down was that of Kayla Dailey, who fled the blaze with her family on the due date for her third child. “I could see nothing but smoke and the fire coming down the mountain,” Dailey told CNN earlier this week. Dailey, her two young sons, husband Levi and the family’s roommate Dalton Shute left in their small car with few possessions. Dailey later learned the fire had started just 3 miles away from their home, which they had relocated to from Indiana just four months ago. When she spoke to CNN, Dailey was concerned that the evacuation of the nearest hospital meant she faced a 2-hour trek through the mountains to give birth at a hospital in Medford, Oregon. On Friday, she shared the news that the local hospital began accepting patients on a limited basis when Dailey went into labor and her baby daughter was born safely via emergency C-section on Thursday.Her brother-in-law has established a GoFundMe page to help the family, which lost everything in the fire. Shute, the Dailey’s friend and roommate, told CNN that he had lost his mother to a house fire when he was 6 years old.  “I feel that sort of emptiness I felt when I was a child,” he said. But he was optimistic that he and his friends would rebound. “We’re definitely not going to let this set us back,” Shute said. Valerie Linfoot and her husband, both retired forest firefighters, lost their home of more than three decades. “We’ve fought fires and seen homes burn up and been in a place of being the firefighters there doing that work, but to have it happen to yourself, it’s just unimaginable,” Linfoot told CNN earlier in the week. “I’m still overwhelmed that we’re the victims of this horrible, horrible convergence of weather and fire, which so many times we’ve seen other people suffer.” For Linfoot, the hardest part is thinking about the irreplaceable items that were left behind when her home burned down, such as her wedding rings, the ashes of her mother and grandmother and her children’s baby photographs. The Linfoots set up a GoFundMe page to help them with recovery and rebuilding. “It’s a small community and this is absolutely devastating to Klamath River,” she said. “I don’t know how they’re gonna recover. None of us are rich people. We’re all hardworking and resilient people, but most people that were down there are middle class, regular working folks or retirees.”",Valerie Linfoot;Dalton Shute;Kayla Dailey,Facebook;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,1325;MANMADE_DISASTER_HOUSE_FIRE,4225;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,4782;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,3031;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,4300;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,4026;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,4124;BORDER,347;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,1288;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,2284;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,3451;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,707;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,771;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,2155;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,2500;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,707;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,771;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2155;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2500;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,2427;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,3570;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,946;TAX_FNCACT_VOLUNTEER,2463;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1363;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,55;AFFECT,470;EVACUATION,470;DISASTER_FIRE,503;DISASTER_FIRE,696;DISASTER_FIRE,1159;DISASTER_FIRE,1400;DISASTER_FIRE,1930;DISASTER_FIRE,2048;DISASTER_FIRE,3073;DISASTER_FIRE,3289;DISASTER_FIRE,3932;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,1086;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,752;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,816;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,150;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,314;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1805;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,4488;WB_1777_FORESTS,150;WB_1777_FORESTS,314;WB_1777_FORESTS,1805;WB_1777_FORESTS,4488;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,150;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,314;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1805;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4488;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,150;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,314;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1805;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4488;WB_168_ROADS_AND_HIGHWAYS,1760;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1760;WB_1809_HIGHWAYS,1760;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1760;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,255;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,255;KILL,2299;CRISISLEX_C05_NEED_OF_SHELTERS,2884;GENERAL_HEALTH,3475;GENERAL_HEALTH,3550;GENERAL_HEALTH,3681;MEDICAL,3475;MEDICAL,3550;MEDICAL,3681;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,3475;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,3550;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,3681;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,3475;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,3550;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,3681;MEDIA_MSM,3657;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2534;WB_1979_NATURAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT,3098;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,3098;WB_1986_MOUNTAINS,3098;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,4782;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,4782;SECURITY_SERVICES,2601;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2601;WB_840_JUSTICE,2601;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2601;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,2601;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,2601;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,2601;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,43;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,966;ECON_MIDDLECLASS,5455;WB_695_POVERTY,5455;WB_1153_MIDDLE_CLASS,5455;WB_1152_ECONOMIC_AND_SOCIAL_MOBILITY,5455;WB_707_POVERTY_MEASUREMENT_AND_ANALYSIS,5455;LEGISLATION,2589;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2589;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,5098;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,3764;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,5103;",Indiana;Siskiyou County;Oregon;Klamath;California
31,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/peter-navarro-documents/,"The Justice Department sued former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday, seeking to force Navarro to turn over emails from a private account that he used while working at the Trump White House.   According to the lawsuit, the National Archives learned of Navarro’s private account from the House committee investigating the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, which obtained messages from the previously unknown email address.  Between 200 and 250 of the emails on Navarro’s private account should have been given to the National Archives, prosecutors say.  Navarro, however, did not copy these messages to his official government email account, according to prosecutors, and when the archivist attempted to contact Navarro in order to secure these records, Navarro did not respond.  The lawsuit is a bold and unusual enforcement move by the Justice Department’s Federal Programs Branch – which pursues civil, not criminal, matters – to strike at alleged sloppy federal records maintenance during the Trump administration.   Public records advocates have long taken issue with lost, never-created or deleted records, but the Justice Department has rarely sued former administration officials over the Presidential Records Act.   “Mr. Navarro has refused to return any Presidential records that he retained absent a grant of immunity for the act of returning such documents,” the lawsuit says, adding that Navarro “is wrongfully retaining Presidential records that are the property of the United States, and which constitute part of the permanent historical record of the prior administration.”       The lawsuit says that Justice Department officials attempted to negotiate with Navarro and his legal team to get a copy of the emails, but Navarro refused unless he was given “a grant of immunity” in exchange. It is not clear what Navarro wanted immunity from.   The former trade adviser is facing separate contempt of Congress charges after failing to comply with a subpoena by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021. In July, Navarro rejected a plea offer, claiming that former President Donald Trump told him he was covered by executive privilege.   Navarro’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Donald Trump;Steve Bannon;Steve Bannon;Peter Navarro;Peter Navarro;Peter Navarro,White House;White House;White House;White House;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Cnn;Justice Department Federal Programs Branch;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;National Archives;National Archives,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,382;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,835;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,382;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,835;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,16;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1054;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1343;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2061;WB_840_JUSTICE,16;WB_840_JUSTICE,1054;WB_840_JUSTICE,1343;WB_840_JUSTICE,2061;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,2572;GENERAL_HEALTH,419;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,419;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,419;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,419;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,419;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,419;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,419;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,419;TRIAL,32;TRIAL,1370;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,1909;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,2024;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,2354;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,410;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,80;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,1853;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,1968;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,2314;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2602;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,353;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,551;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,621;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2432;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,1124;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1034;WB_698_TRADE,72;WB_698_TRADE,1845;WB_698_TRADE,1960;WB_698_TRADE,2306;TAX_FNCACT_ARCHIVIST,899;LEADER,2522;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2522;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,51;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,226;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1824;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1939;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1402;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2082;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,824;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,753;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,876;",White House;United States
220,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/navajo-nation-code-talker-dies/,"Samuel Sandoval, one of the last surviving Navajo Code Talkers who served during World War II, died Friday, according to a release from the Navajo Nation. During the war, Sandoval was one of hundreds of young Navajo men recruited to use an 813-word code based on the native Navajo language to send and receive military communications in the South Pacific Theater.  “Navajo Code Talker Samuel Sandoval will always be remembered as a loving and courageous person who sacrificed more than we will ever know to defend our homelands using our sacred Navajo language,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a statement. “We are saddened by his passing, but his legacy will always live on in our hearts and minds. On behalf of the Navajo Nation, we offer our prayers and heartfelt condolences to his wife, Malula Sandoval, his children, and many loved ones.”  Sandoval was born in 1922 in Nageezi, New Mexico, and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1943, the Navajo Nation release said. He completed basic training at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in California, where the 29 original Code Talkers had arrived in 1942. The original Navajo recruits were tasked with developing an unbreakable code by using words from their language and encoding it with word substitution to transmit tactical information over telephone and radio. The Navajo language was chosen as a code because it was not written and very few people who aren’t of Navajo origin could speak it, according to the CIA. The Code Talkers were used in every major operation involving the Marines in the Pacific theater, and are credited with helping the US take Iwo Jima. Sandoval served in five combat tours, including Guadalcanal, Bougainville, Guam, Peleliu, and Okinawa, before he was honorably discharged on January 26, 1946, according to the Navajo Nation release.  He and other Navajo Code Talkers could not talk about the code for more than two decades, until the operation was declassified in 1968.  In 1982, then-President Ronald Reagan gave the Code Talkers a Certificate of Recognition and declared August 14 Navajo Code Talkers Day. Sandoval earned multiple awards for his service, including a Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, a Combat Action Ribbon, a China Service Medal, a World War II Victory Medal, a Navy Occupation Service Medal with Asia Clasp and an Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with a silver star, in lieu of five bronze stars, the release said.  Earlier this year, Sandoval also received the 2022 American Spirit Award for Bravery by the National WWII Museum. Following his service with the Marine Corps, Sandoval earned a certificate in substance abuse counseling, and worked in Farmington, New Mexico as a counselor, the release said.

574,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-search-explainer/,"The FBI search of former President Donald Trump’s residence in Florida on Monday signaled an extraordinary escalation of an investigation into the handling of certain documents from his presidency and raises questions about whether his legal exposure extends beyond whether he improperly took government records when he left the White House.  What exactly the FBI was searching for and why is still unknown. But to obtain a search warrant, investigators would have had to show a judge that there was probable cause of a crime and that evidence of that crime was located at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Palm Beach resort. Here’s what to know about the legal significance of the search, which comes as Trump is preparing a potential 2024 presidential run, and what could come next:  What would it have taken for the DOJ to have obtained the search warrant?  To get judicial approval for the search, investigators would have had to present to a judge a detailed affidavit that would establish that probable cause exists to believe that a crime had been committed and that that evidence of that crime exists in recent days at the property where the search is being sought.   The search warrant would have been filed under seal, meaning that its details are not publicly available at the moment (though they could become public in the future). The federal courthouse in West Palm Beach lists only one sealed search warrant application since June that was still not closed as of Friday, according to the court’s public register of cases.  But before prosecutors got to the point of asking a magistrate judge to approve the warrant, in order to move forward with a search that carried such historical and political significance, investigators would have had to obtain the OK from the highest levels of the Justice Department, legal experts told CNN.  Former DOJ officials told CNN that it was likely that, at the very least, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco would have had to have given the green light and that Attorney General Merrick Garland and/or FBI Director Chris Wray may have also been consulted.   “Not only would the investigators have to suggest it, not only would a line prosecutor have to agree with it, but multiple layers of management would have had to approved of it – all the way up to the Attorney General,” Daren Firestone, a former DOJ attorney, told CNN.  The Justice Department has declined to comment. What does this mean for Trump’s legal exposure?  To take the extraordinary step of executing a search warrant on a former president’s home suggests investigators are looking at more than what the National Archives had previously recovered from Mar-a-Lago, according to legal experts.  In January, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago, including materials that had been identified as classified, but activity around those boxes have been quiet since the spring.  “I really don’t believe that the department would have taken such a significant step as pursuing a search warrant for the president’s residence about information they already had back,” Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director and CNN contributor, said on CNN “Newsroom.” “There had to be a suspicion, a concern and indeed specific information that led them to believe that there were additional materials that were not turned over.”  Before the news of Monday’s search, a law known as the Presidential Records Act had been forefront of public speculation about Trump’s legal jeopardy as other investigatory steps were taken related to the handling of documents from Trump’s White House. That law – passed after Watergate to make clear that certain records from a presidency belong to the public and not the former office holder – is not a criminal statute and has been seen as relatively toothless law.  A search warrant and the presence of the FBI signifies a criminal investigation. There are other record retention statutes that bring with them criminal penalties – such as the Espionage Act – but at this point it’s not clear what criminal statutes have been implicated in the Justice Department investigation.  It is a crime to destroy or remove federal records, or to mishandle classified documents. There are other federal laws that aim prevent the tampering of information during an investigation.  Earlier this year, the Justice Department issued subpoenas for presidential materials including classified documents that the National Archives had previously retrieved. The FBI also interviewed Trump aides at Mar-a-Lago in the spring as part of the probe, according to a source familiar with the matter.  For investigators to escalate their probe with a search, “there would have to be something serious enough that would merit more than a slap on the wrist,” Firestone, now a partner at the DC-based firm Levy Firestone Muse, said.  It’s also notable that the DOJ hasn’t gone the route of civil litigation against the former president for how he handled the documents in question. Just last week, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against former Trump White House official Peter Navarro, alleging that Navarro had violated the Presidential Records Act and seeking a court order compelling him to turn over emails from a private account that he used while working at the Trump White House.  Why now?  The search was executed two months after the previously unreported June 3 meeting between DOJ investigators and Trump’s attorneys at the resort. During the visit, reported by CNN on Monday, four investigators, including the chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, toured a basement where boxes of materials were being stored. Five days later, investigators sent Trump’s attorneys a letter asking them to further secure the room storing the documents, prompting aides to add a padlock to the room.  For the FBI to execute a search warrant two months later hints that the federal officials were not satisfied with what they saw on the visit or that they were not confident in the voluntary cooperation they were receiving from Trump’s team, some legal experts said. It’s possible federal officials also needed official sign off to repossess classified records.  “The fact that the FBI learned Trump still had documents at [Mar a Lago] in June, and felt the need to come back two months later with a search warrant, indicates to me that the agency has evidence that Trump and his staff were holding onto additional classified records and not taking any steps to properly return them to the Archives,” Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer, told CNN in an email.   It also may have taken months for the Justice Department to decide to do search and how it should go about it.  When the FBI was leaving Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s team would have received a document akin to a receipt of what was taken. But DOJ can be as vague as it wants in that documentation.  More broadly, the Justice Department can keep large swaths of its investigation secret, as the Justice Department made clear in court filings Monday evening around its search of John Eastman, the former Trump lawyer who spearheaded plots to subvert the 2020 election.  In that filing – where the Justice Department was arguing against an Eastman request that January 6 investigators return devices seized from him in late June in New Mexico – prosecutors said there was no obligation for the Department to share with Eastman more details about the status of its probe.  “The Government has no doubt that the movant would like to have full knowledge of the Government’s investigation and the ability to ‘engage [federal agents] in a debate over the basis of the warrant,” the filing said. “But the law only, and properly, requires a neutral magistrate judge to find probable cause to search for and seize any electronic devices on his person; it does not require that the person searched know the basis for the warrant.”  What happens next?  It still not known how off guard Trump’s lawyers were with the FBI actions taken Monday and what Trump’s team has been arguing to the DOJ about the handling of the documents in previous interactions with investigators.  Trump could take a pre-emptive legal step to challenge in court the way the FBI handled the search, perhaps with the goal of getting thrown out any evidence investigators had obtained or at least to try to get more information about what investigators in probing.  But without such court activity, the next steps of the investigation could very well continue in secret.  Can Trump be barred from running for president if he is found to have violated records law? Another law that may be implicated by the FBI’s search is one barring the willful concealment, removal or mutilation of government records. That law threatens as a punishment disqualification “from holding any office under the United States.”  However, there are questions about the constitutionality of that law and its applicability to a Trump presidential run, if he were to be convicted under it.  Because the Constitution sets specific qualifications for presidential office – and lays out a separate impeachment process for disqualifying presidents from holding office in the future – some argue that Congress would not have the authority to enact such a statute that would apply to a presidential candidate.

77,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/trump-justice-department-probe-subpoenas/,"“This is probably bad … for former President Trump.” With dry understatement, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the insurrection, summed up on CNN on Wednesday a significant turn in the Department of Justice probe into the mob attack on the US Capitol and the effort to overturn the 2020 election. News of grand jury subpoenas for former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin, the latter of which was first reported by CNN, is the latest sign that department investigators are reaching inside Trump’s inner circle during his final days in the White House. These developments, which are the clearest indication yet that Trump is in the investigation’s sights, suggest the effort to find the truth will survive even if Republicans win the House this fall and shut down the select committee. Unlike the House investigation, the Justice Department would be able to bring criminal charges against former Trump administration officials if it chooses. It follows that the department is seeking to litigate executive privilege claims that Trump is likely to make in an effort to thwart the investigation. This also suggests that the department, after months of complaints from House select committee members and others that it was not acting quickly enough, is moving with alacrity. Evidence of an expanding Justice Department investigation came amid new signs of the political power of Trump’s false claims of election fraud. Candidates touting his falsehoods won Republican primaries in Arizona and Michigan on Tuesday, and could be in a position to influence future elections if they beat Democratic rivals in November.  And the probe is also unfolding amid a widening controversy over texts missing from government phones used by the Defense Department and the US Secret Service during the period around January 6, 2021. CNN reported on Wednesday, for example, that the Secret Service may temporarily disable text messaging on employee cell phones as the agency scrambles to respond to concerns it may have erased messages. The disappearance of messages could be coincidental, but given the explosive post-election events, it’s raised suspicion. Both Cipollone and Philbin were subpoenaed, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. They were both close to Trump inside the White House in the fraught days after the 2020 election and in the run-up to the Capitol insurrection. The department sought their testimony after the grand jury also heard from two key members of former Vice President Mike Pence’s brain trust, his former chief of staff Marc Short and legal counsel Greg Jacob. Cipollone has also been a key figure in the House committee’s televised hearings, which have used him to highlight the potential illegality of Trump’s actions and refusal to intervene to quash the Capitol riot. The committee’s star witness, Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified that Cipollone warned staff could be charged with countless crimes if they let Trump go to the Capitol on January 6. In his own deposition before the committee, Cipollone declined to divulge details of his personal conversations with the then-President on privilege grounds. But with its longer timeline and resources, the Justice Department may have more power to overcome this obstacle, either in negotiations with Cipollone or through the courts. Trump may be the focus of investigators  Until it emerged that Cipollone and Philbin and the two key Pence aides were sought for grand jury testimony, it was not possible to establish whether the department was looking directly at the ex-President’s role in disrupting the peaceful transfer of power. But given the proximity of the two White House counsels, in particular, to the then-President, the line of inquiry now appears much clearer.  “You don’t call in the White House counsel, the deputy White House counsel, particularly in the wake of the testimony that they gave to the 1/6 committee, unless you are looking squarely and directly at Donald Trump,” Preet Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “The Lead” on Wednesday. Cipollone and Philbin could give investigators insight into Trump’s statements, actions and state of mind on one of the most perilous days in American history. That could be important to establishing whether he had corrupt intent to break the law. Cipollone’s testimony might also be threatening to Trump if executive privilege constraints are lifted since he has a reputation for integrity and telling the truth.  Among other revelations, Cipollone told the House select committee in closed-door videotaped testimony that he thought Trump should have conceded the election and that Pence deserved the Presidential Medal of Freedom for not aiding the effort to overturn the election in Congress.   A legal battle is brewing  Any appearance by Cipollone would, however, probably have to await a court battle on executive privilege, which allows a president to get private advice on key issues and cases and expect that it will be protected from inquiries from Congress under the doctrine of separation of powers.  CNN’s Pamela Brown reported on Tuesday that Cipollone and his attorneys were in discussions with Justice Department officials about a grand jury appearance and how to deal with executive privilege issues. Trump has repeatedly made vast claims of executive privilege that stretch to advisers and communications far beyond conventional understandings of its scope – and he’s likely to do so again.  Potentially, a court fight over Cipollone testimony could go all the way up to the Supreme Court. During the Watergate scandal, then-President Richard Nixon asserted executive privilege to try to prevent the handover of incriminating audio tapes. But in a ruling that could be significant in Trump’s case, the Supreme Court said that executive privilege could not be used to thwart the administration of criminal justice. In addition, the courts do not have a long track record of rulings on how far a former President can go with executive privilege, so any legal contest between Trump and the Department of Justice could cover significant new ground. The House January 6 committee did not litigate the question of Cipollone’s reluctance to talk about certain conversations with Trump. It is racing against a ticking clock since it is likely to be disbanded by pro-Trump Republicans in the House if control of the chamber changes after the midterm elections in November. But the Justice Department has the luxury of more time to conduct a legal fight.  “I am optimistic that the Department of Justice can win this,” former federal prosecutor Shan Wu said on CNN’s “The Situation Room” Wednesday, cautioning, however, that it could take months for a legal process to be resolved. That means a Justice Department investigation could go on well into next year at least. So even if the congressional probe expires, there will be at least one venue in which Trump could face accountability. This possibility of a prolonged investigation is one reason many observers believe Trump is leaning toward an early announcement of a 2024 presidential campaign. This would make it easier for the former President to argue that the investigation is a politicized attempt by the Biden administration to weaponize the Justice Department to try to keep him from reclaiming the White House. Garland’s dilemma  Still, evidence of investigation does not mean proof of guilt. While the revelations of the televised House hearings have been shocking, and demonstrated a higher involvement by the ex-President in the January 6 coup attempt than was previously known, Attorney General Merrick Garland would still face a profound dilemma in deciding whether to prosecute the ex-President.  The House committee’s hearings have painted a damning picture, but they have also cherry picked from depositions and available evidence and did not include cross-examinations that could pick holes in witness testimony.  A criminal case requires a higher bar of proof than a congressional inquiry. The gravity of prosecuting a former President suggests that Garland would have to be especially convinced of getting a conviction. A criminal case against Trump would also raise the question of whether such a process, which could rock the United States to its core and set precedents for future former Presidents, is truly in the national interest, however damning the evidence.  Conversely, establishing a principle that a President could evade legal accountability for trying to overturn an election could be equally ruinous to America’s democratic system and freedoms. In one sense, the January 6 committee and its success in getting deep inside the ex-President’s West Wing and exposing the plot to steal the election may be easing Garland’s decision making process. While Trump is sure to claim he’s a political victim if charged, the mountain of evidence – including horrifying testimony and graphic video of his mob attacking the Capitol – is serving to prepare the public and shape its perceptions of what really really happened. This may marginally defuse accusations that any prosecution of the ex-President is a purely political exercise. Even so, every day that signs point closer to a possible indictment of Trump – or a controversial decision not to pursue him – is one step closer to what would inevitably be a period of extraordinary national trauma.

571,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/trump-2024-bid/,"Top Republicans who have spent months trying to dissuade Donald Trump from announcing another presidential campaign before the midterms are coming around to the idea, after an unprecedented search of the former President’s Mar-a-Lago property by federal investigators on Monday lit up the GOP base.  Trump has received a fresh wave of encouragement to jump start his next presidential campaign in the 24 hours since his primary residence became the target of an FBI search warrant, several sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The former President, who is widely expected to run again, had previously eyed Labor Day as his target launch date, but is now being advised to accelerate his timeline to capitalize on what Republicans have described as extraordinary overreach and political persecution by Justice Department officials, including by advisers who previously counseled him to take his time with a 2024 announcement.  “My advice that we should wait until after the midterms was based upon a rather standard landscape. [The Justice Department] set off a nuclear bomb on that landscape yesterday. This is no longer a business-as-usual campaign. Not even close,” said Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump confidant, who previously urged the former President to wait for the 2022 election outcome before diving into a presidential primary.  One senior House Republican personally encouraged Trump on Tuesday to launch a bid before November, a source familiar tells CNN, dismissing concerns among fellow GOP lawmakers that a pre-midterm announcement could galvanize Democratic voters in a political environment that is otherwise considered favorable for Republicans.  Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s Capitol Hill allies, told reporters he spoke to the former President twice on Tuesday and “the one thing I can tell you is that I believed he was gonna run before [and] I am stronger in my belief now.” “I think President Trump is determined now more than ever to straighten this country out,” Graham added. The thinking inside Trump’s orbit and among some of his top allies on Capitol Hill has undergone a notable shift since the search was executed at his waterfront estate, said three well-placed sources. Advisers who initially worried Trump would steal the spotlight from vulnerable Democrats if he announced before November have largely abandoned those concerns, while those who fear the FBI search was prompted by compelling evidence against Trump – and he thus shouldn’t rush into another presidential campaign – become a minority in his orbit. The former President, who previously told aides he was concerned about not being able to tap into the $121 million war chest he’s amassed once he declares his candidacy, is now shrugging off those concerns in the last 12 hours, according to a person close to him. “Where others see criminal jeopardy, Donald Trump sees dollar signs,” said one person close to the former President.   “Most of the downsides of announcing early are regulatory or financial but the Democrats just guaranteed that Trump will raise three times the money he was going to and probably in the immediate future,” Caputo added.  A second person close to Trump said the episode has injected unity into the GOP, whose leaders were welcoming a contested presidential primary just weeks ago amid frustrations with Trump. This person said they had not seen Republicans “this unified behind something in a long time,” pointing to comments by two of Trump’s potential 2024 rivals – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence – condemning the FBI search.  “When do you see DeSantis and Pence on the same page defending Trump?” said one of the people close to Trump. ‘On the phone since daybreak’ After revealing the FBI had conducted a “raid” of his Palm Beach residence in a statement Monday evening, Trump became inundated with calls from allies wanting him to dive into the 2024 race sooner rather than later, according to a person familiar with the matter. He spent most of Tuesday hopping “from one phone call to the next,” this person said, adding that the former President “has been on the phone since daybreak.”  Those conversations were expected to continue well into Tuesday evening, with Trump huddling with Republican Study Committee members for a private dinner at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. RSC Chairman Jim Banks of Indiana wrote in a tweet hours before the event that Republicans “have a moral duty to fight back” following the search of Trump’s home.  According to Banks, Trump used the Bedminster meeting to inform the group of 12 Republicans that he’s “made up his mind” about launching a 2024 presidential bid, it’s just a matter of “when” he announces it.  The group encouraged Trump to run “sooner than later,” Banks said, who described Trump as being “upbeat,” “fired up,” and “not fazed at all” by the FBI search on his Florida property.  “My sense is he is fired up and ready to go. And he received a lot of encouragement in the room to get out sooner than later,” Banks said. Meanwhile, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have already initiated discussions about the party’s oversight response to the FBI search, according to GOP sources familiar with the situation, though these talks remain in the early stages. During a House GOP conference call on Tuesday morning, which had been previously scheduled, top Republicans – including Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Turner of Ohio – made clear they intend to seek a full accounting from the DOJ about the FBI’s actions, according to sources on the call. One of the more immediate steps likely to be taken is sending preservation letters to top DOJ officials – likely including Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy hinted at the party’s investigative plans Monday evening, tweeting: “Attorney General Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar.” There’s also the possibility that Republicans create a select committee to investigate the agency if the GOP retakes the lower chamber in November. However, a source familiar with his thinking said McCarthy is more inclined to let existing committees take the lead, and the decision is not one House GOP leaders would need to make for several more months.  Across Trump world, Republicans’ widespread condemnation of the FBI search appeared to dismantle a divide among his advisers over the timing of his 2024 campaign launch that had long been simmering beneath the surface. While many of Trump’s political advisers have warned him to wait until after the midterms to announce his plans, fearing it would harm some GOP candidates on the ballot in November to launch a campaign early this fall, others believe an early announcement could help the former President sell the argument that a federal investigation into Trump – or even a potential indictment – is strictly motivated by politics.  “There are some people making arguments that an indictment is an endorsement” for Trump, said Caputo, suggesting that Trump wouldn’t “present himself as a victim but as the leader of the victims” if he ran in 2024, harkening back to Trump’s use of Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” gaffe as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 to cultivate an anti-elitist bond with his base.  It’s a message Trump has already leaned into. During a rally in Arizona last month, Trump told the audience, “If I renounced my beliefs and… agreed to stay silent, and if I stayed home and took it easy… the persecution of Donald Trump would immediately stop. They would go onto the next victim.”  “But that’s not what I do. I can’t do that,” Trump said.  Still, while many of Trump’s allies are publicly slamming the unprecedented FBI activity at his home, some of the former President’s most loyal supporters are concerned that the search could have only happened because it was provoked by real evidence – noting that federal investigators would be unlikely to take such a drastic step without something tangible to back up their actions.  “They better have the goods or they just went a long way in resurrecting [Trump],” said one former Trump adviser.  A longtime Republican operative who disagreed with that sentiment said the search warrant that was executed at Mar-a-Lago might prove to be politically detrimental for Trump if it becomes “just another reason to pick someone else” for Republican voters in a presidential primary.  “Trump may eventually become too heavy a lift for voters. Now we have better, less draining options,” this person said.  Meanwhile, one top Republican continued to urge Trump on Tuesday to pump the brakes on a presidential announcement until after the midterms, despite the growing outrage over the FBI search among grassroots activists and other potential 2024 candidates.  “You don’t talk about the Super Bowl until you win the playoffs,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News Tuesday morning.  Republican response Nearly all of Trump’s potential rivals for the GOP nomination in 2024 have spoken up – a reflection of how the former President remains the central figure around which others in the Republican Party revolve. Since the news of the search broke, possible White House hopefuls have expressed everything from measured skepticism of the Justice Department’s actions to full-blown accusations of a political witch hunt against Trump. Several have adopted the language of Trump’s allies, accusing the Biden administration of “weaponizing” the Justice Department and targeting a political rival. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich condemned the raid as “brazen” and “completely unnecessary” in a statement.  “These disgusting actions by Joe Biden’s administration would make a third-world dictator blush. However, in the Democrats’ desperate attempt to retain power, they have unified and grown the entire conservative movement,” Budowich said. DeSantis – widely considered Trump’s chief competition in 2024 – responded quickly on Twitter Monday night, calling the search a “raid” and “another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves.” Others who may run for president in 2024 echoed those sentiments with similarly strident language and proposals.  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on Twitter that the Justice Department had been “weaponized” and called the search “corrupt & an abuse of power.” Also referring to a “weaponization” of the department was Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who vowed “consequences” against Garland for the search. And Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said the event was an “unprecedented assault on democratic norms and the rule of law,” calling on Garland to resign or be impeached, FBI Director Christopher Wray to be “removed” and for the FBI to be “reformed top to bottom.” Others have responded less bombastically but with carefully worded outrage about the FBI’s search. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called it a “stunning move” and suggested it was a “selective, politically motivated” search. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tempered his criticism by saying it demonstrated “apparent political weaponization” of federal law enforcement. Still other Republicans are framing their response even more guardedly, expressing a desire for the Justice Department to answer questions about the search warrant. On Twitter, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley called on the Justice Department and the FBI to comment, saying, “If they won’t comment, then Biden owes it to the American people to answer for his agencies.” Pence, who has spent months trying to find an independent political identity from Trump, tweeted a lengthy response to the search. Pence said he has “deep concern” about what he called an “unprecedented search” of Trump’s home and said the event “undermines public confidence” in the justice system. “Attorney General Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately,” Pence concluded. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who has been talked about as a potential anti-Trump Republican contender in 2024, said the FBI search will “undermine faith in democracy and the rule of law” if the Justice Department “cannot ultimately provide overwhelming evidence that action was absolutely necessary.” The Republicans’ collective defensive posture appears to reflect how the party’s leaders remain distrustful of federal law enforcement by default – a development borne out of Trump’s own attacks on the FBI ever since its investigation into his 2016 campaign. During an appearance on CBS Tuesday morning to promote his new book, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said there have long been concerns among Republicans about whether the FBI is “doing their job apolitical[ly].” He also said the search will “raise more questions” and urged people to “let this play out and see what happens.”  And when pressed about whether Trump remains the best representative of the GOP, Scott provided a clue about why even those who may run against him in the 2024 primary may feel compelled to accept Trump’s narrative about the search. “Certainly he is the largest voice in American politics, period,” said Scott. “The more focus you put on him, the more likely his supporters will rally around him.” This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

55,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/economy/medical-care-inflation/,"There are medicines that Angelina Scott can’t live without. Between her Atrial Fibrillation, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the 45-year-old notary is currently taking five prescriptions. “You can’t tell your heart, please don’t stop beating,” Scott told CNN. But with sky high inflation and hundreds of dollars in monthly medical bills, Scott and her husband, a maintenance worker, are falling behind financially. To cut costs, she’s stopped taking medicine for her irritable bowel syndrome, which she says cost several hundred dollars each month because insurance won’t cover it. “People will [say], you can’t afford not to. No, literally I cannot afford to,” Scott said, adding that forgoing the medicine “makes me fatigued, lethargic, I get the shakes, very sickly.” As high inflation takes a toll on household finances, millions of Americans are facing the same brutal decisions.  In June, US healthcare costs were up 4.5% from the year before, lagging overall inflation, which jumped 9.1% over the same 12-month period. But with the price of food, gas, rent and utilities surging at a far higher pace, many Americans are struggling to afford things like medical care. “What this leads people to do is have to make horrible tradeoffs between paying for their medication or their diagnostic test or seeing their physician or their doctor and having to pay for basic cost of living – their gas, their food, their groceries, their childcare,” said Patient Advocate Foundation CEO Alan Balch. A new survey from Gallup and West Health found nearly two in five adults – an estimated 98 million Americans – have delayed or skipped treatment, cut back on driving, utilities and food, or borrowed money, just to pay medical bills in the last six months. Roughly one in four adults are skipping care or medicine due to rising costs, the survey found. And 39% have major concerns about affording care in the coming months. “Inflation and its impact on health care are breaking families and breaking individuals and we need to wake up and act,” said West Health President Tim Lash. Libby Dancy, 71, is a case manager for an organization that helps struggling seniors in rural Virginia. But she herself can’t afford to retire. “I’ll be working here probably until they find me laid out back there in my office,” Dancy said. A three-time cancer survivor, she spends hundreds of dollars each month on critical medicine like heart pills, breathing treatments and insulin. So she’s tightening her budget: keeping her air conditioning off in the summer heat, and forgoing her allergy medication, probiotics, and vitamins until payday. “It [has] messed me up, messed my system up and everything,” Dancy said. “With the allergy medicine not taken, I sneeze a lot, my eyes water a lot and itch a lot. I get queasy, and then my asthma kicks in. And then I have to go to the breathing treatments, which are expensive.” High healthcare costs have long been a financial burden for millions of Americans, rising faster than inflation in recent decades. But now, surging costs for other everyday necessities are adding to the strain. Rising inflation has sent US household debt to a record high, more than $16 trillion during the second quarter. For some, the budget balancing act grows more difficult by the day. “I feel like it’s suffocating me slowly,” said Scott. “Why do I have to choose between living and living?”",Libby Dancy;Alan Balch;Angelina Scott,Patient Advocate Foundation;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_DISEASE_ASTHMA,2968;TAX_CHRONICDISEASE_ASTHMA,2968;RURAL,2268;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2561;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2523;ECON_INFLATION,297;ECON_INFLATION,777;ECON_INFLATION,908;ECON_INFLATION,987;ECON_INFLATION,1123;ECON_INFLATION,2031;ECON_INFLATION,3159;ECON_INFLATION,3276;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,297;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,777;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,908;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,987;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1123;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2031;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,3159;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,3276;WB_442_INFLATION,297;WB_442_INFLATION,777;WB_442_INFLATION,908;WB_442_INFLATION,987;WB_442_INFLATION,1123;WB_442_INFLATION,2031;WB_442_INFLATION,3159;WB_442_INFLATION,3276;TAX_FNCACT_PATIENT_ADVOCATE,1600;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,832;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1259;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1722;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,3128;TAX_DISEASE_ALLERGY,2729;TAX_DISEASE_ALLERGY,2864;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTOR,1476;TAX_ECON_PRICE,420;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1062;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1931;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3072;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3200;WB_2661_HIGH_CHOLESTEROL,136;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,371;TAX_DISEASE_IRRITABLE_BOWEL_SYNDROME,483;TAX_FNCACT_NOTARY,160;TAX_FNCACT_PHYSICIAN,1461;DELAY,1735;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1735;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,1735;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,2059;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,2455;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,2496;LEADER,2160;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2160;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2160;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2704;TAX_DISEASE_SYNDROME,483;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,2209;GENERAL_HEALTH,320;GENERAL_HEALTH,1304;GENERAL_HEALTH,1837;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,320;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1304;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1837;MEDICAL,24;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,24;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,24;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,24;WB_1973_FINANCIAL_RISK_REDUCTION,544;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,544;WB_337_INSURANCE,544;WB_1967_AGRICULTURAL_RISK_AND_SECURITY,544;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,2514;WB_1431_CANCER,2514;ECON_DEBT,3303;WB_450_DEBT,3303;ECON_COST_OF_LIVING,1517;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2668;WB_644_NUTRITION,2766;WB_1441_SUPPLEMENTS,2766;TAX_DISEASE_HIGH_BLOOD_PRESSURE,117;WB_1406_DISEASES,117;WB_1432_HYPERTENSION,117;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,117;TAX_DISEASE_ATRIAL_FIBRILLATION,95;RETIREMENTS,2314;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1615;WB_137_WATER,2916;FOOD_SECURITY,1188;UNGP_AFFORDABLE_NUTRITIOUS_FOOD,1188;TAX_FNCACT_MAINTENANCE_WORKER,371;AFFECT,2321;USPEC_POLICY1,2650;USPEC_POLICY1,3390;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,2650;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,3390;",Virginia;Americans

311,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/economists-democrats-package-downward-pressure-inflation/,"Congressional Democrats’ climate and health care package is getting a boost from a group of top economists, who wrote in a new letter that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act will lower prices for American consumers amid high inflation. “This historic legislation makes crucial investments in energy, health care, and in shoring up the nation’s tax system. These investments will fight inflation and lower costs for American families while setting the stage for strong, stable, and broadly-shared long-term economic growth,” 126 economists said in a letter sent to congressional leadership Tuesday, which was first obtained by CNN. The letter was signed by key economists including former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Obama Labor Department chief economist Betsey Stevenson, Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf, and Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, among others. “This started to come together late last week with some of the signatories connecting with each other to discuss how they could highlight the economic value of the bill and push back on some of the economic disinformation surrounding it,” a source familiar said of the letter. The economists touted the bill’s historic $369 billion investments in combating the climate crisis and, they wrote, it will “quickly and noticeably bring down health care costs for families” by allowing Medicare to negotiate certain prescription drug prices, along with extensions to expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies. Those investments, the group wrote, “would be more than fully paid for,” pointing to its provision to impose a 15% minimum tax on certain corporations. “This proposal addresses some of the country’s biggest challenges at a significant scale. And because it is deficit-reducing, it does so while putting downward pressure on inflation,” the economists said. That relief comes as prices continue to rise, with inflation hitting 40-year highs. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that inflation surged to a pandemic-era peak in June, with US consumer prices jumping by 9.1% year-over-year.  The bill, which was negotiated by moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, is currently undergoing a technical process with the Senate parliamentarian known as the “Byrd Bath,” a test designed to keep out extraneous provisions from legislation using the reconciliation process. Once the legislation has gone through that process, Democrats should be able to pass the bill with a simple majority. It remains to be seen, however, whether key holdout Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat from Arizona, will vote with her party on the legislation. Schumer said Monday he expects the parliamentarian’s process to be complete and for the Senate to vote on the bill this week ahead of the August recess. “This week the Senate will take action on a groundbreaking piece of legislation, one that we haven’t seen in decades,” he said on the Senate floor. “Over the coming days, both sides will continue conversations with the parliamentarian in order to move forward the bipartisan ‘Byrd bath’ process. Our timeline has not changed, and I expect to bring this legislation to the Senate floor to begin voting this week.” Some economists have said the legislation would do little to curb rapidly rising prices, particularly in the short term. Moody’s Analytics estimates that the legislation would have a “small” impact on inflation, and the Penn Wharton Budget Model also indicated it would have little impact on prices.      And Senate Republicans opposed to the legislation are pointing to an analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which said the bill would raise taxes on Americans. Kimberly Clausing, one of the signers of the letter and an economist at the UCLA School of Law, disputed the JCT’s analysis, suggesting in a tweet that it was incomplete. “Many key factors are left out in these tables including, importantly, the effects of deficit reduction, the positive effects of the spending on clean energy, and the benefits from lower drug prices,” Clausing wrote.

227,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/best-academic-planners,"Whether a student is out to make a major jump in class rank or wa already nabbing straight As but could still benefit from a bit more organization, an academic planner is pretty much the key to success. But a paper planner, really? For a group that does literally everything on their phones? Absolutely. Sales of paper planners are soaring with students. “Despite being digitally native, Gen Z are looking for alternatives to the screens which dominate their lives,” reports Taymoor Atighetchi, founder and CEO of Papier. “In fact, Gen Z are five times more likely to take a digital detox than any other generation, and we’re seeing that in sales of our paper products, particularly planners for those going to college.” That makes sense. Today’s students are busy in a way even full-fledged adults aren’t, feeling more pressure to excel than their parents may have. They keep unique schedules, balancing schoolwork with sports and clubs, jobs, family obligations and, hopefully, some semblance of a social life, observes Wendy L. Patrick, a lecturer at San Diego State University who works with her students on time management. Read on for some of the best planners to help high school and college students conquer the academic year ahead. StriveZen 18-Month Planner $19.99 at Amazon This spiral-bound hardcover covers through December 2023, and allows for scheduling at 15-minute intervals. “If overwhelmed by a big project, break it down into more specific tasks, ideally things that can be completed in half an hour or less,” advises Anita Williams Woolley, professor of organizational behavior and theory at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. “And schedule them on your calendar.” Passion Planner Weekly Academic Hardcover $50.99 From $38.24 at Passion Planner The Passion Planner kept popping up in our chats with experts and students. “We hear from Gen Z students every day on our education platform, and this is one planner that’s very popular among them,” shares Kevin Joey Chen, content director at Studyverse, a virtual study hall. “Students tell us the Passion Planner is practical, but also inspirational, because it begins with the Passion Roadmap, where students brainstorm goals for various milestones.” Rocketbook Reusable Academic Planner From $39.99 at Amazon This planner merges analog with digital seamlessly, and is the top pick of Kelly P. Dillon, an associate professor of communication and digital media at Wittenberg University. Students take lecture notes, plan projects, brainstorm — essentially anything. Then, with the free Rocketbook app, they can digitize the pages, sending them to classmates or teachers through the cloud. It can even transcribe and search keywords when looking for specific files. Sugarx Studio To Do Today 24-Hour Daily Planner $7.99 at Amazon This budget-friendly option includes space for daily goals, a to-do checklist and notes in a 24-hour format. Why would being able to schedule out the middle of the night matter? Because something very important should be happening then. “It is incredibly easy for students to get into an irregular sleep pattern, where they are staying up late at night, making it very difficult to get up for and do well in classes,” says Woolley. For students who do struggle with that common pattern, actually scheduling in time to sleep, as simple as it sounds, can help. Ditsy Icon Composition Notebook $14 at Urban Outfitters Not all planners have to be, well, actual planners, insists organization expert Marie Kondo, star of the Netflix show “Tidying Up With Marie Kondo.” “Every student has their own working style and their own way of thinking,” Kondo says. “Choosing a plain notebook gives each individual the chance to discover which organizational methods work best for them, and to go off the beaten path whenever creativity strikes.” We love the rounded edges on this kitschy notebook. Blue Sky Day Designer $39.99 $28.99 at Amazon “This is my absolute favorite planner,” says Christina Garrett, a time management coach for students at California State University Long Beach. She likes that its structure allows the student to easily assign different levels of importance to tasks. “True impact comes from knowing what is worth spending the most time on,” she says. This snappy pick comes with a bookmark and handy pockets. Papier Brain Food Academic Year Planner $32 at Papier How cute is this? Very. But this hardback planner is super useful too, with finance and meal plan trackers and handy term timetables.  And whether a night owl, an early bird or neither, strategizing to capitalize on the time of day when one is ready to think is crucial. “Creating a timetable is the only way to accomplish this balancing act,” says Patrick. “Trying to concentrate during the wrong window is a literal waste of time.” Post-it Self-Care Planning Notes $8.99 at Target For the students who get so immersed in their breakneck days that they sometimes forget to eat, enter these plan-ahead sticky notes. “It’s silly of adults to think that our students are managing less stress than we are,” says Garrett. “Flexibility and leaving space for mental health breaks and self-care is paramount to meeting goals.” Clever Fox Weekly Pocket Planner $17.99 at Amazon In a bright color that’s easy to spot and sizing up at just 3.7 by 6.7 inches, this portable planner is sure to be taken everywhere it needs to be, which is essential. “The planner needs to be with the student at all times,” says Frank Buck, author of “Get Organized!” and a former school principal. “But making that happen is often a challenge.” Notebook Paper Dry-Erase Peel-and-Stick Giant Wall Decals $39 at Urban Outfitters In that same spirit of making sure a planner is always within reach, we found these awesome wall decals. For students who really just want to see what’s coming up next at a glance, this four-piece set will let them start each day in the know. The decals are easily removed from walls, so they’re good to go in dorms. Order Out of Chaos Academic Planner $19.99 at Amazon The unique layout of this planner, which was vetted by students, lets you see when assignments are due and extracurriculars are happening alongside free blocks of time. Why is that important? “It’s not enough to know what you have to do,” says Leslie Josel, an academic coach for teens with learning challenges based in New York. “You need to see when you have the time to do it.” Rifle Paper Co. 12-Month Academic Planner $18 at Rifle Paper Co. This pretty planner is foil-embossed, has thread-stitched binding and, most importantly, offers up loads of space for spontaneous notes above and beyond everyday details. That’s a must, says Garrett. “While we may have to-do lists for every day of the week, it’s vital to remember why we are putting forth the effort. A great planner looks at the big picture,” she says.",Leslie Josel;Kevin Joey Chen;Anita Williams Woolley;Frank Buck;Taymoor Atighetchi;Marie Kondo;Marie Kondo;Christina Garrett,Wittenberg University;Netflix;Rifle Paper Co;Rifle Paper Co;San Diego State University;California State University Long Beach;Urban Outfitters;Urban Outfitters;Urban Outfitters;Carnegie Mellon University Tepper School Of Business,"EDUCATION,713;EDUCATION,1191;",New York
2,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/pact-act-senate-jon-stewart/,"Comedian Jon Stewart and veterans’ advocates on Monday called on senators to stay overnight when they return to Capitol Hill to pass a stalled bill aimed at expanding health care access for military veterans who became ill after being exposed to toxic burn pits. “They’re allowed to stay open past five,” Stewart said on the US Capitol steps Monday morning, joining burn pit protesters who have remained there over the weekend as the bill remains in limbo. “So my suggestion to this Senate would be when you come back, if all the members aren’t here, keep the lights on. Keep the doors open. And don’t leave here tonight, until you do the right thing by these folks.” While Senate Democrats voted unanimously for the measure last week, Republicans voted against a procedural step to advance the legislation, effectively stalling the Honoring Our PACT Act, which aims to provide assistance to veterans who have become ill after being exposed to burn pits during their military service. Matt Zeller, a major in US Army Reserves and senior adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, also told CNN’s Kate Bolduan that Republicans should move to support the PACT act now, with no time to waste. “We’re going to stay here until this gets done because we’re doing this for the people who have died. We’re doing this for the people who are dying,” Zeller said. “And we’re going to do this most importantly for the people who will die if we don’t do this now.” A new vote is expected to occur early this week but not Monday night, according to a senior Democratic aide familiar with the matter. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to bring the procedural vote – which requires 60 senators to advance – back up to consider early this week and offer two amendments sought by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania for a vote at a 60-vote threshold. If Republicans accept that offer, it could pass early this week – though any one senator can object and slow the process down.  Stewart has knocked the GOP for holding up the bill’s progress and for misinterpreting the proposal. He traded online barbs with Republican senators’ newfound opposition to the bill that they both voted for in June. On Monday, Stewart addressed the feud. “You can attack me all you want, and you can troll me online,” he said. “But here’s the beautiful thing. I don’t give a shit. I’m not scared of you. And I don’t care. These are the people that I owe a debt of gratitude to and we all owe a debt of gratitude to, and it’s about time we start paying it off.” “Can we please not force veterans, disabled from their heroism and sacrifice, to stand outside the Capitol building, days on end, waiting on this Congress to do the thing they already did on June 16? It passed 84 to 14. Nothing changed in it,” Stewart said Monday. He added: “Ask any senator, any one of the senators that changed their votes point to the section of the bill that changed that made your vote go from desk to no point to the section of the bill that’s filled with pork point to the section of the bill that is not being spent on veterans. You won’t because you can’t because it’s not there.” Toomey was one of a few Republicans who voted to block the bill designed to help US military veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. He defended his vote Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying he blocked the bill because of an accounting provision in the language. Toomey said the bill as written would “allow our Democratic colleagues to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending spree.” He has said he wants a vote on his amendment to change the spending categorization before he agrees to allow the bill to come to a vote. It’s unclear as of early Monday whether Schumer’s proposal will be enough to assuage Toomey’s concerns.

628,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/election-deniers-voting-key-states/,"Republican candidates who espouse Donald Trump’s false claims that the last presidential election was stolen are steadily advancing through primaries for positions to oversee the next one in swing states. The latest instances came this week in Arizona and Michigan. Mark Finchem, who attended the January 6, 2021, rally before the attack on the US Capitol but has denied he participated in the riot, won the GOP nomination for Arizona secretary of state, the state’s top election official. Abraham Hamadeh, who has pledged to “take the fraud in our 2020 election seriously,” emerged as the Republican nominee for Arizona attorney general. And Kari Lake, an outspoken promoter of election conspiracy theories, will win the state’s Republican gubernatorial primary, CNN projected Thursday.  In Michigan, Tudor Dixon prevailed as the GOP nominee for governor. Dixon said at a debate in May that she believes Trump won the state in 2020, though during an interview with Fox News last weekend she did not directly answer if she thought the election was stolen. Two other election deniers are likely to join her on the ballot. The state party endorsed Kristina Karamo, who has claimed she witnessed irregularities during the last election, for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno, who was involved in a legal case challenging the 2020 results, for attorney general at a convention in April and will make its formal picks for those positions later this month.  Results in Tuesday’s races come after Jim Marchant, who has said his top priority would be to “overhaul the fraudulent election system,” won the Republican nomination for secretary of state in Nevada in June. And in May, Pennsylvania Republicans nominated Doug Mastriano, a leader in the push to overturn the 2020 election results in the state, for governor. If he wins the general election, Mastriano would have the ability to appoint the secretary of state. All four states helped seal Joe Biden’s 2020 victory, and will likely be critical again in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Each of these candidates was endorsed by Trump, who applied pressure on just these sort of state officials to overturn the results of the last election, and has given every indication he wants to run for the White House again. Despite warnings from voting rights advocates and even some members of their own party – as well as a complete lack of evidence of widespread fraud – Republicans who embrace lies about the last election have repeatedly experienced success in the 2022 primary season. Among the key states from the 2020 race, Georgia stands out as the notable exception: Gov. Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Attorney General Chris Carr defeated Trump-backed challengers who echoed the former President’s unfounded election claims.  But the reality is that nationwide, a majority of Republicans agree with those claims. A recent CNN poll found that two-thirds of Republicans said that Biden’s win was not legitimate and that 72% said the party should be “very” or “somewhat” accepting of candidates who believe the 2020 election was stolen.  The Point: As long as Trump’s false claims of fraud remain a mainstream view within the Republican Party, election deniers will continue to rise up the ranks. That could have unprecedented implications for how elections across the country are run.  This story has been updated to include CNN’s projection in the Arizona gubernatorial primary.

81,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit/,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia, according to a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official, despite warnings from Biden administration officials, who are worried about China’s response to such a high-profile visit.  The stop – the first for a US House speaker in 25 years – is not currently on Pelosi’s public itinerary and comes at a time when US-China relations are already at a low point. The Taiwanese official added that she is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight. It is unclear when exactly Pelosi will land in Taipei.  The US official added that Defense Department officials are working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe.  Pelosi arrived in Singapore on Monday for the first official stop of the Asia tour, where she met with the country’s president, prime minister and other top officials.   On Tuesday, Malaysia’s state media Bernama confirmed that Pelosi and a congressional delegation had arrived in the country and were scheduled to meet with the prime minister and parliament speaker.  The delegation’s itinerary includes stops in South Korea and Japan, but no official mention has been made of a visit to Taiwan. During a regular foreign ministry briefing Monday, China warned against the “egregious political impact” of Pelosi’s planned visit to the self-governing island that China claims as a part of its territory and reiterated that its military “won’t sit by idly” if Beijing feels its “sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being threatened. “We would like to tell the US once again that China is standing by, and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army will never sit idly by. China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters, when asked about the fallout from Pelosi leading a congressional delegation to Taipei. “As for what measures, if she dares to go, then let’s wait and see,” Zhao added.   Though China’s military did not mention Taiwan, the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command said it would “bury incoming enemies” in a video posted online Monday showing off its weaponry and fighting tactics. “Firmly stand by and ready for the fighting command; Bury all incoming enemies,” a message posted on Weibo said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the administration’s line that it is Pelosi’s decision whether she visits, adding, “we do not know what Speaker Pelosi intends to do.” “Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government,” Blinken said at the United Nations on Monday afternoon. “The decision is entirely the Speaker’s.” Blinken said that such a visit has precedent, noting past speakers and members of Congress have visited Taiwan. “And so if the speaker does decide to visit and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing,” Blinken said. “We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in in any escalation going forward.” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby earlier on Monday that the Biden administration will support Pelosi on a trip to Taiwan. “We want to make sure that when she travels overseas, she can do so safely and securely and we’re going to make sure of that. There is no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There is no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,” Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.” “We shouldn’t be as a country – we shouldn’t be intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions. This is an important trip for the speaker to be on and we’re going to do whatever we can to support her,” Kirby continued. Asked if the US was prepared for fallout with China over the visit, Kirby said that “there is no change to our policy. No change to our focus on trying to keep a free and safe and open Indo-Pacific.” The issue of Taiwan remains one of the most contentious. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed it at length in a two-hour-and-17-minute phone call on Thursday, as tensions mounted between Washington and Beijing.  “The question of Taiwan is the most sensitive, important core issue in China-US relations,” said Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang at the Aspen Security Forum in July. While Biden has said publicly the US military did not believe it was a good time Pelosi to visit Taiwan, he has stopped short of telling her directly not to go, according to two sources. Administration officials have worked over recent weeks to apprise the House speaker of the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island of 24 million residents, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials. But Biden did not believe it was his place to tell her she should not go, and he has avoided commenting publicly about her trip since his initial statement on July 21. Biden said last month that the US military opposed Pelosi visiting Taiwan, though since then has refused to elaborate on the warnings. The White House has said it is up to the House speaker where she travels. Still, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said he’d discussed a visit to Asia with Pelosi. The administration takes extra care for Pelosi’s security when she travels overseas because she is in the presidential line of succession. Administration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength. Officials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.  Pelosi has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, “To those who died for democracy.” In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19, urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.  “I would say there’s been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,” Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress’ US-China working group, told CNN. “I just don’t think it’s their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in “regular contact” with members of Congress, including Larsen. “On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,” Pengyu said. “The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.” “We hope serious consequences could be avoided,” he added. “This is in the common interests of both China and the US.” Many Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi’s right to travel to Taiwan. “It is Speaker Pelosi’s decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,” said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen’s Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. “In our democratic system – we operate with separate but equal branches of government.” “It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,” he added. Other members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip. California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has “always supported Taiwan.”  But when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, “You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that’s when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.” When asked what she thought, she said, “I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.” This story has been updated with additional details Monday.

380,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/opinions/al-zawahiri-al-qaeda-death-osama-bin-laden-bergen/,"Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Bergen’s new paperback is “The Rise and fall of Osama bin Laden.” from which this article is, in part, adapted. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice.  Let’s be clear about who Zawahiri really was. In remarks at the White House on Monday, President Joe Biden described Zawahiri as a terrorist mastermind “deeply involved in the planning of 9/11,” as well as the bombings of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 and two US embassies in Africa in 1998 that killed more than 200 people.  But in my two-and-a-half decades of intensive reporting on al Qaeda, and based on discussions with key CIA and FBI officials tracking both Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden, as well as militants who knew both men, I have found little or no evidence for those assertions. As for Zawahiri’s role in recent years as al Qaeda leader, he was unable to resuscitate the terrorist group, which hasn’t carried out a major attack in the West since al Qaeda-trained suicide bombers killed 52 commuters in London in 2005. Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.  This is not to undercut the significance of killing bin Laden’s successor. But let’s be realistic about Zawahiri’s importance historically in the hierarchy of al Qaeda and his role in the organization in more recent years.  While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.  Looking ahead, might there be a plausible successor to Zawahiri waiting in the wings who could revive the group’s flagging fortunes? The strike against Zawahiri indicates that his successor will likely have substantial freedom of movement to operate in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Indeed Zawahiri was living in downtown Kabul, a fact that was well known to some leaders of the Taliban, according to senior US government officials.   Zawahiri’s marginal role in al Qaeda before 9/11  Before 9/11, Zawahiri was a relatively marginal player in al-Qaeda, despite his role as one of the public faces of the organization. In 1986, bin Laden first met Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon, at a hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan where bin Laden was giving a lecture. Bin Laden was intrigued by the older, more politically experienced Zawahiri, who had joined a jihadist group at 15 and had served three years in prison in Egypt. The two became close and Zawahiri encouraged bin Laden to imagine the possibilities of overthrowing the regimes in Arab countries such as Egypt. As a result, during the late 1980s Zawahiri influenced bin Laden’s thinking about the need to fight the “near-enemy” Arab regimes such as Egypt. But by the time bin Laden had taken up residence in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in 1996 the two men’s relative importance on the “field of jihad” had changed quite dramatically. Zawahiri was a penniless refugee with virtually no followers whereas bin Laden was a well-known jihadist hero the Taliban had appointed to be responsible for all the Arabs living in Afghanistan.   But bin Laden found a way to use Zawahiri for his own purposes – to advance his goals instead of those of this fellow jihadist whose focus was not on the US but on Egypt. Bin Laden released a statement on behalf of the “World Islamic Front,” a joint declaration made by himself, Zawahiri, and other militant leaders from Bangladesh, Egypt and Pakistan on February 22, 1998. The declaration claimed it was now a religious duty for any Muslim to kill American civilians anywhere in the world.  This declaration of war made no mention of Zawahiri’s lifelong goal of overthrowing the “near-enemy” Egyptian regime and instead was focused on bin Laden’s “far-enemy” goal of attacking America. Bin Laden had co-opted Zawahiri to be part of his holy war against the US, not the other way around, which was the dominant narrative in the years after the 9/11 attacks. There is no evidence that bin Laden’s decision to target the US had any input from Zawahiri, despite later claims that Zawahiri was really the “brains” behind bin Laden.  The troika who founded and ran al-Qaeda was bin Laden at the apex and his two key lieutenants, the Egyptian military commanders, Abu Ubaidah and Abu Hafs al-Masri (whose real name was Mohammed Atef), both of whom had been on bin Laden’s payroll since the beginning of 1987. They were bin Laden’s men, not Zawahiri’s.  Like other reporters, I had inflated Zawahiri’s importance to bin Laden’s thinking in my 2001 book, “Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden.” After examining all the evidence, I have since concluded that Zawahiri was a marginal figure when it came to influencing bin Laden’s views, and that he played only a small role in the actions of al-Qaeda in the years leading up the 9/11 attacks.  This view is also shared by Michael Scheuer, who led the bin Laden unit at CIA from 1996 to 1999, by Daniel Coleman, the most knowledgeable FBI agent investigating bin Laden in the years before 9/11 and by Montasser al-Zayyat, who spent years in prison in Egypt with Zawahiri.   Noman Benotman, a leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, who knew both men, also said it was bin Laden who told Zawahiri, “Forget about the ‘near enemy’ [the Egyptian government]. The main enemy is the Americans because they dominate the whole area and they’re supporting these Arab regimes.”  According to the 9/11 Commission, it was bin Laden, Abu Hafs al-Masri, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed an operational planner of 9/11, who discussed what American targets to hit. They selected the US Capitol, the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Zawahiri was not involved in deciding to attack these targets, according to the Commission.  Bin Laden formally merged Zawahiri’s own Egyptian Jihad Group into al-Qaeda in June 2001. Feroz Ali Abbasi, a Ugandan Briton who was then training at an al-Qaeda camp, described the merger as “more like the assimilation” of Zawahiri’s group. At this point, Zawahiri’s group consisted of only ten men, according to Abu Walid al-Misri, who edited the Taliban’s Arabic-language newspaper. Abu Jandal, one of bin Laden’s key bodyguards, put the number of Zawahiri’s followers at seven Egyptians.  It was only in the summer of 2001 that bin Laden told Zawahiri the details of the upcoming attacks on New York and Washington.  Months after the 9/11 attacks, Abu Hafs al-Masri was killed in a US airstrike and Zawahiri succeeded him as bin Laden’s deputy. For the next decade bin Laden and Zawahiri both disappeared until bin Laden was tracked down by the CIA to the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where he was killed in a US Navy SEAL operation in early May 2011.   Zawahiri takes over al Qaeda  Even though Zawahiri had been bin Laden’s deputy since 2001, it took more than six weeks for the group to announce Zawahiri’s ascension to the top spot. Saif al-Adel, an Egyptian former Special Forces officer was appointed “caretaker” leader of al Qaeda in the wake of bin Laden’s death, according to CNN. Adel had long played a prominent role in the terrorist group.  Eventually Zawahiri was appointed to the top job but proved so incompetent in the job that al-Qaeda and its most successful affiliate, ISIS, formally split in 2014.  It was the first time in its history that al-Qaeda had officially rejected one of its affiliates, and this was not a sign of strength since ISIS was now the most lethal terrorist group in the world.  During Zawahiri’s time as leader of al Qaeda, the terrorist group was never able to launch an attack in the US, nor against American interests around the world. (An al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen was in communication with a Saudi military officer who killed three US sailors at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2019, but the central al Qaeda organization led by Zawahiri seems to have had no role in that attack.)   A possible successor? The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has given al Qaeda “increased freedom of action” in Afghanistan according to a report by the United Nations released in May. Zawahiri apparently felt comfortable at his safehouse in Kabul where he produced video messages, according to senior US officials.  According to the UN, Zawahiri “issued more frequent recorded messages after the Taliban took over Afghanistan last August,” appearing in eight videos. And al Qaeda also renewed its pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Taliban, according to the UN.  The most likely successor to Zawahiri is Saif al Adel – the former al Qaeda caretaker when bin Laden was killed – who lived in Iran for years after 9/11 and could already be back in Afghanistan.   Adel fought the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s, which is how he became part of al Qaeda during its earliest days. According to senior Saudi counterterrorism officials, from Iran, Adel authorized al Qaeda’s branch in Saudi Arabia to launch a campaign of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores of people.  If it is Adel who is tapped for the top job in al Qaeda, he will likely do a far better job of resuscitating al Qaeda than Zawahiri did, which, admittedly, is a low bar.

687,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/tech/baidu-robotaxi-permits-china/,"Tech giant Baidu announced Monday that it has obtained permits to operate fully autonomous taxis without any human assistants on board in two of China’s megacities, marking a first for the country. Baidu, which operates China’s largest search engine, said it received the regulatory approvals for its autonomous ride-hailing service Apollo Go to operate on open roads during the daytime in Chongqing and Wuhan. The cities have populations of some 30 million and 11 million people, respectively. The move represents a notable step forward for Baidu and a potential shift in China’s comfort with the new technology. In other cities where the company’s robotaxis operate, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Baidu is required to have a human safety operator present in the vehicle.  “We have finally come to the moment that the industry has been longing for,” Wei Dong, vice president and chief safety operation officer of Baidu’s Intelligent Driving Group, said in a statement Monday. “We believe these permits are a key milestone on the path to the inflection point when the industry can finally roll out fully autonomous driving services at scale.” The permits will allow Baidu to provide fully driverless robotaxi services in designated areas in Wuhan from 9 am to 5 pm and in Chongqing from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm local time. Service will be limited at first, however, with just five robotaxis operating in each city. In the United States, robotaxi offerings remain extremely sparse and ridehailing giants like Uber and Lyft have abandoned in-house self-driving taxi efforts.

346,https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/30/us/u-s-nuclear-power-plants/,"Here’s a look at nuclear power plants in the United States. There are 93 commercial nuclear power reactor units licensed to operate in the United States.  The nuclear power reactor units provide the US with about 20% of its electricity.  Other Facts The Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC maintains a threat assessment branch, which assesses security threats to nuclear facilities throughout the country. There are four NRC regions. Sixty-two reactor units are pressurized water reactors and 31 are boiling water reactors. These two types of reactors are the only reactors that are in commercial operation in the United States. There are 31 licensed and operating research reactors in the US. The majority are located at colleges or universities.  Since September 11, additional security measures have been put in place at nuclear facilities, including increased patrols, additional physical barriers and enhanced officer training. After an earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused an accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011, the NRC implemented short-term and long-term programs to enhance safety at facilities in the United States.    Timeline May 26, 1958 - As a part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” program, the first commercial nuclear power plant opens as the Shippingport Atomic Power Station. March 28, 1979 - The Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Middleton, Pennsylvania, partially melts down due to a combination of factors including design flaws, equipment malfunction and human error. The accident remains the most serious nuclear power incident in the United States. 1989 - The Shippingport Station becomes the first successfully decommissioned nuclear power plant in the country. January 1990 - Fuel removal from Three Mile Island is completed.  August 23, 2011 - The North Anna Nuclear Power Station near Mineral, Virginia, shuts down due to a 5.8 magnitude earthquake. February 9, 2012 - The NRC approves plans to build two new nuclear reactors near Augusta, Georgia. It is the first approval of new reactors since 1978. Construction of the reactors is delayed amid funding problems.  October 22, 2015 - The Watts Bar Unit 2 nuclear power reactor, located in Tennessee, receives a full operating license from the NRC. Watts Bar is the first US reactor authorized to operate since 1996 and is also the first plant to comply with new orders from the NRC on Fukushima-related safety strategies. October 19, 2016 - Watts Bar Unit 2 begins commercial operation, making it the first US reactor to go live in 20 years. May 30, 2017 - The operator of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant announces that the facility will close in 2019.  May 8, 2019 - Exelon Generation announces that Three Mile Island Generating Station Unit 1 will shut down by September 30.

597,https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/01/world/human-spaceflight-fast-facts/,"Here’s a look at human spaceflight programs in the United States and around the world. Facts The United States ended its crewed space shuttle program with the launch of Atlantis on July 8, 2011, and landing on July 21, 2011. China and Russia are the only other countries to have independent spaceflight capabilities. India and Iran have both announced their plans to send a crewed spacecraft into space.    Timeline October 1, 1958 - The official start of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). May 25, 1961 - US President John F. Kennedy addresses Congress: “First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.” 1958-1963 - NASA’s Project Mercury. The first manned program’s objectives include orbiting a crewed spacecraft around Earth, investigating man’s ability to function in space and recovering both man and spacecraft safely. April 12, 1961 - Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin is the first human in space aboard Vostok 1. He spends 108 minutes in space and makes one orbit around the earth.  May 5, 1961 - Project Mercury astronaut Alan B. Shepard is the first American in space aboard Freedom 7. He spends 15 minutes in sub-orbital flight.  February 20, 1962 - Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn is the first American to orbit the Earth, aboard Friendship 7. He spends four hours and 55 minutes in space and orbits the earth three times.  1962-1966 - The goals of NASA’s Gemini program include subjecting man and equipment to space flight up to two weeks in duration, docking with orbiting vehicles and gaining additional information concerning the effects of weightlessness on crew members. June 16, 1963 - Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova is the first woman in space, aboard Vostok 6. She spends 70 hours in space and orbits the earth 48 times.  1963-1972 - NASA’s Apollo program seeks to establish the technology to meet other national interests in space, to carry out a program of scientific exploration of the Moon and to develop man’s capability to work in the lunar environment. March 18, 1965 - Soviet Alexei Leonov is the first man to walk in space. June 3, 1965 - Ed White becomes the first American to walk in space, during Gemini 4.

October 15, 2003 - Yang Liwei is the first Chinese man in space aboard Shenzhou 5. July 21, 2011 - With the landing of the 135th and final space shuttle mission, the US space shuttle program ends. June 2012 - China plans to launch the Shenzhou 9, carrying three taikonauts/astronauts, on course to rendezvous with Tiangong-1, a mini-space station, in their first crewed space docking venture. Two crews prepare for the mission, each with a female crewman; Major Liu Wang and Captain Wang Yaping, both Air Force fighter pilots.  June 16, 2012 - China launches Shenzhou 9 with a crew of three, Liu Wang, Jing Haipeng and Liu Yang, from the launch pad at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in western Gansu province. Liu Wang is the first female taikonaut to go into space. June 11, 2013 - The Chinese launch the Shenzhou 10 mission, their fifth and longest crewed space mission, with three crew members: Nie Haisheng, Zhang Xiaoguang and Wang Yaping.  July 29, 2016 - NASA places an order with SpaceX for a crewed mission to the ISS. It’s the fourth and final order under a government-funded program that contracts with private companies with the goal of launching astronauts from US soil again. SpaceX has received two of those orders, and Boeing won the other two. The two companies are expected to launch astronauts in 2019. September 1, 2016 - A SpaceX rocket explodes at its Cape Canaveral launch pad during a test firing. The explosion destroys the rocket and the satellite it was due to launch September 3, 2016. March 2019 - US President Donald Trump’s administration announces it wants to send American astronauts back to the moon in five years. The previous target was 2028. May 30, 2020 - SpaceX and NASA launch Falcon 9, a rocket carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft with two astronauts on board. This is the first launch from US soil since 2011. August 2, 2020 - SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft splashes down into the Gulf of Mexico, ending a historic two-month mission. This is the first time in history that a commercially developed spacecraft carried humans into Earth’s orbit. November 15, 2020 - A SpaceX spacecraft launches from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, marking the kick off of what NASA hopes will be years of the company helping to keep the ISS fully staffed. This is a landmark mission for NASA and the company because it is the first fully operational crewed mission for SpaceX. May 2, 2021 - The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule returns from outer space and makes a parachute landing in the Gulf of Mexico, returning four astronauts from a record-setting mission to the ISS. The astronauts’ safe return marks the end to NASA and SpaceX’s landmark mission, dubbed Crew-1, which set a record as the longest time in space – over 5 months – by a crew that launched aboard an American-built spacecraft.  July 11, 2021 - Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity space plane, carrying founder Richard Branson of Virgin Group, Ltd. and three colleagues, launches from Spaceport America in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. After a successful detachment from its mothership WhiteKnightTwo, the space plane makes a return landing at Spaceport America. July 20, 2021 - Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, travels to the edge of space and back on an 11-minute, supersonic joy ride aboard the rocket and capsule system developed by his space company, Blue Origin. Riding alongside the multibillionaire are Bezos’ brother, Mark Bezos; Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pilot and one of the “Mercury 13” women who trained to go to space in the 20th century but never got to fly; and an 18-year old recent high school graduate named Oliver Daemen who was Blue Origin’s first paying customer and whose father, an investor, purchased his ticket. Funk and Daemen become the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. September 18, 2021 - Four Inspiration4 crew members return to Earth from a three-day extraterrestrial excursion aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, marking the end of the first-ever flight to Earth’s orbit flown entirely by tourists or otherwise non-astronauts. The passengers include 38-year-old Jared Isaacman, who personally financed and arranged the trip with SpaceX and its CEO, Elon Musk; Hayley Arceneaux, 29, a childhood cancer survivor and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital physician assistant; Sian Proctor, 51, a geologist and community college teacher with a PhD; and Chris Sembroski, a 42-year-old Lockheed Martin employee and lifelong space fan who claimed his seat through an online raffle. October 13, 2021 - Star Trek actor William Shatner blasts off onboard a Blue Origin suborbital spacecraft, before parachuting to a landing, making Shatner the oldest person ever to travel to space.  October 16, 2021 - China launches a three-person crew into space, headed for the new Tiangong space station. There, they will test the station’s technology and conduct spacewalks over 183 days, or just about six months – the country’s longest mission yet. July 20, 2022 - NASA announces that sometime between late August and early September, the uncrewed Artemis I will launch on a mission that goes beyond the moon and returns to Earth.

120,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/health/resilience-strengthen-coping-skills-wellness/,"Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. Kendra Kubala logs off her last telehealth session after a long day of appointments. She spends many of her working hours as a clinical psychologist offering online mental health check-ins, something she had to adapt to quickly when the pandemic began. Kubala provides guidance on how to practice resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, which allowed her to treat frontline workers, such as grocery store employees, at the start of the pandemic, she said. Being resilient is more challenging when there seems to be no end in sight to difficulties, such as living with Covid-19, said Kubala, who practices in New York and Pennsylvania.  Humans inherently want things to be logical, and we love a beginning, middle and end, she said. “When we don’t have that readily identifiable ending,” Kubala said, “it can create some excessive worry that might lead to anxiety.”  Resilience is a skill, not a personality trait, she said, so you can strengthen it with various strategies.  Practice mindfulness Many people mistakenly believe mindfulness only includes meditation, but it’s also about being present in the moment, Kubala said. One way to do so is to pay attention to your five senses, she said. Focus on what you can hear, see, taste, smell and touch when you may be feeling overwhelmed, Kubala said.  “Recognizing what’s happening in that moment can sometimes calm us down in a way that allows us to move forward in a more predictable, steady way,” she said. Have a consistent routine Some people like to keep a daily routine, which can help them feel more in control of their lives, said Jason Moser, professor of clinical science, cognition and cognitive neuroscience at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Routines can include anything that has positively affected your mental health in the past, such as having a sleep schedule or eating healthy foods, he said.  Exercising outdoors is another healthy activity to include in your toolbox of skills, and it can be done with a partner, Moser said. Nature can also allow you to broaden your perspective, said Ethan Kross, professor of psychology and management and organizations at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. When he goes on walks, he makes a concerted effort to look at the trees, some of which may have been growing for hundreds of years, he said. “I’ve only been here for a few decades,” Kross said, “and this tree has stood through all sorts of stuff like tornadoes, and it’s still standing.”  Build a strong community One of the strongest strategies for coping with adversity is to build a strong support network of people whom you care about, Moser said. It allows you to talk through what you are going through in a safe space and get advice from others with different perspectives, he said.  When you are suffering, you may feel like you are alone, but it can be comforting to talk about problems with others and realize you’re not alone, Moser said.  Other people can also increase your level of accountability to achieve healthy habits or accomplish goals, he said. If you have another person whom you’re accountable to for a morning walk or a twice-a-week run, that social aspect can help make some of those healthy habits stick, Moser said. Talk to yourself like a friend People are much better at giving advice to others about emotional issues than to themselves and following it, Kross said.  One coping strategy is to shift your perspective and start talking to yourself as though you are speaking to another person, he said.  For example, at a difficult time, ask yourself, “How are you going to manage the situation?” Then give yourself advice, Kross said. “This helps them shift their perspective to get them to start talking to themselves like they would to another person,” he said, “which often leads to wiser ways of managing situations.” ",Kendra Kubala;Jason Moser,Michigan State University;Cnn,"EDUCATION,1799;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,1799;TAX_FNCACT_GUIDE,73;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,398;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,618;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,398;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,618;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,398;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,618;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,398;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,618;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,398;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,618;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,398;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,618;TAX_FNCACT_CLINICAL_PSYCHOLOGIST,301;TAX_FNCACT_PSYCHOLOGIST,301;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,754;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,587;WB_1668_LABOR_STANDARDS,274;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,274;WB_1672_WORKING_HOURS,274;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,274;AFFECT,1993;GENERAL_HEALTH,331;GENERAL_HEALTH,2012;MEDICAL,331;MEDICAL,2012;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2236;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,1064;WB_470_EDUCATION,1064;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,1064;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,1064;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1885;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1013;SCIENCE,1819;WB_1406_DISEASES,331;WB_1406_DISEASES,2012;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,331;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2012;WB_1430_MENTAL_HEALTH,331;WB_1430_MENTAL_HEALTH,2012;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,331;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,2012;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,553;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,821;",Pennsylvania;East Lansing;New York;Michigan State University
593,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business/strippers-knights-unions-trend/,"On any given weekend night in North Hollywood, a group of dancers in outlandish costumes holds signs urging customers to stay away from the Star Garden topless bar. More than a dozen of the club’s dancers say they’ve been locked out for four-plus months because they petitioned the owners to reinstate two of their fired colleagues, improve security and safety measures, and recognize their right to form a union.  US strippers haven’t successfully unionized since the effort at San Francisco’s Lusty Lady in the 1990s, but the Star Garden workers are trying anyway — and they’re doing so in an environment where more American workers are leveraging their own power.   That’s in large part because of successful unionization efforts at behemoths like Starbucks\n            \n                (SBUX), Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) and Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), which grabbed headlines and inspired others to launch their own — including grocery workers at a Massachusetts Trader Joe’s and a group of production workers on “The Simpsons.” And employees of video-game company Activision Blizzard\n            \n                (ATVI), where workers voted to unionize in May, even joined the Star Garden dancers during their early picketing sessions in a show of solidarity. The offices of the National Labor Relations Board have been flooded with union petitions: 1,892, to be exact, from last October through the end of June 2022. That’s an increase of 58% compared to the same period the previous year. Unfair labor practice charges have risen 16% in that same time period, the NLRB said. The agency is having trouble keeping pace with the deluge, NLRB director and press secretary Kayla Blado told CNN, adding that the group’s number of field staff has been cut by 50% in the last two decades. Meanwhile, petitions have increased dramatically, catalyzed in large part by Covid-19. Unionized chivalry is not dead “Post-pandemic, people just have a very different view of what their time is worth and what their working conditions should be,” said Erin Zapcic, who is among the cast members trying to unionize at a Medieval Times dinner show in Buena Park, Calif. Currently Zapcic plays the queen at Medieval Times LLC’s only California location. She had previously worked at the company’s Lyndhurst, New Jersey, castle where employees had attempted — and failed — to organize in 2006. But on July 15 this year, a union vote succeeded in Lyndhurst: About 40 performers including knights, squires, trumpeters and a falconer are now members of the American Guild of Variety Artists. “We’re not just 9-to-5 workers,” said Monica Garza, who plays the role of the queen at the Lyndhurst location. “The disrespect from management made it feel more like a schoolyard rather than a professional establishment.” Garza said the show’s cast consists of professional actors, and in the case of some of the knights, trained stuntmen. Yet after the initial pandemic shutdown, she said the Lyndhurst castle reopened in May 2021 with such paltry staffing that they were also asked to clean the facility and work in wardrobe and lighting.  Beyond having more job responsibilities while earning the same wages, Garza said unruly audience behavior has gone unchecked and created safety issues.   One night a woman jumped on stage, grabbed Garza and tried to take the microphone attached to her head, Garza said. Other times, audience members have defied safety announcements by banging silverware and plates, scaring the horses and putting performers at risk, she added. CNN reached out to the Lyndhurst location for comment but did not hear back. After unsuccessful efforts to force management to address these problems, Garza said, the cast members researched the prior failed attempt to unionize — and realized this time, they had social media on their side. “We got enough people in our ranks that were like, ‘This may not be impossible anymore. And it may be incredibly necessary.’ Because in years prior, I think people could hang onto the fact that things were bad, but not bad enough,” Garza said. “It wasn’t until after Covid — when we went in with less people, being overworked, underpaid, inflation out of control.” After the successful union vote in Lyndhurst, the CEO of Medieval Times LLC, Perico Montaner, sent a letter to employees at the company’s other venues. The letter, shared with CNN by an employee, read in part: “Collective bargaining is an uncertain process. Half of all new unions never reach a first contract. There is no time limit on negotiations.”  Montaner ended the letter by telling employees. “Ask yourselves, can you really know what the Lyndhurst, New Jersey employees ‘won’ until you see their contract?” Medieval Times LLC and Montaner did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Lyndhurst’s effort opened the door for the Buena Park employees, Zapcic said. The California show features 50 cast members, who had already been discussing safety problems due to being overworked, she said, and had gathered signatures for a union petition by late July. The Buena Park location did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. They filed a petition with the NLRB on July 22, and a date for a vote has not been set. ‘Starting drama’ In June, employees of the Lyndhurst castle went to a labor conference in Chicago, which was also attended by some of the dancers from North Hollywood’s Star Garden club.  One of the dancers, who goes by the stage name Velveeta, said she is among 18 workers who have been locked out of Star Garden since March. She asked CNN to identify her only by her professional name, for fear of being blacklisted or stalked. Velveeta said she had witnessed a dancer being pulled by her shoe across the stage by a customer, another being slapped and others being inappropriately touched by customers. Multiple attorneys told CNN it is illegal in Los Angeles for customers to touch dancers in strip clubs. Yet Velveeta said the owners ran the establishment assuming the customer was always right, with one of them frequently dismissing dancers’ complaints as merely “starting drama.”  And when a few dancers tried to get a patron to delete a video he took of their colleague on stage — which is against club rules — one of the workers who complained was fired, she added. One day after submitting the petition asking for their colleagues to be reinstated, along with enforcement of the no-photography policy, the dancers were locked out, Velveeta said. “All of us came that night — it was Saturday night — ready to work. And we were stopped at the door by the security guard and told that there was a new thing, you know, now, because we had signed this petition,” Velveeta said. The new policy, she said, was that dancers experiencing a problem needed to find a manager first, even though managers were not always on site. Velveeta said that even if they could get a hold of a manager by phone, they would have to wait until the manager screened the security footage to determine if any action should be taken against the customer.   “Our own autonomy, bodily autonomy … needs to be respected,” she said. “And we need to have a say about what happens to this customer. And be believed.”  CNN’s calls and emails to the owners of Star Garden, as well as their attorney, have not been returned. Velveeta and her colleagues have yet to file a union petition with the NLRB, but the agency is investigating several charges made by the dancers and will be deciding whether they are employees instead of contractors in order to be eligible to form a union. Even though their path to organizing is more legally challenging, Velveeta said the dancers have been buoyed by the success of other union efforts. “We’ve just been just surrounded by the power of the labor movement and the energy around that since the beginning … and really inspired by the Amazon labor union victory,” she said. The pandemic intensified an existing trend “In a way, the pandemic intensified something that was already happening, which was widespread discontent with growing social inequality,” said Cedric de Leon, a professor of sociology and labor studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “What does surprise me is the places where this uprising has taken place.” De Leon points to massive strikes among educators and auto workers in the years before the pandemic. Then, with the “Great Resignation” of workers leaving jobs in late 2021, along came a wave of organizing at smaller businesses — with an emphasis on employees’ health, safety and security.  “The workers at Medieval Times and at Star Garden are not organizing in a vacuum. They’re organizing in a very rich kind of social context in which people talk to each other,” de Leon said. “People hear about other efforts on the part of workers to organize themselves, to defend themselves and to fight for a better life.” Christian Sweeney, deputy director at the AFL-CIO, says it’s notable that more white-collar professions —like the museum curators and video-game developers — are forming unions. And the Starbucks and Amazon efforts show employees aren’t just organizing at workplaces that pay the least, but also at leading companies. “What a union does is give people an opportunity … to come together, to negotiate with management, to have some say over wages, benefits, working conditions,” Sweeney said. “There’s really nothing that can replace that.” ",Los Angeles;Los Angeles;Christian

556,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/biden-victory-lap-legislative-wins/,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law a bill aimed at boosting American chip manufacturing as he kicked off a victory lap to celebrate a string of wins in Washington. The CHIPS and Science Act will invest more than $200 billion over the next five years in a bid to help the US regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing. It is aimed at countering China’s growing economic influence, lowering the cost of goods, making the US less reliant on foreign manufacturing and mitigating supply chain disruptions in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Biden on Tuesday described the law as a “once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.”  “Today America is delivering, delivering, and I honest to God believe that 50, 75, 100 years from now from people who will look back on this week, they’ll know that we met this moment,” Biden said at an event on the White House South Lawn.  The President, who recently emerged from isolation after a rebound case of Covid-19, coughed throughout his speech.  A major focus of the bill is on making the US more competitive with China. The US was once a leader in semiconductor manufacturing but now many American manufacturers import chips made elsewhere as other countries like China ramp up production. The share of semiconductor manufacturing capacity located in the US has decreased from 37% in 1990 to 12% today, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.  The event was attended by union leaders, industry executives from companies such as HP and Intel, congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle and state elected officials. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo also spoke at the event.    According to the White House, companies this week announced nearly $50 billion in additional investments in American semiconductor manufacturing as a result of the newly passed legislation.  “Micron is announcing a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing, critical for computers and electronic devices, which will create up to 40,000 new jobs” in construction and manufacturing, a White House fact sheet says. “This investment alone will bring the U.S. market share of memory chip production from 2 percent to 10 percent.” Additionally, Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries announced a new partnership that includes $4.2 billion to manufacture chips.  Later Tuesday, Biden also signed the ratification of the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO. The addition of the two traditionally neutral countries to the alliance represented a major foreign policy accomplishment for Biden during a trip to Europe for summits in June. Biden said their addition to the alliance would make it “stronger than ever.” “Sweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies,” he said from the East Room of the White House. “They’ll meet every NATO requirement – we’re confident of that – and will make … our alliance stronger and will make America and the American people safer in the process.” And on Wednesday, the President will sign the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promises to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 into law. The legislation expands health care benefits for millions of veterans exposed to toxic burn pits during their military service.  The bill widely expands health care resources and benefits to those exposed to burn pits and could provide coverage for up to 3.5 million veterans who qualify. It adds conditions related to burn pit and toxic exposure, including hypertension, to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ list of illnesses that have been incurred or exacerbated during military service. Biden has long speculated that burn pits played a role in the cancer that killed his son, Beau, in 2015.  The bill signings – along with other related accomplishments like the recent targeted killing of Osama bin Laden’s successor and continued declining gas prices – amount to the possibility that Biden may get the pre-midterms boost Democrats have been hoping for.  With the 2022 midterm elections less than 100 days away, and as Americans have grown discontented through a summer of major economic and political changes, Biden’s political standing among the public has declined.  A CNN poll released in mid-July found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans had said that Biden had not been paying enough attention to the nation’s most pressing problems. The President’s approval rating, in the poll, stood at 38%. And at the end of July, another CNN poll found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted the party to nominate someone other than Biden in the 2024 presidential election.  Before the month’s end, Biden could have some other major opportunities to claim political victories.  Biden faces the real prospect of soon signing into law the Inflation Reduction Act – a version of his landmark climate change and health care bill.   The sweeping bill passed in the Senate along party lines and the House is expected to vote on it later this week.  The legislation would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect. It would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit. The President will also have to make a decision about whether to extend the nation’s ongoing mass federal student loan forbearance before it is scheduled to end on August 31.  Biden is also weighing the possibility of canceling some student loans. It’s an issue that’s sharply divided among partisan and generational lines, but one that could act as yet another political boon among some voters as the country continues to grapple with inflation raising the cost of everyday goods and services.

679,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/weather/flash-flood-forecast-wxn/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, the CNN Weather Brief, which is released every Monday. You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.  In less than two months we have seen at least four historic flood events occur across the country. Yellowstone flooded in mid-June, followed by the torrential flooding in St. Louis, then Kentucky, and just this weekend we had major flooding in Death Valley. “On 5 August 2022, a flash flood hit the Death Valley National Park in California, USA. The amount of rain that fell in a few hours (34.5 mm or about 1.36 in) represented 75% of the volume that the area typically receives in a year, making 5 August the second-wettest day since the records started in 1911,” according to Copernicus, a European Earth observation program. This resulted in numerous landslides, burying cars and cutting off roads – trapping roughly a thousand people inside the park.  Another week of relentless rain for some of the hardest-hit areas  The last thing people want to hear this week is that more flooding is possible yet again for the Southwest and portions of eastern Kentucky. But the messaging is clear.   “Heavy rainfall rates will be possible,” said the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Kentucky, adding, “Isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding will be a concern, especially in persistent activity, training storms,” including areas that are vulnerable to flooding due to recent events.  With the ground in eastern Kentucky already so saturated, and creeks still running high, it won’t take much additional rainfall to cause more flooding problems.  “Unfortunately, any flash flooding on Tuesday will prime many of the same areas [in eastern Kentucky] for potentially worse and more widespread flash flooding on Wednesday,” the NWS said.  The Weather Prediction Center is forecasting “generally between 1 and 2 inches in 1 to 3 hours.” which is why that portion of the state is under a Level 2 of 4, slight risk of excessive rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.   “Their slow movement, intensity, and abundant moisture to feed on will mean any of the more intense storms will be able to produce a quick inch or two of heavy rain over the local area,” said the WPC.   President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden traveled to eastern Kentucky today. They visited with families and surveyed the damage as many are still left without power and water.   Elsewhere, heavy rainfall is also possible for the Southwest this week – including hard hit Death Valley. “An active monsoon pattern is expected to continue through the remainder of the week and over the weekend with a favorable monsoonal flow keeping moist conditions in place across our region through the period,” said the NWS in Las Vegas.  These storms associated with a plume of monsoonal moisture will also have the potential to be slow-movers, which will only increase the risk of flooding.   “With deep moisture in place, the threat of flash flooding with any slow moving or training storms will persist,” said the NWS.  Why the extreme flooding won’t give up  The stories are tough to tell and the images are heartbreaking to see. People stranded and even swept away, homes swiped off their foundations, people starting from scratch with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  This summer seems to be different.  We’ve seen so many historic events happening within just weeks apart – sometimes less. It seems extreme, even in this environment of “extremes” that we are currently living in.   We reached out to Greg Carbin, the forecast operations branch chief at the WPC to get his expertise on these frequent catastrophic flooding events. The first thing he mentioned was the heat. “Through early August, a large swath of the U.S. has experienced mean temperatures within the top 5 warmest summers of record,” said Carbin. Adding, “From eastern New Mexico across southeast Texas, and over central Florida, including Tampa and Orlando, it has been the warmest (hottest) summer on record in over 100 years.”  He went on to explain that many of the hottest areas have also been the driest. The dome of high pressure that we often refer to as a “heat dome” is locking in the heat (and keeping the rain out) across much of the South. On the periphery of that heat dome is where these storms are developing and causing so many problems.   “The extreme rainfall events in Kentucky and St. Louis occurred on the edge of the hottest air where abundant moisture and instability were transported north and sustained in regions of focused atmospheric ascent. Thus, the hot conditions are a contributing factor to the extreme rainfall events,” explained Carbin.   The edges of the heat dome are essentially conveyor belts of moisture that have resulted in relentless rain following the same path for hours and days on end, which is what we saw unfold most recently in Death Valley. Another reason for the historic rain is because of the warmer climate. Science has shown that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor – which can result in the ability for more rain to fall within the storm. While we can’t point at one single event and call it climate change, the wetter trend is.  “We already know the potential exists for higher-end rainfall amounts in a warming climate, so it seems that some of these extreme rainfall events, while not necessarily a ‘new normal’, are certainly more likely to occur than our past records indicate,” said Carbin.

618,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/oldest-black-church-excavation-project-reaj/,"Beneath the asphalt parking lot of America’s largest living history museum, gravesites linked to one of the nation’s oldest Black churches remained hidden for decades until last year.  Archaeologists in Williamsburg, Virginia, are now excavating three burials at the original location of the historic 18th century First Baptist Church, launching a monthslong process to unearth information about who was buried there and what kind of lives they led.  Last month, the archaeology team fully excavated the first burial of an individual in a wooden coffin and extracted bone for a DNA sample to be analyzed alongside analysis of the skeletal remains. The archaeology team is now working to prepare the second grave for excavation. For the Black descendants of residents in Williamsburg, this effort is long overdue. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Black residents made up more than half the town’s population and members of the church included abolitionists, teachers and farmers. Since 1956, the church’s foundation has been covered by a parking lot owned by Colonial Williamsburg after the museum bought and demolished the structure.  And it was largely forgotten. Throughout the years, visitors to Colonial Williamsburg parked their cars and walked over the foundation. Children would exit school buses on field trips to the 301 acre site dedicated to preserving the history of the Virginia town as it existed in the 18th century to “feed the human spirit by sharing America’s enduring story.” But that history was not inclusive, historians and residents said.  The experiences of Black community members in the colonial era have often been left out, said Connie Harshaw, the president of the Let Freedom Ring Foundation, dedicated to preserving the church’s history. First Baptist Church being buried all these years is a testament to this erasure of history, she said.  “It was an asphalt parking lot for more than 60 years with no regard to the people who lived there and who died and were buried there, whose names we don’t even know,” Harshaw said.  The journey to uncover First Baptist Church’s history began in 2020 with a partnership between Colonial Williamsburg and the non-profit foundation. Talks began in the spring of 2020, and digging began in the summer of 2020, Harshaw said.  ‘A lot of reckoning to do’ Alvene Conyers remembers spending nearly every Sunday at First Baptist Church as a little girl. The 75-year-old Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendant community said knowing the church’s foundation was covered by a parking lot was painful. Her mother, a seamstress, would knit her only the best attire to wear to First Baptist Church, with outfits including corduroy jumpers and ruffle-collared blouses to wear with patent leather shoes.  “I felt devalued and dismissed and just unappreciated as a human being,” Conyers said. “Colonial Williamsburg has a lot of reckoning to do.”  The excavation project is the flagship initiative in Colonial Williamsburg’s efforts to better tell and represent the stories of Black Americans living in Williamsburg in the colonial era, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s director of archaeology. He said the fact that the church was covered by a parking lot is a tragic part of the project’s journey, but hopes the excavation begins to remedy some harm. “We’ve ripped up that parking lot and it will never go back,” Gary said. First Baptist Church was founded in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, Virginia’s colonial capital. Members secretly gathered under trees at a plantation to engage in song and prayer, defying state laws that prohibited Black people from congregating in large groups.  By 1818 there was a building on the lot, referred to on a tax document as the Baptist Meeting House. The original structure of First Baptist Church was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. Over two decades later, in 1856, a new brick church on the site of the first building was constructed and remained there until 1956, when Colonial Williamsburg bought and demolished the church as part of an expansion project, placing a parking lot over the historic location. Payment for the property was used to construct the congregation’s current church that sits about a mile away from the original site.  Today, the church remains active and is on the US National Register of Historic Places. Harshaw said people travel from all over to visit the church, with visitors coming as far as Beirut and Kenya.  “It’s no longer simply a community church. It’s a national treasure and everybody’s coming to see it,” Harshaw said. From demolition to dedication Following a change in leadership, Harshaw said the current president of Colonial Williamsburg reached out to her in March 2020 after she previously met with former Colonial Williamsburg leadership and criticized the museum for failing to highlight the stories of the Black residents.  After having conversations with the president about telling a more complete story about Williamsburg history that centered on the Black experience and the church’s cultural and historical significance, Harshaw said the excavation project commenced soon after when the parking lot was ripped up in August 2020.  Last year, following about a year of excavating the site, archaeologists discovered the church’s original permanent structure, a 16- by 20-foot brick foundation atop a layer of soil that dates back to the early 1800s, according to the museum. Archaeologists also identified multiple gravesites.  Although Harshaw said she had no idea there were intact burials on the site, she said some other members of the descendant community were ultimately not surprised when the plots were discovered last year. Older members of the church long spoke about their ancestors being buried at the church based on oral histories passed down generations.  Johnette Weaver, a Williamsburg native and member of the church’s descendent community, said she recalls hearing stories from a church elder about their great grandfather being buried at the original church site.  “For Black people, a lot of our history is oral,” Weaver said. “It doesn’t mean that it’s untrue, it just means it wasn’t written anywhere or inscribed anywhere.”  To date, the Colonial Williamsburg archaeology team has identified a total of 41 burial shafts. Of these burials, only one is marked, by an upside down wine bottle at the foot of the grave. Gary speculates that this grave may have belonged to a church leader or someone of prominence in Williamsburg’s colonial community.  This marked grave will be the last of the three graves to be excavated and analyzed as part of the project. Anthony Pinn, a humanities professor at Rice University, said the discovery of the burials is significant given that under White supremacy in the Antebellum South, Black people were exploited and reduced to their physical bodies’ ability to provide labor. White supremacy also worked to deny Black people family connections and social ties under slavery, Pinn added.  “Burial within the context of the Black church was not simply a recognition of death, but it was a recognition of life, that this person was substantive, had impact on the world, and that they had to be recognized and celebrated for who they were in a much fuller sense,” Pinn said.  Gary said accurately telling the story of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches is at the heart of the project. Following the excavation of each burial, he said the next step is to conduct both DNA and osteological analysis on the skeletal remains to gain more insight into who was buried at the church. The DNA analysis, to be conducted by the University of Connecticut, is anticipated to uncover information about the three individuals’ skin tone, eye color and even their propensity for certain diseases. The analysis of the bones, to be performed at the College of William & Mary’s Institute for Historical Biology, is expected to show how old these individuals were when they died as well as their place of origin, sex, quality of life and more.  Members of the church’s descendant community eventually hope to submit their DNA to assess biological kinship to those buried at the church. At the conclusion of the project, the remains will be reinterred.  Gary said he expects this phase of the excavation project to take about a year, between the actual act of excavating the graves as well as analyzing and reinterring them. He said Colonial Williamsburg also hopes to reconstruct the church with historically accurate dimensions and furnishings to replicate how the church looked in the colonial era by 2026, the 250th anniversary of the church.  “We’re going to put it back exactly where it was,” Gary said. “It’ll be sitting in its exact footprint, as it was the day the congregation built it in the early 1800s.” Gary also said the input of the descendant community will be at the center of how Colonial Williamsburg proceeds with the project, including how to commemorate the site on a long-term basis and how they would like to see the remains reinterred.  Harshaw said she hopes the project signals the importance of telling complete and accurate histories that reflect a diverse set of experiences.  “We are really hoping that we will be an example for the nation,” Harshaw said. “If we can do it in the Commonwealth of Virginia, where you can drive up down I-95 on any given day and see Confederate flags, we are hoping that the rest of the nation will look to see what we’re doing and say ‘you know what, we probably need to do something about the fact that this place looked very different, or there’s a very different and more important and significant story,’ because the bottom line is this: We have a shared history.” ",Connie Harshaw;Anthony Pinn;Shondra Dandridge;Shondra Dandridge;Alvene Conyers;Jacquelyne Germain;Jack Gary,Freedom

131,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/investing/buybacks-exxon-jpmorgan/,"Americans may be wondering why they’re forced to spend more than $4 per gallon at the pump while energy companies are raking in record profits. Even more aggravating: Exxon and Chevron announced last week they’d spend billions of dollars of their earnings buying back their own stock, fattening investors’ portfolios. Oil companies are hardly alone, but they’ve helped thrust buybacks back into the spotlight. The debate about stock buybacks has been raging on and off for four decades, and Democrats are trying to rein them in. But a recent paper from a bipartisan think tank suggests buybacks may not be quite as harmful to everyday people without money in the market as critics suggest. What’s a buyback? Buybacks, which raise the value of a company’s stock and immediately reward shareholders and executives, have been a hot button political issue since they were legalized in 1982. That’s when the Securities and Exchange Commission passed a rule allowing companies to purchase their own shares without being charged with stock manipulation. They’re also incredibly common. Last year, companies in the S&P 500 repurchased a record $882 billion of their own shares. Executives sell more stock in the eight days following a buyback announcement from their companies than at any other time, according to SEC data. These buybacks have soared in recent years as US corporations recorded huge gains and excess profits in the largest expansionary period since WWII. Democrats in Washington also refocused their scrutiny of the practice after former President Donald Trump lowered corporate tax rates to 21% from 35%. The change led to a rapid growth in buybacks. In 2019, the largest American companies spent $728 billion purchasing their own stock, up 55% from 2018, according to the Senate Finance Committee.  What critics say Critics and legislators argue that buybacks allow ultra-wealthy executives to manipulate markets while funneling corporate profits into their own pockets instead of the economy. Corporate stock is owned largely by wealthy Americans: the top 10% of US households by wealth own about 90% of corporate equity. Money would be better spent on companies’ long-term growth and on employees, they say.  Senate Democrats like Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Ron Wyden of Oregon proposed instituting a 2% tax on buybacks at the time.   Now, as the country teeters on the precipice of recession and faces historically high rates of inflation, the practice is back in the spotlight.  Policymakers, worried that companies are using their money to aid shareholders instead of consumers and workers, are proposing increased oversight of the practice.  The White House proposed new rules intended to curb stock buybacks as part of its $5.8 trillion 2023 budget plan. The plan would require company executives to hold on to shares of corporate stock for a certain number of years and prohibit them from selling shares for a certain amount of time after a planned buyback. The White House did not specify the exact number of years.  Discouraging stock buybacks “would align executives’ interests with the long-term interests of shareholders, workers and the economy,” said the proposal, which echoes a long argued Democratic position that buybacks manipulate stock prices and divert money from companies’ growth and innovation. The SEC has also proposed requiring disclosures of detailed information around buybacks including the objective or rationale for the share repurchases and the process or criteria used to determine the repurchase amounts. The big picture Corporations counter that they use repurchases as a way to efficiently distribute excess capital. They might have a point: Last week the Bipartisan Policy Center released a white paper that challenged the need for the SEC rule and concluded that “share repurchases provide significant economic benefits to society.” Its argument largely hinges on a trickle-down effect from shareholders to the rest of society. “Repurchases provide investors, including those beneficiaries with 401ks and pensions that are invested market wide, with additional financial resources that they otherwise would not have had,” they write. “These additional resources may in turn be reinvested or saved, which can provide needed capital for small companies and others to facilitate innovation and growth.” Claims that buybacks detract from other forms of investment are also flawed, says Jesse Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School.  Between 2007 to 2016, Fried found that S&P 500 firms distributed $7 trillion via buybacks and dividends, or over 96% of their aggregate net income, promoting claims of “short-termism.” But during that decade, he found, investment in their businesses substantially increased even while cash balances ballooned.  “In short, S&P 500 shareholder-payout figures cannot provide much basis for the notion that short-termism has been depriving public firms of needed capital,” he wrote.  Buybacks are waning  At the beginning of the year, Goldman Sachs estimated that 2022 would see a record-breaking $1 trillion in buybacks. That’s unlikely to happen. To date, 58% of companies have reported their second quarter buybacks, and they’ve fallen by 12.9% since the first quarter (though they’re still up by about 7% since last year), according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. JPMorgan halted its buyback program in July, signaling a more cautious outlook as the economy flirts with recession. The suspension also came after the largest US bank failed the Federal Reserve’s stress test, sending it scrambling to generate more capital.  Bank of America and Citigroup also fared poorly in the test, which assesses a bank’s ability to lend during a severe global recession with unemployment hitting 10% and a large drop in asset prices.

302,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/opinions/ted-cruz-jon-stewart-veterans-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show” and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. “Their constituents are dying. And they’re going to get it done after recess?”  Those were the words from a visibly angry Jon Stewart after 41 Republican senators last week voted to block advancement of legislation that would help thousands of veterans suffering from cancer, respiratory illness and other ailments. On Tuesday night, the Senate voted to pass the long-sought bipartisan bill. The final vote was 86-11, and the legislation will now go to President Joe Biden’s desk.   Last week, while Senate Democrats voted unanimously to pass the measure, Republicans voted to stall the Honoring Our PACT Act, which aims to provide assistance to veterans who have become ill after being exposed to burn pits during their military service.  Stewart, the former late night comedian-turned-activist arguably has been the most vocal critic of GOP lawmakers who voted the measure down in that procedural vote, a move that looked likely to delay the measure until after lawmakers return from their summer break in September. The veterans don’t have the luxury of waiting another month, he said.  “Tell their cancer to take a recess,” he told CNN one day after learning that the measure had stalled. “Tell their cancer to stay home and go visit their families.”  Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer held the new vote on the measure Tuesday evening, giving Republicans a chance to prove that they actually do support the troops to whom they so often pay lip service.   The GOP tried to score political points by delaying this vital piece of legislation that would assist an estimated 3.5 million military veterans. This issue is literally a matter of life and death for those sickened by exposure to toxins emitted from burn pits. Burn pits were commonly used to burn trash, munitions, hazardous material and chemical compounds at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan until about 2010. They were often operated at or near military bases, releasing dangerous toxins into the air that may have caused short- and long-term health conditions.. But in the past, more than 70% of claims filed for disabilities connected to burn pit exposure were denied by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The PACT Act would fix that. The legislation would provide hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade  to help them. And going forward, veterans exposed to burn pits will now have the presumption of having contracted certain respiratory illnesses and cancers, allowing them to  more easily obtain disability payments.   So why did Senate Republicans block legislation that would help millions of vets last week? Could it be that the GOP doesn’t want to hand President Biden a legislative win on an issue he has long championed – especially so close to November’s midterm election? Some speculate that Republicans backtracked as part of a backlash after being caught by surprise over the deal announced last week by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer – forged in secrecy with West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin – on legislation to address climate change, help lower prescription drug costs and increase tax revenues. Republican Senator Ted Cruz – who not only voted against the bill last Wednesday to aid veterans, but despicably, was seen fist-bumping other GOP Senators to celebrate the blockage of the legislation – claimed it was because the measure contained a budget “gimmick.”  Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who was a leading voice in oposition to the bill, said in a statement after the vote last week that scuttled the bill that if it were to approve the bill in its current form, “Congress would effectively be using an important veterans care bill to hide a massive, unrelated spending binge.” Cruz told TMZ that the bill represented “part of the out-of-control spending by the left.” But Cruz and his Republican colleagues in the Senate in mid-June passed an almost identical version of the bill, which cleared the chamber by a vote of  84-14, (with all 14 “no” votes coming from Republicans). Stewart, who has been publicly advocating for this legislation since September 2020 (and who also championed efforts to increase federal funding for 9/11 First responders) called out Cruz on Twitter. “This isn’t a game. Real people’s lives hang in the balance… People that fought for your life,” he wrote. Stewart is 100% correct about Republican game-playing. The PACT Act passed the House last month with only minor tweaks –  but those minor changes prompted another vote by the Senate. Last week, 25 GOP senators, including Cruz – flipped their earlier “yes” votes to block it. Democratic Senator Jon Tester, who co-wrote the bill with Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, said Republicans’ explanations for why they pulled their support in last week’s vote just didn’t hold water. “My colleagues can make up all sorts of excuses as to why they decided to change their vote for this bill,” he said. All in all, it amounts to the worst type of political gamesmanship, with the lives of America’s veterans in the balance. They deserve far better. And Tuesday night, they got it.

148,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/jill-biden-joe-biden-summer/,"This summer has not been an easy one for President Joe Biden, and no one feels that more than Jill Biden.   His polling numbers are bleak, Democrats fret about the midterms, critics attack his advanced age, and then – on top of everything – he caught Covid-19, keeping him from the person who brings him the most comfort.  Sequestered in Delaware for the last 12 days, Jill Biden’s summer has not gone exactly as planned either. Though in frequent contact with the President, the first lady is staying away from the White House and has not seen her husband in person since July 20. She had been scheduled to meet up with him over the weekend in Wilmington, but the rebound of his illness kept the couple apart – something the Bidens, married 45 years, do not like to be for more than a couple of days, if they can help it.  One person with knowledge of Biden’s agenda and state of mind tells CNN the first lady is concerned about the effects of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have had on her husband, and how her husband carries himself personally. Biden’s communications director Elizabeth Alexander tells CNN the first lady feels those challenges, and “how he continues to meet the moment with courage.”  The President has scored big wins over the past week. His administration announced its successful operation to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri, a mastermind of the September 11 terror attacks, on Monday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin reached a breakthrough that could deliver on some of Biden’s biggest campaign promises, on climate change and prescription drug pricing in particular. And Congress has passed other bills in recent weeks that have registered as major legislative wins for the President, including on gun policy and much-needed semiconductors. But Biden’s abysmal approval ratings are raising questions about whether he will, or should, run for reelection in 2024, a daunting task the White House insists is in the plans. At the same time, Biden’s son Hunter remains under investigation by the Department of Justice – a long-running probe that CNN has previously reported appears to be nearing a critical juncture.  A campaign is a heavy lift that not everyone in the family longs for, say two people with knowledge of internal family conversations. The summer has been difficult.  “(The first lady) feels what he’s going through deeply,” one of the people with knowledge of the Bidens’ relationship told CNN.  Jill Biden had been trying to stay closer to home. In late July, she was supposed to go on a long-awaited, planned trip to Africa. But the home front was calling. Problems and crises were mounting, headlines were negative, kitchen-table issues still a struggle. She pulled the plug on Africa to stay in Delaware, telling aides she just was not feeling the policy impact hit right and the timing was off. CNN spoke with multiple people with knowledge of the first lady’s schedule and state of mind for this story, under condition of anonymity to protect their professional and personal relationships. Several were involved in planning the foreign travel, then putting the kibosh on it. Lately, on summer break from teaching duties at a Northern Virginia Community College, Jill Biden had cropped up by Biden’s side even more, and vice versa. She was with him at the White House’s congressional picnic; present for the Medal of Honor ceremony; bestowing a peck on the lips in front of cameras at Fourth of July festivities. She huddled with him, alone, in the garden next to the East Wing before he left for a recent day trip and waited on the Truman Balcony several times for him to return home.  “The emotional weight is huge for a first lady for the President’s health and well-being under normal circumstances,” said Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush. “I think it’s even more complicated for Dr. Biden by the fact that there is constant public fretting over his health and ability to carry out his duties.”  McBride notes first ladies are the best barometers for how a President is actually feeling. Travel, but make it domestic The Africa trip would have been a four-day, three-country visit to a continent that is often a rite-of-passage for a solo visit from American first ladies. Scheduled to depart during the latter part of July, several government agencies, the Military Office, embassies and security apparatus were enlisted to assist Biden’s travel. At least one advance trip to suss out specifics had already been made.  “It was unexpected,” said the person of Biden’s late-in-the-game decision to call it off.  “An advance trip to Africa, in terms of logistics, in terms of cost, in terms of staff – it’s a lot,” said a former White House official who participated in several such trips during a previous administration.  Asked by CNN if the resources used for the advance trip to Africa would be reimbursed or reallocated, Alexander said, “We conducted survey travel to Africa and we plan to use all information gathered towards travel for the first lady or one of the other White House principals.”  Three of the people who spoke to CNN about the reason behind the cancellation indicated the first lady’s desire to go simply waned as the scheduled departure neared, and she questioned the core objectives.  “The details just weren’t forming in a way that made sense to her from a policy or timing perspective,” said a White House official who was involved in the broader conversation about pulling down the trip. Instead of Africa, Biden downshifted to her sweet spot: Domestic messenger.  In early July alone, she hit Texas, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Georgia and Michigan, talking about everything from pandemic recovery to the American Rescue Plan.  “It isn’t sexy stuff, and it definitely isn’t how she planned to focus her energy,” said one of the people who spoke to CNN about Biden’s priorities as first lady, adding her ability to be a non-polarizing administration emissary in America’s current political clime is “both a blessing and a curse.”  Yet Biden seems comfortable doing what she has done for the last four decades as political spouse, augmenting her husband. It is in part the jumble of bad news and crises, coupled with a handful of international faux pas and a Democratic Party at odds with itself, that have kept the President at home and the first lady on the road. In 18 months, Biden has visited 40 states to the President’s 34, her number far ahead of any of her modern-day predecessors.  “As she has said in her own words – she thinks part of being a successful first lady is ‘just showing up,’” says McBride.  Forecasting their political future A potential second term and the President’s political future “are on her mind,” the other person with knowledge of the Bidens’ relationship tells CNN, adding that concern can at times, “feel heavy” for her. Jill Biden knows all too well the drain a messy and mean presidential race can put on her family, admitting even she underestimated the smears of the last campaign.  It is a challenge for her to at once be her husband’s chief hype-person and his fiercest protector, especially as his advanced age becomes a talking point. A recent CNN poll indicated 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want to nominate someone other than Joe Biden for the next ticket.  “That’s tough, but [Jill Biden] is very adept at conveying a level of confidence in her husband’s health and stamina,” says McBride.  Asked if the first lady is assessing the political landscape as 2024 edges closer, Alexander tells CNN, “As the President has said, he intends to run for another term.” Jill Biden also has zero interest in unveiling a branded initiative, second term or no, telling her staff there are just too many projects and priorities for her to focus on.  “A catch-all logo is not her thing,” says one of the people who work with her.  This summer of hardships for the President has drawn the first lady closer to her family, say several of those who spoke to CNN. There have been robust, multi-generational trips to Camp David, days spent sunning at the beach in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. She is also actively involved in the planning of the November nuptials of her oldest granddaughter, Naomi Biden, a speck of good news for a family besieged by challenging headlines. Naomi Biden announced last week she will marry fiancé Peter Neal in a ceremony on the White House South Lawn, followed by a reception.  Additionally, Biden finally finished decorating her East Wing office. In February, a statement from the East Wing indicated she had hired an interior designer to update her suite of offices to her taste.  Mark Sikes, a celebrity decorator with an active social media presence, and an admitted love of the color blue, confirmed publicly he got the job. Sikes retooled the décor, painting over the shade of pale pink her predecessor had selected for her office walls, among other things. Biden’s workspace now reflected the breezy, “coastal elegance” vibe Biden prefers, says a person with knowledge.  A date this week for Biden to return to the White House and reunite with the President has not been announced, though it is likely it will not be before Joe Biden has a negative Covid test. For now, Biden remains in Delaware – kept company by her rescue cat, Willow.",Elizabeth Alexander;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill Biden;Jill

30,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-jr-deposition/,"Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. sat for depositions as part of the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into the Trump Organization’s finances after months of fighting in court, people familiar with the matter told CNN.  Ivanka Trump’s behind-closed-doors deposition took place Wednesday and Trump Jr. had his deposition last Thursday, the people said. The Trumps were originally supposed to sit for questioning last month, but the death of their mother Ivana postponed their testimony.  Trump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization with his brother Eric Trump, did not assert the Fifth Amendment and answered the state’s questions, one of the people said. It is not clear what he was asked or how he answered the questions. Former President Donald Trump is expected to testify later this month. A lawyer for Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump declined to comment, and representatives from the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The New York attorney general’s office declined to comment. The depositions raise the legal stakes for the Trump family members as they face two investigations, one civil and one criminal, into the accuracy of Trump Organization financial statements. The former President and the Trump Organization have previously denied any wrongdoing and called the civil investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, politically motivated. In January, James’ office said it found “significant” evidence indicating the Trump Organization used false or misleading asset valuations in its financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits.  Trump Jr.’s decision to answer state questions breaks with that of Eric Trump and former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg who both asserted their Fifth Amendment right when deposed in 2020.   In a civil case, the jury can draw an “adverse inference” and hold it against individuals who don’t answer questions.  That is not the only calculus at play. There’s been some discussion over the stigma of asserting the Fifth Amendment and how it would play politically, one of the people familiar with the matter said.  By answering questions, Trump Jr. increases his possible legal exposure. He was involved in several properties, including 40 Wall Street, and certified the accuracy of the financial statements from 2017 forward, the attorney general’s office has said. Ivanka Trump was a key liaison with Deutsche Bank, which loaned the Trump Organization more than $300 million. The financial statements were prepared by accountants inside and outside of the Trump Organization. There is also debate over how the properties were valued given the flexibility over appraisals. The valuations were signed off by Trump’s longtime appraiser Cushman & Wakefield, which is also under investigation.  The firm, which broke ties with Trump after January 6, 2021, has denied any wrongdoing. Banks, which supplied financing, also didn’t lose any money on the loans they underwrote. The New York attorney general’s investigation is in an advanced stage. Lawyers with the office have said publicly that they expect to take some kind of enforcement action but would engage in discussions with the Trump Organization before a decision was made. Investigators have interviewed numerous current and former Trump Organization executives and employees, including Donald Trump’s former assistant Rhona Graff, and several executives in the finance and accounting department. James’ office subpoenaed the Trumps late last year. They moved to block the subpoenas in court, arguing that they shouldn’t have to sit for depositions while there was a criminal investigation. The court rejected their arguments, saying a criminal investigation does not preclude a civil investigation from obtaining evidence. The former President was also held in contempt and fined $110,000 for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents. The judge lifted the contempt order in June. The criminal investigation, led by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, has slowed but not stopped. Earlier this year, Bragg would not authorize prosecutors to present evidence before a state grand jury after raising concerns about the strength of the case, CNN has reported. A special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.  Bragg told CNN in an interview in April: “Anytime you have a parallel civil, criminal investigation, if there’s testimony in that proceeding, obviously we will look at it.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. were supposed to sit for their depositions in July.

69,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/china/china-live-fire-exercises-taiwan-intl-hnk/,"China is planning to conduct live-fire exercises on Saturday in waters near Pingtan Island of Fujian province, which is opposite the self-governing island of Taiwan. The Pingtan Maritime Safety Administration issued a navigation warning about the drills late Thursday local time, prohibiting all ships from entering waters near the island and the southeastern province of Fujian. It said the “live-fire training missions” would take place from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. The news comes amid speculation over how China could respond to a potential visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing sees as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it. Tensions have been simmering between the United States and China over the potential trip, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently warning US President Joe Biden that “if you play with fire you get burned.”  In a separate incident, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it had detected an unidentified drone flying over Dongyin Island – which is controlled by Taiwan but located near mainland China – twice on Thursday, adding that it could not rule out that the drone was used to “gather intelligence” in the area.   The statement from the Defense Ministry made no reference to China and did not speculate over who might have operated the drone. Pelosi had been set to depart the US on Friday for a tour of Asia, though whether she will stop in Taiwan remains uncertain, a person familiar with her itinerary told CNN.  A security plan involving ships and aircraft is being developed by the Pentagon to ensure Pelosi is kept safe should a visit to Taiwan go ahead, according to defense officials.

223,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/100-days-midterms-house/,"As the countdown to November’s midterm congressional elections enters its final 100 days, Democrats face broad and persistent headwinds driven by widespread gloom over the economy and President Joe Biden’s consistently low approval ratings. Though recent polling has provided the party glimmers of hope, those fundamental weaknesses have been compounded by what many accept as a political fact of life: that the president’s party is doomed to a poor showing in his first midterm after taking office in all but the most exceptionally advantageous circumstances. The first nationwide election since Biden defeated former President Donald Trump in 2020 will not provide Democrats that unique boost. Instead, the vote will take place amid economic uncertainty, an ongoing pandemic that has killed more than a million Americans the rupture created by the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn federally protected abortion rights. For Democratic voters, the additional specter of a Trump revival – he is widely expected to run for president a third time in 2024 – and the further ascent of the anti-democratic movement around him has deepened the sense of foreboding.  “My sense is that voters are looking for a level of independence that they aren’t seeing on either side of the aisle,” said Greg Landsman, the Democratic Cincinnati councilman who is challenging Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in November.  Landsman’s calculation is that any backlash over his relationship with Biden will be outweighed by the Trump’s unpopularity. “(Trump) is way more involved in these races than just about anyone else,” Landsman said. “Trump endorsed Chabot. Chabot obviously tried to overturn an election for the guy. I think that is way more inescapable than me and the President.” Republican strategists, meanwhile, view the contest for the House majority as close to a done-deal as possible. A dismal economy mixed with complete Democratic control in Washington, they believe, makes this a straightforward “change” election.  “The Republicans are going to win the House. Period. End of discussion,” said Corry Bliss, a Republican strategist. “If there’s an election in November, Republicans will win control of the House.” None of the non-economic developments over the past few months – the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a wave of high-profile mass shootings or the progression of the investigation by the House select committee into the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot have shifted the GOP assessment that voters’ top priorities remain inflation and a higher cost of living. And while Republicans admit that while the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe has energized Democratic donors, it’s done little to blunt the sense that a GOP wave in the House is approaching. In fact, outside GOP groups are pressing their apparent advantage into more Democratic districts. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading super PAC associated with House Republican leadership, has begun to spend money in multiple Democratic-held districts that were not initially on the group’s list of possible targets, including in Indiana (against Rep. Frank Mrvan), Connecticut (against Rep. Jahana Hayes), and California (an open seat in the San Joaquin Valley after Rep. Josh Harder switched races following redistricting).  CLF president Dan Conston told CNN that the group will also start spending in Rhode Island’s 2nd District, whose longtime Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin is retiring. “Biden’s deep unpopularity and Democrats’ mishandling of the economy has created opportunities in some districts once thought unwinnable,” Conston said. “We haven’t found a single district in America where the President has a favorable image.” Democrats search for a unified message Four years ago, as anger at Trump raged, Democrats enjoyed a fired-up base and a clearly crafted national message that centered on health care and Republican attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act. From California to Texas to Michigan, candidates hammered Republicans over their efforts to repeal a law that helps provide and protect health insurance for millions. Republicans – unable or unwilling to divorce themselves from Trump – didn’t have a straight answer. In the end, Democrats picked up 41 House seats and the majority. This year, however, the message is far less consistent, with Democratic House candidates attempting to personalize their campaigns – betting that their personal brands or emphasis on specific hot-button issues can help them duck below and evade what appears to be a coming wave. There are overarching themes across their campaigns – including Republican extremism, support for Trump’s 2020 election lies and a host of other policy positions – but four years after singing from a shared hymn sheet, Democrats in 2022 are often seen crafting their own tunes. “When the national environment is good for you, you can do that,” a Democratic strategist working on House races said of the strategy that worked for Democrats in 2018. “When it is a bit of a challenge, you got to personalize these races.” The strategist added: “With Republicans, who they are nominating really matters,” specifically noting a race like Ohio’s 9th Congressional District, where longtime but vulnerable Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur is facing Trump-backed Republican J.R. Majewski, a veteran who was outside the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection. Democrats argue that if Republicans had nominated a more traditional candidate in this race, Kaptur – who has served in Congress since 1983 – would be almost a lost cause. But because Republican primary voters backed Majewski, who might struggle with independents and moderate GOP voters, Democrats have a chance to hold a seat they would have had no business otherwise keeping. If enough races unfold in that way, multiple Democrats said, the majority could be saved. “There is a clear contrast in this race,” said North Carolina state Sen. Donald Davis, who is running against Sandy Smith, a Republican who tweeted on January 6 that she had just “marched from the Monument to the Capitol.” To Davis and other Democrats running against Republicans with ties to the insurrection, it would be foolish not to talk about their opponents’ links to the deadly day. In some ways, however, Democrats in 2022 find themselves confronted with a similar problem to Republicans in 2018: How do you deal with an unpopular president? The depth of the challenge is even clearer looking further back to 2010, when then-President Barack Obama’s popularity was dipping and the economy reeling in the aftermath of the financial collapse and Great Recession. Republicans picked up 63 seats that fall.  Even the most upbeat Democrats acknowledge Biden’s popularity is an issue they must address, but few in the party have yet to significantly distance themselves from the President. One reason: It’s nearly impossible for a single House candidate to do. “The person in the White House has a notable impact on down ballot races in the midterms – good and bad,” said Meredith Kelly, the top spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018 and now a partner at Declaration Media. “And there is also very little that a single House Democrat can do about that in their races. So, ultimately embracing the good things that have gotten done is the best move.” Kelly said she is more upbeat now about the prospect of keeping the House than she was a few months ago, arguing that there is an opportunity to charge Republicans with attempting to take away a long held right – the right to an abortion.  “Republicans are on the wrong side of history but also on the wrong side of the country, particularly persuadable voters in these midterms,” she said. Still, many Democrats acknowledge that Biden looms over the midterms – causing some to seek distance. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota told a radio interviewer on Thursday that he doesn’t want Biden to run for reelection in 2024. “I think the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up,” said Phillips, who represents a relatively safe seat in Minneapolis. According to recent CNN polling, not only is Biden’s overall approval rating hovering below 40%, but a remarkable 75% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone else for the presidency in 2024.  Some Democrats, however, are happy to stand with Biden, especially when he visits to talk about a bill or promise he plans to deliver on – a number that could grow if Democrats in Congress pass a climate funding and tax bill that was recently revived in the Senate. Landsman has been one of the candidates who’s stood by the President.  “An event about jobs and bringing jobs to the region, it’s a no-brainer,” said Landsman, who attended an event in May with Biden to rally support for semiconductor legislation. “It is a huge win for Ohio. … It is also a big contrast to Chabot, who voted against it.” As for whether he would attend a strictly political event with Biden, Landsman was less committal, saying it’s “just not something we talk about,” instead choosing to focus on “extreme Republicans” and Chabot’s work to overturn Roe v. Wade. Former Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat elected to a traditionally Republican district in 2008, then swept out by the tea party wave of 2010, agreed that the increasing nationalization of politics – spurred on by a decline in local media – has made it not only difficult, but politically unwise for candidates to divorce themselves from party leadership. But Perriello sees 2022 as unusually distinct from past midterms, in large part because Republicans, even without one of their own in the White House, have, in Trump, their own widely unpopular party leader. “If Trump had stayed quiet, if the moderates in the (Republican) party had regained control, this would’ve been a natural year for Republicans to run the tables,” Perriello said. “But instead, it’s the moderates that are largely in charge of the Democratic Party and being run out of the Republican Party.” Democrats are also attempting to upend conventional wisdom by arguing that, rather than a rebuke in 2022, what it – and the country – needs to claw out of the current malaise is a more robust Democratic majority to help jumpstart the stalled parts Biden’s popular-on-paper agenda. Larger margins in the Senate, where Democrats need every member onboard to move most legislation, and House would give leadership more leeway to advance big ticket items.   “Obviously you need to run through the tape and minimize variables, but you can’t look at how things are shaping up from issues, to candidates, to fundraising and say Republicans aren’t well-positioned,” Republican strategist Matt Gorman said. The ‘Roe’ factor  The landscape is, indeed, more friendly to Republicans. But over the past few months, the number of “variables” have increased, and despite GOP insistence that their fundamental advantage remains in place, Democrats are keen to test whether the stakes have truly changed. That speculation is based on the energetic backlash to the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe and Republicans’ refusal to consider more ambitious gun control legislation in the aftermath of recent mass shootings – issues strategists and candidates believe could stir previously frustrated base voters, especially college-educated Whites, one of the few demographics among which Democrats were already building support.  A CNN poll last week found overwhelming opposition to the high court’s abortion ruling, cutting across party lines. More than 9 in 10 liberal Democrats disapproved of the ruling, but so did 71% of independents and 55% of moderate or liberal Republicans. Whether Democrats can translate that anger into success at the polls, though, remains an open question – especially with 77% of respondents who disapproved of the ruling saying politicians who support legal abortion are not doing enough to ensure access to it. New York Democrat Pat Ryan, the Ulster County executive running in a special election next month to replace Antonio Delgado, who left Congress to become New York’s lieutenant governor, has made the abortion fight a central theme of his campaign against Republican Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive. “The intensity is hard to articulate in a poll, but on the ground, certainly women, but across the board, across gender, race, religion, I’ve felt it. We’ve seen it in our campaign. Our fundraising numbers reflect from grassroots support, our numbers of volunteers. I wouldn’t normally use this as an indicator, but we can’t keep yard signs,” Ryan said. (He will be on two ballots on August 23: the special election in New York’s 19th Congressional District and in a primary race for the new 18th.) Ryan’s race, in a swing district, is widely viewed as a bellwether for November. He is embracing and encouraging the attention – and hopeful that, especially if he is successful, other Democrats will try to emulate his forceful rhetoric. “When you pull your punches and sort of triangulate and moderate, that’s what gets us to where we are right now,” Ryan said, “where rights are being ripped away because we haven’t made clear what the stakes are.”",Donald Trump;Meredith

44,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/entertainment/melanie-lynskey-coyote-ugly-body-shaming-cec/,"“Yellowjackets” star Melanie Lynskey hasn’t shied away from calling out Hollywood for the body shaming she experienced on film sets, even years after her film debut.  In an interview this week with the Hollywood Reporter, Lynskey recounted a negative experience she’d had on the set of the 2000 film “Coyote Ugly.” She said that production staff scrutinized her physical appearance, as well as the physique of her co-stars, including lead Piper Perabo.  “It was ridiculous,” Lynskey said. “I was already starving myself and as thin as I could possibly be for this body, and I was still a (size) four. That was already people putting a lot of Spanx on me in wardrobe fittings and being very disappointed when they saw me, the costume designer being like, ‘Nobody told me there would be girls like you.’”  Throughout filming, she was subjected to “really intense feedback about (her) physicality, (her) body,” said Lynskey, who was interviewed along with her “Yellowjackets” castmates, including ’90s child star Christina Ricci. Both women said that they’d been typecast as “character actors” and denounced use of the word “quirky” to describe themselves. Lynskey recalled when a script changed a description of her character from “beautiful” to “cute and quirky.” “I never liked that word,” she said. Earlier this year, Lynskey opened up about the scrutiny of her appearance that began after her first film, Peter Jackson’s acclaimed “Heavenly Creatures.” While her co-star Kate Winslet went on to play several ingenue roles, Lysnkey said she didn’t experience the same glut of offers. “I kept getting reminded I was not the things you needed to be,” she told Vulture in May. “Thin, confident, pretty. Mostly thin.”  After being criticized for her looks during her early years in Hollywood, Lynskey told the Hollywood Reporter she feels “very protective” of her young “Yellowjackets” co-stars who play younger versions of the four main characters. Luckily, she and her co-stars said, the younger cast members are confident enough to stand up for themselves.

529,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/entertainment/bob-odenkirk-cpr-intl-scli/,"Bob Odenkirk has said he would have been “dead in a few minutes” if he had not received CPR after suffering a heart attack on the set of “Better Call Saul” last year.  In July 2021, Odenkirk collapsed on the Albuquerque, New Mexico, set while filming the sixth and final season of the show. He later confirmed that it had been due to a “small heart attack.” The star, who has been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and Emmy Awards for playing the titular character, has now revealed that he stopped breathing during the frightening episode but was saved thanks to emergency medical care on set.  Though he cannot recall the immediate aftermath of the incident, he now knows it happened at around 5:30 p.m. when the cast and crew were changing shots. At that time Odenkirk, now 59, mounted an exercise bike he used between shoots to watch a Chicago Cubs baseball game on TV, he said. In an interview with the Radio Times magazine this week, the actor recalled: “I went down on one knee, and then I went all the way down. I guess I said, ‘I don’t feel very good.’” The star, who plays con-artist-turned-lawyer Jimmy McGill who takes on the pseudonym Saul Goodman, said his co-stars Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler, and Patrick Fabian, who plays Howard Hamlin, grabbed his head and hand and “started yelling at me to stay on Earth.” “I wasn’t breathing,” he continued. “I mean, if nobody had been there, if they didn’t do that CPR, I’d have been dead in a few minutes.” He had three shots of the defibrillator then emergency surgery to clear the artery he called “the widowmaker.”   “Better Call Saul” is a prequel to the AMC hit “Breaking Bad,” which ran for five seasons between 2008 and 2013. That show introduced Odenkirk as Goodman, an attorney for Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston. In the final season of the show, actors Cranston and Aaron Paul reprise their “Breaking Bad” roles of White and Jesse Pinkman. Odenkirk told the Radio Times that the reunion was “the greatest joy ever,” adding: “The first episode I did on ‘Breaking Bad’ was a big scene with those guys in the desert, at 2 a.m., in a sandstorm. So to revisit the relationship now … I can’t say more than that. Because it’s a mindblower, man.” The series finale is scheduled to air on August 15.",Patrick Fabian;Saul Goodman;Howard Hamlin;Bob Odenkirk;Bob Odenkirk;Bob Odenkirk;Rhea Seehorn;Jimmy Mcgill;Kim Wexler;Walter White;Bryan Cranston;Bryan Cranston;Bryan Cranston;Aaron Paul;Aaron Paul;Aaron Paul;Jesse Pinkman,Cnn,,Albuquerque;New Mexico;Chicago
70,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/brittney-griner-trial/,"American women’s basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time Thursday in a case that has raised concerns she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Judge Anna Sotnikova of the Khimki city court delivered the sentence and fined Griner 1 million rubles, or about $16,400. She said the court took into account Griner’s partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail. Prior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech. “I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” Griner said. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom. “I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,” she added. After the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, “I love my family.” The verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry. Griner’s lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal. “We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in the statement. “This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.” Speaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole. Griner “is not doing fine today,” said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held. Sentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations The harsh sentence comes amid the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s saber-rattling with the US and Europe. The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely. Charge d’Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a “miscarriage of justice,” and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was “unacceptable.” “Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence “puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.” He said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. “This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department’s,” Blinken said. It’s now “up to the Russian side” on whether Griner’s conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.  “We’re still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they’re more empowered to do that, then so be it,” Kirby told reporters in Thursday’s White House briefing. Kirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul and Brittney home.” CNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia’s court proceedings are not legitimate. “This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,” he said. “What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.” Last week, CNN reported that the Biden administration proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, but US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer. The Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.” Griner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.  The Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a “We Are BG” T-shirt,  said after the game the verdict was devastating. “Nobody wanted to even play today,” she told reporters. “How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.” Earlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict “a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare” of her detention. “We are inspired every day by BG’s strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,” the statement reads. Head coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner’s sentence is “unacceptable.” “It’s just heartbreaking,” the coach said. “To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.” In a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.” “The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,” they said. Defense asked for leniency in closing arguments  The court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant’s cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason. In closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued. Even if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor’s prescription, she added. She couldn’t have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said. Boykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication. Boykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, “Basically, it means that you are guilty.” Throughout the trial, Griner’s attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution’s case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport. Her detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.  After she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.  No lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest. On Tuesday, at the seventh hearing in her case, a defense expert testified that the examination of the substance contained in Griner’s vape cartridges did not comply with Russian law. Blagovolina also told CNN her team’s experts identified “a few defects” in the machines used to measure the substance. At trial, Griner testified she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said. “We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. The surprising discovery of mammoth fossils in a paleontologist’s backyard have led to an even more unexpected finding.  The roughly 37,000-year-old remains of a female mammoth and her calf show distinct signs of butchering, providing new evidence that humans may have arrived in North America much earlier than believed. Paleontologist Timothy Rowe first learned of the fossils in 2013 when a neighbor noticed something sticking out of a hillside on some New Mexico property belonging to Rowe.  Upon closer inspection, Rowe found a tusk, a bashed-in mammoth skull and other bones that looked deliberately broken. He believed it was the site where two mammoths had been butchered.  “What we’ve got is amazing,” Rowe said in a statement. “It’s not a charismatic site with a beautiful skeleton laid out on its side. It’s all busted up. But that’s what the story is.” Rowe, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences, is an expert in vertebrate paleontology and doesn’t typically study mammoths or early humans. But he couldn’t help but work on the research due to the discovery’s location.  Two six-week excavations took place at the site in 2015 and 2016, but analysis in the lab has taken much longer and remains ongoing, Rowe said. He is the lead author of a new study providing an analysis of the site and its implications, which published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution in July. “I have yet to fully process the cosmic coincidence of this site appearing in my back yard,” Rowe wrote in an email.  Analyzing the site Multiple finds at the site paint a portrait of what took place there thousands of years ago, including bone tools, evidence of a fire, bones bearing fractures and other signs of animal butchering by humans. Long mammoth bones shaped into disposable blades were used to break down the animal carcasses before a fire helped melt down their fat. Fractures created by blunt force can be seen in the bones, according to the study. No stone tools were at the site, but  researchers found flake knives made from bones with worn edges.  A chemical analysis of the sediment around the mammoth bones showed that the fire was sustained and controlled rather than caused by a wildfire or lightning strike. There was also evidence of bone that had been pulverized as well as burned small animal remains, including birds, fish, rodents and lizards. The research team used CT scans to analyze the bones from the site, finding puncture wounds that would have been used to drain fat from ribs and vertebrae. The humans who butchered the mammoths were thorough, Rowe said.   “I have excavated dinosaurs that were scavenged, but the pattern of bone disarticulation and breakage from human butchering was unlike anything I had seen,” Rowe said. The most surprising detail about the site is that it’s in New Mexico – and previous evidence has suggested that humans weren’t there until tens of thousands of years later. Retracing early human steps Collagen taken from the mammoth bones helped the researchers determine that the animals were butchered at the site between 36,250 and 38,900 years ago. This age range makes the New Mexico site one of the oldest that ancient humans created in North America, researchers said. Scientists have debated for years when early humans first arrived in North America.  The 16,000-year-old Clovis culture is known because of the stone tools it left behind. But an increasing amount of evidence suggests that older North American sites were home to a pre-Clovis population that had a different genetic lineage. The older sites have a different kind of evidence, such as preserved footprints, bone tools or animal bones bearing cut marks older than 16,000 years ago. “Humans have been in the Americas for more than twice as long as archaeologists have maintained for many years,” Rowe said. “This site indicates that humans attained a global distribution far earlier than previously understood.” The position of the site, which is well within North America’s western interior, suggests that the first humans arrived well before 37,000 years ago, according to the study. These early humans likely traveled over land or along coastal routes.  Rowe said he wants to sample the site to look for signs of ancient DNA next.  “Tim has done excellent and thorough work that represents frontier research,” retired Texas State University professor Mike Collins said in a release. “It’s forging a path that others can learn from and follow.” Collins was not involved with the study. He led research at the Gault archaeological site, which contains both Clovis and pre-Clovis artifacts, near Austin, Texas. “I think the deeper meaning of early human attainment of a global distribution is an important new question to explore,” Rowe said. “Our new techniques provided nuanced evidence of a human presence in the archaeological record, and I suspect that there are other sites of comparable age or even older that have gone unrecognized.”  ",Mike Collins;Timothy Rowe,Texas State University;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_DISEASE_FRACTURES,2097;TAX_DISEASE_FRACTURES,2293;EDUCATION,1203;EDUCATION,5517;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,1203;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,5517;WOUND,3309;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1255;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1255;TAX_FNCACT_PALEONTOLOGIST,211;TAX_FNCACT_PALEONTOLOGIST,485;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3459;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3694;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,5814;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,5959;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2780;DISASTER_FIRE,2071;DISASTER_FIRE,2253;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2071;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2253;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,5780;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4271;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2548;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2632;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1790;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,1668;TAX_DISEASE_WOUNDS,3037;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1221;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,5507;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,665;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,665;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,665;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,665;WB_2936_GOLD,906;WB_2936_GOLD,992;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,906;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,992;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,906;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,992;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,906;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,992;TAX_ETHNICITY_CANADIAN,901;TAX_ETHNICITY_CANADIAN,987;SCIENCE,37;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,406;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,1361;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,2142;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,3110;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,3629;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,3925;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,4024;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,4538;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,4629;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,4695;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,4835;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,5019;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,5095;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,5230;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,5318;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,857;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,943;",New Mexico;America;Texas;Canadian;American

For the first time ever, every company listed on the S&P 500 has at least one racially or ethnically diverse director. About 11% of S&P boards were non-diverse in 2020.  And now, the single most important attribute being prioritized in corporate board director searches is racial and ethnic diversity according to PwC’s 2021 Annual Corporate Directors Survey. The numbers back that up. Half (51%) of all current directors support tying executive compensation to diversity and inclusion goals, a 13 point jump from last year, according to PwC’s 2021 Annual Corporate Directors Survey.  Good thing those numbers are finally rising, because today also marks an important deadline for all Nasdaq-listed companies: They must fill out a board diversity matrix that includes the total number of company board members and how those board members self-identify regarding gender, race, ethnicity and LGBTQ+ status. The results will be made public through annual meeting proxy statements or on company websites.  Starting in August 2023, companies trading on the exchange must have at least two diverse board members or explain why they are not meeting this diversity objective.   “Because what we measure signals what we value, the stock exchange is sending a huge message on its priorities,” wrote S. Mitra Kalita, the founder and CEO of URL Media and a former CNN executive in a recent op-ed on the importance of board diversity.  “Disclosing this information to investors empowers shareholders to support companies that embody their ideals and pull investments from those that don’t,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, in a statement praising the move. “Beyond making moral and common sense, increased diversity also makes financial sense. Studies have repeatedly found that companies with more diverse leadership are better positioned to succeed.” The 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police that ignited Black Lives Matter protests around the country also increased demands for corporate action around diversity and inclusion, said Fassil Michael, head of thought leadership at ISS Governance Solutions.  Those demands are being taken seriously, the numbers show. But the numbers don’t show everything.  Although 19% of the total US population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, directors in that group make up just 5% of S&P 500 board seats, for instance. “Many boards still do not reflect the diversity of their customer base or the demographics of the broader society in which they operate,” wrote Michael. “While there is cause to celebrate the progress that has been made in recent years, many companies are expected to grapple with board diversity issues — along with C-suite diversity, workforce equity and fair pay — for the foreseeable future, as the long-term trajectory of many corporate diversity and inclusion initiatives has yet to be seen.” It’s not just about boards. New research by McKinsey found that about 75% of all Black and Hispanic employees work frontline jobs like waiting tables, stocking store shelves, or folding clothes, compared with 58% of white workers. And while three out of four of those workers want to be promoted, only one out of four will be. Black workers make up 17% of hourly jobs at major companies, but just 9% of jobs in low-level supervisory roles, one rung up the ladder.   In addition, frontline hourly employees are nearly 20% less likely than corporate employees to believe that diversity and inclusivity policies make a difference, according to McKinsey.  Big corporations have enthusiastically embraced ESG incentives recently, wrote Alison Taylor, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and executive director of its Ethical Systems program, and Brian Harward, the program’s lead research scientist. But a lot of what they’re doing “appears to be a self-serving strategy to generate positive PR,” they wrote in a joint statement. The current state of diversity efforts by corporations is “disappointing but understandable … Investors pressurize them into what amounts to a box-ticking, virtue-signaling exercise – and it shows.”  Take McDonald’s\n            \n                (MCD), for example. The company announced last year that it would tie 15% of executive compensation to accomplishing annual increases in the share of women and minorities in senior leadership. Sounds great. But at the same time, McDonald’s was accused of mistreating and “redlining” its Black franchise owners, pushing them to the least favorable locations that required expensive and unrealistic renovations, and instituting harsher grading and inspections on their shops.  “What encouraged that behavior?” ask Taylor and Harward. “Was there any relationship between the lack of diversity in senior leadership and this litigation? More broadly, why should executives be given bonuses for meeting intrinsic goals that ought to be central to any company’s values and mission?” The company has denied wrongdoing and settled claims that it had treated Black franchisees less favorably.  Bad news on Wall Street Enjoy the good times while you can because they don’t last forever.  Last year was a lucrative one for the black fleece vest wearers who work in Midtown Manhattan but call it Wall Street. The streets were glistening in the 2021 version of gold … mergers, acquisitions and IPOs.  The economy was back, baby. Covid finally met its match thanks to the hard work of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Those Wall Street warriors were working hard, and their pay reflected it. Average bonuses hit a record high of $257,500, up 20% from the year before. That’s on top of very generous base salaries.  Then 2022 hit.  Covid rates are still at record highs, and shutdowns are roiling supply chains. Inflation, interest rates and a lack of IPOs have hit the finance world hard. M&A activity has fallen by 25% and IPOs have dropped by half since last year. Investment banking revenue at JPMorgan Chase fell by 61% and by 55% at Morgan Stanley last quarter.  Now, year-end bonuses are expected to decline significantly. Those who work in finance can expect to see a nearly 50% drop in their compensation, reports my CNN Business colleague Allison Morrow. Read more here.  Inflation, the hot new word We all know that inflation, at historic highs, has hit our wallets. This earnings season has shown us that corporations have also noticed.  There’s been a 26% increase in mentions of “inflation” so far this quarter from the earnings reports of publicly traded companies, according to new data from Cision.  That has carried over to Twitter, where “inflation” was mentioned 19,518 times versus 827 times in the same period of 2021. Interestingly enough, “corporate greed” was also a much-used phrase among Twitter users talking about earnings reports, with 9,577 mentions compared to only 8 in 2021. Corporations increased their mentions of “interest rates” and “recession” in this quarter’s earnings reports by 9% and 4%, respectively.  But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, seen as a major headwind last quarter, saw a 77% decrease in mentions as a negative factor this quarter while talk of the pandemic decreased by 17%. Up next  Tyson Foods and Palantir Technologies report earnings before US markets open. Also today: NY Fed 3-year inflation expectations are out.  Coming tomorrow: Sysco, Coinbase and Hyatt report earnings. ",Alison Taylor;Carolyn Maloney;Brian Harward;Fassil Michael;George Floyd,Morgan Stanley;Corporate Directors;Corporate Directors;Twitter;Twitter;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Pfizer;Tyson Foods;Stern School Of Business;Hyatt;Johnson Johnson;Mcdonald;Mcdonald;House Committee On Oversight;Governance Solutions,"WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,765;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4598;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,6481;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,765;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,4598;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,6481;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,765;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,4598;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,6481;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,765;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,4598;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,6481;TAX_FNCACT_WARRIORS,5830;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4045;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,4045;ECON_INFLATION,6102;ECON_INFLATION,6561;ECON_INFLATION,6609;ECON_INFLATION,6775;ECON_INFLATION,6937;ECON_INFLATION,7608;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,6102;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,6561;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,6609;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,6775;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,6937;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,7608;WB_442_INFLATION,6102;WB_442_INFLATION,6561;WB_442_INFLATION,6609;WB_442_INFLATION,6775;WB_442_INFLATION,6937;WB_442_INFLATION,7608;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,1943;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1943;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTORS,661;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTORS,728;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTORS,877;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTORS,2693;SCIENCE,4165;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,4165;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,237;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,4057;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,6507;TAX_FNCACT_FOUNDER,1642;WB_2936_GOLD,5646;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,5646;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,5646;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,5646;SECURITY_SERVICES,2291;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2291;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2291;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2001;WB_838_PUBLIC_ACCOUNTABILITY_MECHANISMS,2001;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,4078;TAX_ECON_PRICE,4873;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,438;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,577;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,4078;EDUCATION,4025;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,4025;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,752;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1686;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,4069;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,4585;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1661;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1661;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1661;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,4945;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,4945;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,4945;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,4945;USPEC_POLICY1,3866;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2253;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,7315;GENERAL_HEALTH,7468;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,7468;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,7468;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,7468;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,7468;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,7468;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,7468;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,7468;WB_615_GENDER,1168;TAX_FNCACT_BOARD_MEMBERS,1112;TAX_FNCACT_BOARD_MEMBERS,1138;TAX_FNCACT_BOARD_MEMBERS,1406;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,3379;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,3771;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,3817;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVES,5156;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,5718;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,6019;WB_2670_JOBS,3399;WB_2670_JOBS,3624;WB_2670_JOBS,3662;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,3399;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,3624;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,3662;WB_470_EDUCATION,3399;WB_470_EDUCATION,3624;WB_470_EDUCATION,3662;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,3399;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,3624;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,3662;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,3399;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,3624;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,3662;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1551;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,6119;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,7234;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,6119;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,7234;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,6119;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,7234;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,4654;EPU_ECONOMY,5695;WB_698_TRADE,1348;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,1914;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1648;MEDIA_SOCIAL,6919;MEDIA_SOCIAL,7089;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,521;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,971;TRIAL,4750;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3500;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3537;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3598;TAX_DISEASE_INTRINSIC,5195;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,2310;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,3358;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,3590;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,4784;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,5338;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,5505;",Ukraine;Manhattan;Russia;New York
549,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/world/ohio-rivers-acid-mine-drainage-paint-scn-spc-intl/,"With rolling hills, forests and hiking trails, Southeast Ohio is a haven for lovers of the outdoors. Yet cutting through the landscape are countless orange-stained streams, colored by the iron oxide pollution that has seeped into them from abandoned coal mines. These streams are contaminated with a toxic sludge known as acid mine drainage (AMD) – the overflow of highly acidic wastewater from underground mines, created when water comes into contact with exposed mining rocks.  The UN has described AMD as one of the most severe long-term environmental consequences of mining and it affects coal mining regions around the world, from South Africa to the UK. The pollution can be so toxic to fish and other creatures that it leaves some waterways devoid of aquatic life.  Rivers can be cleaned up by neutralizing the acidity of AMD, but it’s an expensive process. But two professors at Ohio University have come up with a way to fund the clean-up of polluted rivers by extracting the iron oxide – a substance commonly used to make pigments – and turning it into artist-grade paint. “An embarrassment to the population” Coal was once an important part of Ohio’s economy and the state produced approximately 2.35 billion tons from its underground mines between 1800 and 2010. But before 1977, when the US introduced the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act,  mines that were no longer needed were often simply abandoned.  As a result, many of the mines have become polluters, with AMD affecting 1,300 miles of Ohio streams, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.   Guy Riefler, an environmental engineer and Ohio University professor, has been working to tackle the problem for the last 15 years.  “It’s a nuisance and an eyesore and an embarrassment really to the population. And because it’s a poor area, it really doesn’t get the attention it deserves,” Riefler explains.  Riefler landed on the idea of extracting iron oxide from the polluted water and turning it into color pigments, which could be sold to further fund the clean-up of AMD. But he didn’t know enough about paints to determine what made them good quality.  Coincidentally, a decade ago, Ohio University art professor John Sabraw went on a faculty tour of acid mine discharge sites and experimented with making paint from a jar of polluted stream water – without much success.  The pair began working together to turn extracted iron oxide into artist-quality paint. Their collaboration has helped take the idea from “an interesting little science project” to something bigger, as Riefler developed a small-scale process to neutralize the acidity of contaminated streams and extract iron oxide particles – which he says is the predominant metal pollutant in Ohio’s acid mine seeps. “The modern artist is very good at engineering solutions to problems,” he says. “I can’t tell you how many times I got to a roadblock and I bounce it off John … he’d come up with something that I didn’t think of and just took us to the next level.” In 2018, alongside local non-profit Rural Action, they partnered with paint company Gamblin to create a limited run of 500 oil paints. They were offered as a reward for supporters of the Kickstarter campaign that funded their research-scale pilot facility. Named the “Reclaimed Earth Colors” set, the paints were popular amongst artists, says Sabraw, allowing them to incorporate an environmentally conscious aspect in their work.  Through their social enterprise called True Pigments, they are now putting their clean-up model to the test by building their first full-scale treatment facility, due to be operational in 2024. It will be located at the Truetown discharge, at the Sunday Creek Watershed, a site in southeastern Ohio heavily impacted by AMD, according to Riefler.   “Every single minute, 1,000 gallons of water is coming out of this abandoned mine. It’s got a lot of iron and it’s acidic,” says Michelle Shively MacIver, True Pigments’ director of project development. “Very little life can live in an area that looks like this.” Once the treatment facility is operational, True Pigments aims to extract approximately 2 million pounds of iron oxide per year and clean up seven miles of stream – starting from Sunday Creek to the opening of Hocking River – according to MacIver. A previous Rural Action AMD remediation project that neutralized the acidity of stream water on the west branch of Sunday Creek saw 17 species of native fish return after two years, according to the NGO. True Pigments is confident that its facility will lead to a similar outcome in the Sunday Creek watershed. “Our hope is that once the chemistry is fixed there, they (fish) will keep swimming upstream. That will be good for the entire watershed,” MacIver says.  “It’s an expensive issue” True Pigments is not the first to extract iron oxide pigments from pollution. The EnvironOxide range of pigments has been made from AMD in neighboring Pennsylvania for two decades, but Riefler says True Pigments uses a different method that needs less space and is better suited to the conditions at Truetown. True Pigments has received funding from a number of donors including the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), which has granted the project $3.5 million through its Federal Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program. The money will go towards the first phase of constructing the treatment facility.  Ben McCament, abandoned mine land program manager at the ODNR, says that between 1999 and 2018, the department spent approximately $32 million on 67 projects to treat AMD. “It’s an expensive issue,” McCament tells CNN. “I think that’s always been one of the main challenges. Every site is unique, every site is difficult, and it requires long-term funding to treat it.”   By funding True Pigments, the ODNR hopes to illustrate that through a public-private venture, “we can create a product out of these waste streams and then also address an environmental issue and recover and improve water quality that’s been affected by AMD for a long time,” McCament says.  As well as helping the environment, the hope is that the Truetown facility will provide jobs for the local community, and create a supply of iron oxide for other uses – such as the construction industry, where it’s used in bricks, colored concrete and tiles.   McCament believes True Pigments’ model could potentially be a solution for AMD sites around the US, as long as they have “the right conditions that would make this particular approach workable, sustainable and economical.” Riefler echoes this sentiment. “With a little bit more work, it could be adapted to a lot of different places,” he says. “So it’s a first step, and it’s a big one. It’s got promise for pollution around the world.” ",Ben Mccament;Ben Wirtz Siegel;Michelle Shively Maciver;John Sabraw,Ohio University;Ohio University;Ohio University;Ohio Department Of Natural Resources;Ohio Department Of Natural Resources;Cnn,"RURAL,3168;RURAL,4618;TAX_FNCACT_FACULTY,2344;TAX_FNCACT_PILOT,3373;TAX_FNCACT_ARTISTS,3462;SLFID_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1583;SLFID_NATURAL_RESOURCES,5546;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,1583;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,5546;WB_1078_DETERMINANTS_OF_GROWTH,1583;WB_1078_DETERMINANTS_OF_GROWTH,5546;WB_1079_COMMODITIES_AND_RESOURCES,1583;WB_1079_COMMODITIES_AND_RESOURCES,5546;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,3307;TAX_FNCACT_VOLUNTEER,3951;TAX_FNCACT_ENGINEER,1720;ENV_MINING,261;ENV_MINING,419;ENV_MINING,1267;ENV_MINING,1372;ENV_MINING,1462;WB_1698_COAL_MINING,608;AFFECT,1505;TAX_ECON_PRICE,868;TAX_ECON_PRICE,5106;TAX_ECON_PRICE,5933;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,1763;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2314;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,4251;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,5804;TAX_FNCACT_ARTIST,2901;ENV_OIL,3254;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,4457;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,4457;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,4457;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,4457;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,970;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2149;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3650;WB_888_LAND_TENURE,5660;WB_170_AGRICULTURAL_POLICIES,5660;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,5660;WB_994_LAND_RECLAMATION,5660;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1720;WB_2197_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENGINEERING,1720;WATER_SECURITY,2066;UNGP_CLEAN_WATER_SANITATION,2066;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,5969;WB_2670_JOBS,6499;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,6499;WB_470_EDUCATION,6499;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,6499;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,6499;USPEC_POLICY1,1201;EPU_ECONOMY,1201;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1201;TAX_WORLDFISH_FISH,714;TAX_WORLDFISH_FISH,4774;TAX_WORLDFISH_FISH,5000;WB_990_DRAINAGE,343;WB_990_DRAINAGE,1623;WB_990_DRAINAGE,3979;WB_137_WATER,343;WB_137_WATER,1623;WB_137_WATER,3979;WB_151_IRRIGATION_AND_DRAINAGE,343;WB_151_IRRIGATION_AND_DRAINAGE,1623;WB_151_IRRIGATION_AND_DRAINAGE,3979;WB_140_AGRICULTURAL_WATER_MANAGEMENT,343;WB_140_AGRICULTURAL_WATER_MANAGEMENT,1623;WB_140_AGRICULTURAL_WATER_MANAGEMENT,3979;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,911;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1738;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2285;WB_2931_IRON,193;WB_2931_IRON,1012;WB_2931_IRON,2036;WB_2931_IRON,2534;WB_2931_IRON,2783;WB_2931_IRON,4183;WB_2931_IRON,4434;WB_2931_IRON,5161;WB_2931_IRON,6551;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,193;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,1012;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2036;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2534;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2783;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,4183;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,4434;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,5161;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,6551;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,193;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,1012;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,2036;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,2534;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,2783;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,4183;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,4434;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,5161;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,6551;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,193;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,1012;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,2036;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,2534;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,2783;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,4183;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,4434;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,5161;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,6551;SCIENCE,2646;GENERAL_HEALTH,209;GENERAL_HEALTH,690;GENERAL_HEALTH,5191;GENERAL_HEALTH,7075;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,209;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,690;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,5191;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,7075;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,209;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,690;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5191;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,7075;EDUCATION,892;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSORS,892;ENV_COAL,255;ENV_COAL,601;ENV_COAL,1158;ENV_WATERWAYS,762;WB_1805_WATERWAYS,762;WB_135_TRANSPORT,762;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,762;",Pennsylvania;South Africa;Sunday Creek;Hocking River;Ohio;Ohio Department Of Natural Resources;Ohio University;United Kingdom;Truetown;Oreton
673,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/victims-muslim-killings-albuquerque/,"After ambush-style shootings of three Muslim men and the killing of a fourth on Friday in Albuquerque, the Muslim community was on edge and fearful. A well-liked city worker who had aspirations of a future in politics and a proud new US citizen were among the victims of a spree of shootings police say may be related. The killings of Mohammad Ahmadi, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Naeem Hussain have one obvious commonality though: They were all South Asian Muslims, according to Albuquerque police.  The three most recent killings happened within the span of two weeks, with local and national Muslim groups warning residents to remain vigilant. They also put a spotlight on an unsolved homicide from November 2021. On Tuesday, police announced they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, saying they would be charging him with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain. As for the two other killings, police said there is evidence that Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in those as well, Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the city police department’s criminal investigations division said. According to the criminal complaint, Syed denied any involvement in the killings during an interview with police on Tuesday. Here’s what we know about the lives lost. CNN will continue to update this story with more details as we learn them:  Mohammad Zaher Ahmadi, 62  Mohammad Ahmadi was shot and killed outside of a business he and his brother ran together in November 2021, according to CNN affiliate KOAT. Ahmadi was from Afghanistan, police said.  Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27  Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain had been living with his brother, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, in the same apartment complex for almost five years and had never had any problems. The brothers came to the US on student visas, studying at the University of New Mexico, and they would often take early morning or late night walks to the university library without any fear for their safety – until now. On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT. His face was distorted from gunshot wounds, his brother Imtiaz Hussain said. “This is not a random killing,” Hussain said. “This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.” Afzaal Hussain was loved by everyone and a student leader excited for a future in politics once he gained US citizenship.  “We are in extreme fear,” Imtiaz Hussain said. “Living in this place is very painful.” Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor’s degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from Española Mayor John Ramon Vigil.  “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.” Naeem Hussain, 25  Naeem Hussain, 25, had been a US citizen for less than a month when he was found by Albuquerque police officers just before midnight Friday. His brother-in-law Ehsan Shahalami identified Hussian to CNN on Sunday and said he had migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim. “He had a lot of dreams and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.” Hours before his own death, Hussain attended a funeral for two of the recent victims and expressed concern about the shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico. Hussain worked as a truck driver for several years from Albuquerque, a job he took immense pride in, according to Shahalami. “He was not even a citizen at the time but he would say, ‘This is our country, these people need us more than any other time,’ so he drove extra shifts to keep things rolling,” Shahalami said.  After becoming a US citizen, Hussain opened his own trucking business, had plans to bring over his wife from Pakistan and was interested in buying property in Virginia, according to Shahalami. “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient, and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” he said. “He was very hard working.”  Hussain wasn’t just working to support himself – he would share his earnings with family back home, Shahalami said. After the funerals Friday, Gauba said, Hussain attended a lunch at the mosque and approached him asking if he had more information on the shootings. “We (The Islamic Center of New Mexico) thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his (Naeem Hussain) death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear.”   About 700 to 800 Muslims on Fridays attend the Islamic Center of New Mexico, the largest mosque in Albuquerque founded in the mid-1970s, according to Gauba. Aftab Hussein, 41  Aftab Hussein was found with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car on Rhode Island Street on July 26. Detectives learned that a gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle, according to the complaint. He was a Muslim man from Pakistan, police said.

500,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/entertainment/taylor-lautner-twilight-interview/,"When Taylor Lautner started acting in the “Twilight” movies, he was just 16 years old. In order to keep weight on after long days filming and working out, he’d need to consume 5,000 calories a day and would fill up on greasy Carl’s Jr. meals, chasing them with milkshakes. Now, he laughs at the thought of it.  Lautner is 30 years old, engaged, has dogs and lives a quiet life outside Los Angeles. He tells CNN that he likes to pop into the city for a meeting here and there, but that he is happy seeing himself as a regular guy – with just enough Hollywood pull to put it to good use. “I like a little bit of space,” he tells CNN. “I like being able to come into town and do my thing when I want and also be able to get away when we want as well and have some peace and quiet.” Lautner began his acting career at 8 years old, working in commercials, doing voiceovers and eventually landing the role of Shark Boy in “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl” when he was 12.  In 2008, he starred in the first “Twilight” movie and his life changed dramatically, as the franchise’s rabid fans turned him into a teen icon. He says he leaned on his parents to keep him grounded.  “In ‘Twilight,’ I was the youngest – I was 16 – and so my parents were a huge part of (grounding me) and even when I was filming movies, when I was home, I still had to take out the trash. I still had to mow the lawn,” he says. His parents, he joked, would tell him, “We don’t care that you’re on the big screen. You still gotta do your chores.” While he says he’s grateful for the role of shapeshifter Jacob Black in film series – and the paychecks that came with it – he decided to take a step back from Hollywood after starring in all five “Twilight” films.  “My parents definitely just put it into perspective. I think even for them it was uncharted territory for parents that have a 16-year-old going through that,” he says. “It was a learning curve for all of us as a family. And that’s why I think the step back is just a good refresh and just to make sure you’re doing things for the right reasons.”  “I sound like I’m on ‘The Bachelor’ – doing things for ‘the right reasons,’” he laughs, a famous line often cited on the reality dating show, a guilty pleasure of his. He was searching for something meaningful, and that’s when he found love with his now fiancée, a nurse who worked brutal hours helping patients during the pandemic. Lautner’s sister introduced the two when she brought her along to a game night at Lautner’s house. “We’ve been together for four and a half years,” he says. “It’s been amazing. She makes me a better person.” The two live together with their two rescue dogs – Lily, who was his fiancée’s dog before they got together, and Remi, their second dog – and Lautner has thrown himself into animal rescue work. He teamed up with Hill’s Pet Nutrition this year to promote the Clear The Shelters Campaign, which encourages people to adopt from local shelters. “She had Lily already when we met and Lily quickly became my best friend,” Lautner says. “Next thing I know, she sends me a photo of Remi and (tells me) how Remi and her seven siblings and mom were abandoned in a field. Remi just has been a life changing dog for us over the last year.” As for Hollywood, he says he’s reading scripts and producing a few things, but he’s not pressuring himself to work for the sake of it. “I’m reading stuff and what I wanna be doing at this point is I only want to do something if it means something to me,” he says. “Whether that means it’s a story I’m passionate about or if it’s working with somebody that I really want to work with.”",Los Angeles;Taylor Lautner;Shark Boy,Shelters Campaign;Carl Jr;Cnn;Cnn,,Hollywood
323,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/investing/alibaba-earnings-june-quarter-intl-hnk/,"Alibaba just posted flat revenue growth for the first time since becoming a public company, but investors don’t seem to mind. Shares of the Chinese tech and e-commerce giant jumped more than 6% in premarket trading in New York on Thursday. Its stock in Hong Kong had earlier closed up 5.2%. The pop came despite the company reporting revenue of nearly 205.6 billion yuan (about $30.4 billion) in the quarter ended June, roughly in line with what it recorded the same time last year.  But that topped analysts forecasts, and net income was also better than expected, at 22.7 billion yuan ($3.4 billion).  Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA), which owns the hugely popular Taobao and Tmall online shopping platforms, was not immune from the economic pain of Covid-19 lockdowns across China earlier this year. The company said its retail sales slumped in April and May, particularly as Shanghai and other major Chinese cities dealt with crippling pandemic restrictions that scuttled consumer demand and created logistical nightmares. But since June, business has picked back up, particularly “as logistics and the supply chain situation gradually improved after Covid restrictions eased,” said CEO Daniel Zhang. On a conference call Thursday, Zhang said the company had seen glimmers of recovery in categories like fashion and electronics, which were hit hard earlier on. Despite growth virtually skidding to a halt, Zhang sought to put a good spin on the latest results, noting the company had overcome “soft economic conditions” to “deliver stable revenues.” However, he warned of a rocky road ahead, pointing to wider economic risks.  “The external uncertainties, including but not limited to international geopolitical dynamics, Covid resurgence, and China’s macroeconomic policies and social trends, are beyond what we as a company can influence,” Zhang told analysts. “The only things we can do at this moment is to focus on improving ourselves,” he said, adding that Alibaba had focused on narrowing losses across businesses such as its supermarket and food delivery units. But Alibaba has faced bigger questions lately, particularly after its addition to a key US Securities and Exchange Commission watchlist last Friday. Similar to other Chinese firms, the move puts the tech titan at risk of being ejected from Wall Street if US auditors can’t fully inspect its financial statements. Alibaba has long had a primary listing in New York, where its shares have traded since a massive IPO in 2014.  Now, it appears to be spreading its bets. Last week, the company announced plans to upgrade its secondary listing in Hong Kong to a primary listing. The change could take place by the end of this year, and would give more mainland Chinese investors access to the stock. That comes just as one of Alibaba’s biggest longtime backers is seen to be pulling back. The Financial Times reported Thursday that SoftBank\n            \n                (SFTBF) had “sold more than half” of its holdings in the Chinese company, citing filings of forward sales seen by the newspaper.

388,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/entertainment/john-leguizamo-james-franco-castro-casting-cec/,"James Franco has reportedly been cast as Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro, and many Latino actors aren’t happy. Most notably, the prolific John Leguizamo, who recently voiced Bruno in Disney’s “Encanto,” blasted Franco’s casting on Instagram. Leguizamo argued that the role should have gone to a Latino actor instead.  “How is this still going on?” Leguizamo asked on Friday. “How is Hollywood excluding us but stealing our narratives as well? No more appropriation Hollywood and streamers! Boycott! This F’d up! Plus seriously difficult story to tell without aggrandizement, which would (be) wrong! I don’t got a (problem) with Franco but he ain’t Latino!”  Franco is set to star as Castro in the upcoming “Alina of Cuba,” with production set to start later this year, per reports. The movie follows the life of Alina Fernandez, Castro’s daughter. Leguizamo isn’t the only Latino star angered by the casting.  “Wtf is this….” wrote actress Jess Darrow, who voiced Luisa Madrigal in “Encanto,” in response to Leguizamo’s post. “I’m sorry but what in the actual f**k?” wrote actor Raúl Castillo in an Instagram story. “Not me reading that James Franco will have to ‘build’ an accent for Castro, when my entire life I’ve been made fun of for not speaking English like an American and been told countless times to work hard to get rid of it…” wrote actress Sol Rodriguez.  “I’m auditioning for another generic Latin-American drug dealer and James Franco is dead a** playing Fidel Castro,” wrote actor Jeff Torres on Twitter. “Latinos gettin’ done dirty af out here and everywhere. Damn lol.” Latino representation has long lagged in Hollywood. Despite making up 18% of the US population, only 5% of the speaking roles in 2019’s top 100 movies went to Latino actors, according to a 2020 study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.  Franco also faced allegations of inappropriate and sexually exploitive behavior in 2018 from five women, several of whom were his students. In 2021, in the wake of settling a class-action lawsuit, he admitted to sleeping with students from the acting school he co-owned.

49,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/us-saudi-uae-proposed-arms-deal/,"The Biden administration on Tuesday approved and notified Congress of possible multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  The notice of the approval comes just weeks after President Joe Biden met with the leaders of each nation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as he sought to improve relations between the US and the Saudis.  The approval was also notified on the same day that the United Nations announced a two-month extension of the truce in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebel group had, until recent months, been engaged in a years-long bloody conflict that has killed thousands of civilians. According to a news release from the US State Department, the agency approved a possible sale of PATRIOT MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical Ballistic Missiles (GEM-T) and related equipment to Saudi Araba for an estimated $3.05 billion. “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Gulf region,” the State Department said of the sale.  “The proposed sale will improve the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet current and future threats by replenishing its dwindling stock of PATRIOT GEM-T missiles,” it said. “These missiles are used to defend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s borders against persistent Houthi cross-border unmanned aerial system and ballistic missile attacks on civilian sites and critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia.” “These attacks threaten the well-being of Saudi, International, and U.S. citizens (approximately 70,000) residing in the Kingdom. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces,” it added. Separately, the State Department approved the possible sale of “Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) System Missiles, THAAD Fire Control and Communication Stations, and related equipment for an estimated cost of $2.245 billion” to the UAE. “This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of an important regional partner. The UAE is a vital U.S. partner for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,” the State Department said. “The proposed sale will improve the UAE’s ability to meet current and future ballistic missile threats in the region, and reduce dependence on U.S. forces.” Shortly after taking office, Biden announced the US would end its support for Saudi’s offensive operations in Yemen, “including relevant arms sales.” However, the administration has continued to sell arms to the kingdom for what it says are defensive purposes.

264,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/jackie-walorski-died-indiana-republican/,"Indiana Republican Rep. Jackie Walorski has died in a car accident that also killed two of Walorski’s staffers, House Republican leaders announced Wednesday. The news came as a major shock on Capitol Hill and immediately sparked an outpouring of grief and remembrances from lawmakers and aides who paid tribute to the lives and careers of the congresswoman and the two staffers.  Walorski, who was 58, represented Indiana’s 2nd Congressional District and had previously served as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives. She began serving in Congress in 2013. The congresswoman was viewed inside the House Republican conference as someone who could one day ascend to the ranks of GOP leadership, and her name had been batted around for the position of conference chairwoman in the past. She had been a member of the House GOP’s deputy whip team. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced Walorski’s death. “Dean Swihart, Jackie’s husband, was just informed by Elkhart County Sheriff’s office that Jackie was killed in a car accident this afternoon. She has returned home to be with her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Please keep her family in your thoughts and prayers. We will have no further comment at this time,” read a message from the congresswoman’s office that McCarthy tweeted. A statement released by the congresswoman’s office said that two staffers had also died. “In addition to the devastating loss of Congresswoman Walorski, it is with a broken heart that I announce the passing of two dedicated members of her staff, Zach Potts and Emma Thomson. They were the epitome of public servants who cared deeply about the work they performed,” said the statement from Tim Cummings, the congresswoman’s chief of staff.  McCarthy called the congresswoman’s passing “absolutely devastating” in a lengthy statement released later on Wednesday. “Jackie was a dear friend, trusted advisor, and the embodiment of integrity who achieved the admiration and respect of all her colleagues in the House,” he said.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered flags at the Capitol to be flown at half-staff in response to the death of the congresswoman, Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill announced Wednesday afternoon.  In a statement, Pelosi said the congresswoman “lived a life of service” and “was admired by colleagues on both sides of the aisle for her personal kindness.”  House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said in a statement that Walorski “was a champion for the people of Indiana, and she will be remembered for her kindness, tenacity, and commitment to helping others.”  The congresswoman served as the top Republican on the House Ethics Committee, a spot that put her in line to become chair of the panel if the GOP retakes the House majority in the upcoming midterm elections. She also served as the ranking GOP member for a subcommittee of the powerful House Ways and Means committee. GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming tweeted in reaction to the news, “There was no more dedicated or effective member of Congress than Jackie,” adding, “I was proud to be her friend.”   Walorski died in a vehicle crash, according to a statement from the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office provided an update on Thursday to say that eyewitness accounts and video show a silver Toyota Rav 4 traveling northbound, and driven by Potts, 27, crossed the centerline.  “The Toyota RAV 4 crossed the centerline for reasons that are unknown at this time and the two vehicles collided,” ECSO said in the updated release. The driver of the other car, 56-year-old Edith Schmucker, also died as a result of the crash.

39,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/walker-warnock-georgia-debate/,"Herschel Walker, the Republican Senate nominee from Georgia, said this week that he has accepted an invitation to debate his Democratic rival, Sen. Raphael Warnock, in October. Speaking to Fox’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday night, Walker said he has agreed to a televised debate in Savannah, Warnock’s hometown. Notably, that event is not one of the three debates Warnock has said he has agreed to attend. “I have accepted a debate in Savannah, Georgia, in his backyard, that we can debate October the 14th, in front of a crowd, that it’ll be his people, because we’re in his backyard,” Walker said. “This debate is going to be about the people. It’s not about some political party. It’s not about the press.” The Walker campaign told CNN the proposed event would be sponsored by local TV station WSAV and broadcast on other stations in markets across Georgia. Mallory Blount, a campaign spokeswoman, did not respond to questions about whether Walker would agree to any other debates. The Warnock campaign, meanwhile, did not directly respond to whether the Democratic incumbent would attend the WSAV debate. “Two months ago, Reverend Warnock accepted invitations to three well-established Georgia debates in Atlanta, Savannah, and Macon to be broadcast statewide, after Herschel Walker said he would debate Reverend Warnock anywhere, anytime,” said Quentin Fulks, Warnock’s campaign manager. “Nothing has changed. Reverend Warnock remains committed to debating Herschel Walker and giving Georgians three opportunities to see the clear choice about who is ready to represent Georgia.” Walker has faced increasing pressure in recent weeks to agree to debate his opponent, including ads from Warnock’s campaign accusing the Republican of “dodging” three debates. The pressure on Walker has come not just from Warnock. Fox’s Brian Kilmeade asked the GOP nominee last week why he had not committed to debating Warnock. “Sen. Warnock has nothing else to talk about,” Walker said. “I’m ready to debate him, any time, any day. I just want to make it for the fans, not about a political party or about some media, and all he’s doing is talking. I want to make it a fair and equitable debate for the people.” The Georgia Senate race is one of the most high-profile elections of the upcoming midterms, and the state remains sharply divided. Democrats like Warnock and President Joe Biden won statewide in the last cycle after years of GOP dominance, but the governor’s mansion and state legislature are still controlled by Republicans. A recent Fox News poll of registered voters found Warnock with 46% support to Walker’s 42%, while the same survey put Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp at 47% against Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams at 44%. Republicans in Georgia – many of whom have expressed concern over Walker’s liabilities as a candidate – say the first-time candidate would be better served by not facing Warnock in a public debate format. Walker easily won his May 24 primary without having to debate any of his GOP opponents.",Brian Kemp;Quentin Fulks;Fox Sean Hannity;Joe Biden;Raphael Warnock;Mallory Blount;Herschel Walker;Herschel Walker;Herschel Walker;Fox Brian Kilmeade;Stacey Abrams,Republican Senate;Georgia Senate;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2512;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2737;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,2820;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,2848;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,1408;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,674;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,2083;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,2448;TAX_FNCACT_REVEREND,1140;TAX_FNCACT_REVEREND,1333;TAX_FNCACT_REVEREND,1439;ELECTION,2261;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,810;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1269;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,810;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1269;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,810;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1269;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,52;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,1861;TAX_ETHNICITY_GEORGIANS,1512;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_GEORGIANS,1512;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2335;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2324;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,37;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1741;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2639;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,37;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1741;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2639;MEDIA_MSM,785;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2784;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,20;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,242;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,595;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,717;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,947;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,1303;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,1493;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,1601;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,1788;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,1972;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,2597;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,2793;TAX_FNCACT_WALKER,2927;LEADER,2360;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2360;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESWOMAN,895;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENT,1079;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENT,2649;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,203;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,1824;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,2526;",Georgia;Atlanta;Georgians
619,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/new-york-migrants-buses-texas/,"New York Mayor Eric Adams has claimed that some migrants are being “forced” on buses from Texas, as 14 more asylum seekers arrived in the city Sunday on another bus sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.  Fifty-four asylum seekers arrived in New York Friday on board a bus from Texas, according to the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs. Abbott’s office indicated that New York is now a designated “drop-off location for the busing strategy as part of the governor’s response to the Biden administration’s open border policies overwhelming Texas communities,” according to a statement released Friday announcing the arrival of the first bus. “It’s unimaginable, what the governor in Texas has done,” Adams told reporters Sunday. “When you think about this country, a country that has always been open to those who were fleeing persecution and other intolerable conditions, we’ve always welcomed that. And this governor is not doing that in Texas, but we are going to set the right message, the right tone, of being here for these families.” On Monday, Adams called it a “mean and cruel thing.” Abbott claimed in a statement Monday, though, that the asylum seekers freely chose to go to New York, “having signed a voluntary consent waiver, available in multiple languages, upon boarding that they agreed on the destination.” “What’s horrific is the thousands of illegal immigrants overrunning and overwhelming our border communities with populations smaller than a New York City borough, and Mayor Adams is hypocritically upset about welcoming a few dozen into his sanctuary city,” Abbott said. “If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis, he should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border—something the President continues failing to do.”  A fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies, Abbott began sending hundreds of willing migrants on buses to Washington, DC, earlier this year as an affront to the administration. Abbott’s office has said that “to board a bus or flight, a migrant must volunteer to be transported and show documentation from DHS.” More than 5,100 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 135 buses, according to the governor’s office.  “In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,” Abbott said Friday. His state has been busing people to Washington, DC and New York City “to provide relief to our local partners,” Abbott said in the statement. Manuel Castro, commissioner of the mayor’s immigrant affairs office, told CNN New York is a right-to-shelter city, so anyone who needs shelter may receive it. However, the city has “exhausted” its regular shelter space, so it has leased additional space at hotels, he said. “These are families, these are people,” Castro said. “They have a right to be here as asylum-seekers and New York is here to welcome them. They frankly need a lot of support. They’ve traveled a long way to get here.” Adams repeated Monday he hoped to be in touch directly with the White House about federal assistance on the matter.  “Right now, we are at a state where we must get to the assistance from the federal government,” Adams said.  The Biden administration has “been in regular contact with Mayor Adams,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said, and the administration is “committed to working with them as we do effectively with other local leaders through FEMA funding and other support.”  “As we have always said, there is a process in place for managing migration flows, and Republicans governors should stop meddling in that process and using desperate migrants as political tools,” Hasan said.  Some migrants did not want to come to New York, mayor says Around 40 people were expected to arrive Sunday, Adams said, adding that it is not known if others got off the bus before it arrived in New York. Some of the migrants who did arrive Sunday told the mayor they had relatives in other cities and did not plan to come to New York.  Some families “wanted to go to other locations and they were not allowed to do so,” Adams said Sunday. “They were forced on the bus with the understanding that they were going to other locations that they wanted to go to, and when they tried to explain, they were not allowed to do so.” Families whose desired destination was not New York said it took three days to get to the city from Texas, according to Castro, who also met with them, noting many “were hungry and thirsty, with small children.”  Adams issued an emergency declaration last week to “rapidly procure shelter and other services” for people seeking asylum in the city. Those who want to stay in New York will go to shelters, and volunteer groups will be helping “those who want to go somewhere else” to travel to another location, the mayor said. New York Taxi Workers Alliance executive director Bhairavi Desai told CNN they had 19 yellow cabs and Uber cars ready to voluntarily transport refugees arriving from Texas from the bus stop to shelters or to homes of friends or family in the area Sunday morning. “Everyone we saw looked exhausted by the journey. Many people looked relieved to finally reach safety but there were also people crying from the trauma,” Desai said. “It’s wrong, and in our melting pot city, it won’t work,” Desai added. “We wanted to do our part to let new neighbors know that they’re welcome here, and in NYC there are people who will help.”  Around 4,000 asylum seekers have entered the New York City shelter system since late May, according to Adams, who said the influx is the primary driver of around a 10% increase in the city’s Department of Homeless Services’ census. New York’s shelter system is currently receiving more than 100 asylum seekers looking for some form of housing per day, on average, according to the homeless service’s department. CNN has asked the mayor’s office for the total number of migrants the city is processing from Texas. Generally, once migrants are processed by federal authorities and released from custody, they are allowed to move throughout the country while they go through immigration court proceedings. They are often released in Texas and other border states, and then continue on journeys to other parts of the country. An immigration judge will ultimately decide if they are allowed to remain in the US or be deported.

192,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/asia/taiwan-china-airspace-pelosi-trip-explainer-intl-hnk/,"China is conducting military drills around Taiwan to protest a visit to the island this week by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. China issued a map showing six zones around Taiwan that would be the site of air and sea exercises, and long-range live-fire drills in coming days – part of what a spokesman described as a “blockade.” Ships and aircraft have been warned to stay out of the areas during the drills. On Thursday, Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau said China had added a seventh military exercise area for ships and aircraft to avoid “in the waters around eastern Taiwan.” The exercise areas announced by Beijing extend well into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone –  a buffer of airspace commonly referred to as an ADIZ – and in some cases come within 12 nautical miles (22.2 kilometers) of its shores. Twelve nautical miles is the distance that international law defines as constituting a country’s territorial airspace.  Analysts say it’s an extremely provocative move. Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center, said China is going “a lot farther than it ever has before” in putting its military assets close to Taiwan’s shores. Beijing’s threats have prompted much discussion over what, exactly, constitutes Taiwan’s airspace, and if it’s recognized under international law.  Here’s what you need to know. What is a country’s airspace? Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a country’s territorial boundaries extend 12 nautical miles (22.2 kilometers) from its coastline.  The area above is considered the country’s territorial airspace, according to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which also stipulates that government or military aircraft may not fly over the territory of another country without permission. China is a signatory to UNCLOS, signing on December 10, 1982, and ratifying it in 1996. Taiwan is not.   If Taiwan isn’t an independent country, does it have its own airspace? Taiwan’s disputed status makes this question hard to answer definitively.  While Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, mainland China insists it has sovereignty over the island and is fiercely opposed to any suggestion that it could be considered an independent country.  Most countries in the world do not recognize Taiwan as an independent country – holding diplomatic relations with Beijing rather than Taipei. However, Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and a former US Defense Department official, said most of the world treated Taiwan as if it were an independent country – and for that reason, it should be considered as having its own airspace. “The reality is Taiwan exists. Taiwan is autonomous. It is effectively independent of any other country. It elects its own government, collects its own taxes, defends its own borders. So for all intents and purposes, Taiwan is a country,” Thompson said.  “Under that principle, then perhaps we decide that international law applies, in which case Taiwan’s airspace extends to 12 miles beyond its baseline. Beyond the 12-mile limit is international waters, international airspace,” he added. Thompson said there was also a matter of precedent and that even China’s military appeared to tacitly recognize this. Despite the “fact that the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) doesn’t recognize Taiwan, or China doesn’t recognize Taiwan, they’ve respected Taiwan’s airspace,” he said. Chinese commercial aviation companies also respected Taiwan’s airspace, Thompson said, recognizing a “convention that effectively treats Taiwan as independent under civil aviation guidelines.” However, China contends that since Taiwan is its sovereign territory, its military aircraft do not need permission from Taiwan or any other entity to fly into the island’s territorial airspace. In Beijing’s eyes, Taiwan’s airspace is essentially China’s airspace. So could China fly its military planes over Taiwan? “It would run against international law, but international law is flimsy and open to the interpretation of every country that decides whether or not they want to follow it or enforce it,” Thompson said. But what is “international law?” The International Court of Justice in the Hague, says it evaluates cases based on “international conventions,” such as treaties like UNCLOS; “international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law,” in other words, what countries usually do in a given circumstance; and “the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.” The United Nations’ website says international law is upheld “in many ways – by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties – and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary.” But remember, the five permanent members of the Security Council, including both China and the United States, have veto power, so they can block any UN attempt to enforce international law. “You’ve seen China disregard international law norms left and right for decades, not least in the South China Sea,” Thompson said, referring to the military facilities China has built on various islands despite having its claims to sovereignty rejected by an international tribunal in 2016. What’s the difference between airspace and an air defense identification zone? Taiwan has often been in the headlines recently when Chinese warplanes have entered its air defense identification zone. On Tuesday, for example, Taiwan said 21 Chinese planes entered its ADIZ, and there have been almost daily incursions of PLA warplanes for the past month. However, these zones are not the same as territorial airspace. Rather, they are unilaterally declared buffer areas that extend beyond territorial airspace, that are specifically set up to give defensive forces time to react when foreign aircraft approach. Consequently, not all countries have an air defense identification zone. The US Federal Aviation Administration defines the zones as “a designated area of airspace over land or water within which a country requires the immediate and positive identification, location and air traffic control of aircraft in the interest of the country’s national security.” Mercedes Trent of the Federation of American Scientists wrote in a 2020 review that, “It is customary for foreign aircraft entering such zones to identify themselves and seek prior authorization from the country controlling the zone before entering.”  If foreign aircraft do enter an air defense identification zone without permission, the home jurisdiction will often scramble fighter aircraft to warn off the intruders. This has happened on numerous occasions when Chinese warplanes have entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in recent years. How did Taiwan set up its air defense identification zone? The island’s air defense identification zone was actually the brainchild of the United States, which set up similar zones for Japan, South Korea and the Philippines to try to protect them from Chinese and Russian overflights, according to Trent, of the Federation of American Scientists. Part of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone actually extends over the Chinese mainland, but Chinese flights are challenged by Taiwan only if they cross the median line – the halfway point between the island and the mainland above the Taiwan Strait. Does China have an air defense identification zone? Yes. It is over the East China Sea and covers the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu island chain, which is controlled by Japan. China’s air defense identification zone overlaps those of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. However, it does not cover the island of Taiwan itself, stopping just short of its northern tip.",Carl Schuster;Mercedes Trent;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi,Us Navy;Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public;Us

6,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/business/us-bank-cfbp-fine/,"The fifth-largest commercial bank in the US was fined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for illegally accessing consumer credit reports and opening accounts without their permission. U.S. Bank, which is based in Minneapolis and has over $559 billion in assets, pressured its employees to meet sales goals as part of their job requirements, offering them incentives for selling bank products, the regulator said. In order to meet those goals, the bank’s employees illegally accessed customer credit reports and personal data to open accounts without permission, the investigation found.  The CFBP announced Thursday that it fined U.S. Bank $37.5 million, after a five-year investigation. “For over a decade, U.S. Bank knew its employees were taking advantage of its customers by misappropriating consumer data to create fictitious accounts,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a press release. In a statement to CNN Business, U.S. Bank said it has “made process and oversight improvements” since 2016 regarding sales practice concerns. Employees now receive incentives only for accounts where the customer uses the service.                                                                                                                                     The settlement is “related to legacy sales practices involving a small percentage of accounts dating back to 2010,” U.S. Bank said in a statement Saturday. “We are pleased to put this matter behind us.” U.S. Bank has over 2,800 branches throughout the United States.  The CFBP said its investigation found evidence that the bank was aware that its employees were opening accounts without customers’ authorization, and did not have measures in place to prevent and detect them. The bank’s sales campaigns and compensation programs rewarded employees for selling bank products, the agency added  Regulators found that the employees opened deposit accounts, credit cards and lines of credit that carried high interest rates and expensive fees that were passed on to the customer.  “U.S. Bank’s conduct harmed its customers in the form of unwanted accounts, negative effects on their credit profiles, and the loss of control over personally identifiable information,” the CFBP said in its release, saying customers were forced to close the unauthorized accounts in their names and seek refunds themselves.

465,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/entertainment/judith-durham-the-seekers-singer-death/,"Judith Durham, an Australian folk music star and lead singer of The Seekers, has died, according to a statement from her record label. She was 79. “After a brief stay in the Alfred Hospital, Judith was admitted to Palliative Care on Friday 5 August, where she passed away peacefully that evening. Her death was a result of complications from a long-standing chronic lung disease,” Musicoast and Universal Music Australia said in a statement shared on the verified Facebook page for The Seekers. “Our lives are changed forever losing our treasured lifelong friend and shining star. Her struggle was intense and heroic – never complaining of her destiny and fully accepting its conclusion. Her magnificent musical legacy Keith, Bruce and I are so blessed to share,” her former bandmates Keith Potger, Bruce Woodley and Athol Guy added in the post.  Durham helped open the door for Australian artists to achieve international fame. The Seekers, formed in 1962, were considered the first Australian pop band to achieve mainstream success in the United Kingdom and the United States. The group’s hits included “Georgy Girl” and “A World of Our Own.” Durham left The Seekers to pursue a solo career in 1968 and released several solo albums but continued to reunite and tour with the band in the decades after. Several prominent Australians posted tributes Saturday. “A national treasure and an Australian icon, Judith Durham gave voice to a new strand of our identity and helped blaze a trail for a new generation of Aussie artists,” wrote Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Twitter. “Her kindness will be missed by many, the anthems she gave to our nation will never be forgotten.” Australian comedian and actress Magda Szubanski shared her “deepest condolences to her loved ones” on Twitter. “Her beautiful, crystalline voice was the naive but knowing siren song of my childhood,” wrote Szubanski. Tanya Plibersek, Australian Minister for the Environment and Water, called Durham “a trailblazer and an icon in Australian music” on Twitter. “Her songs will live on forever.”",Bruce Woodley;Athol Guy;Magda Szubanski;Judith Durham;Judith Durham;Tanya Plibersek;Keith Potger,Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Facebook;Cnn;United States,"TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,379;WB_1406_DISEASES,379;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,379;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIANS,1321;LEADER,1545;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,1545;WB_2670_JOBS,1187;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1187;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,1187;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,1187;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,1187;TAX_FNCACT_ARTISTS,888;TAX_FNCACT_ARTISTS,1511;GENERAL_HEALTH,196;MEDICAL,196;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,196;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,196;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,308;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,34;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,880;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,984;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1385;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1530;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1686;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1919;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,2010;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,64;WB_1305_HEALTH_SERVICES_DELIVERY,237;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,237;WB_1308_PALLIATIVE_CARE,237;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1545;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1928;MEDIA_SOCIAL,471;AFFECT,1433;TAX_FNCACT_COMEDIAN,1695;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,1705;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1948;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1770;",Australians;Australia;Australian;United States;Aussie;United Kingdom
231,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/business/taco-bell-mexican-pizza/,"Taco Bell can thank Mexican Pizza for a boost in sales last quarter. Sales at US Taco Bell stores open at least a year jumped 8% in the three months ending June 30. In that period, Taco Bell sold more than 20 million Mexican Pizzas across the country and saw loyalty membership grow 10%, driven largely by customers’ desire for early access to the product.  For Taco Bell, the frenzy around Mexican Pizza was important because of the attention it brought to the chain.  “The benefit of things like the Mexican pizza is the connection it has with consumers … and the halo it provides to the brand,” said David Gibbs, CEO of Taco Bell’s parent company Yum Brands\n            \n                (YUM), during an analyst call Wednesday. “It’s just as much about the buzz … and the relevance it creates for our brand as it is about the discrete amount of sales.” Taco Bell removed the beloved item — pizza sauce with ground beef or beans sandwiched between two crispy tortillas — in November 2020 when it slimmed down its menu to simplify operations during the pandemic. Mexican Pizza came back for a limited time in May, but the item quickly sold out. Some locations ran out within a week, said Gibbs. Taco Bell plans to bring the item back to menus permanently in the fall. At that point, “we will get actual discrete sales benefit that might translate into a couple of points,” said Gibbs.  Buzz is essential to fast food companies, which have to battle for notoriously fickle customers who don’t have much brand loyalty. Excitement around an item can inspire customers to go to, say, Taco Bell instead of to one of its competitors.                                                                           And when an item really hits, it can make a huge difference. Consider Popeyes’ spicy chicken sandwich. The much-hyped item sold out within two weeks of arriving on menus. After Popeyes brought it back, it drove sales for the brand.  Setting yourself apart with distinct products or promotions is especially important now, as some customers pull backs spending because of inflation, noted Gibbs.  “The formula to win in any environment for us is to have a lot of brand buzz, to have product news and to have great value,” he said. Mexican Pizza, in addition to cheaper options like $2 burritos, “added up to a blowout quarter for Taco Bell.”   Other Yum brands didn’t fare as well, however. KFC’s same-store US sales fell 7% in the quarter, and Pizza Hut’s fell 4%. — CNN Business’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.

199,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/breonna-taylor-federal-charges/,"Four current and former Louisville police officers involved in the deadly raid on Breonna Taylor’s home – including detectives who worked on the search warrant and the ex-officer accused of firing blindly into her home – have been charged with civil rights violations and other counts, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday.  The charges mark the first federal counts leveled against any of the officers involved in the botched raid. In addition to civil rights offenses, federal authorities charged the four with unlawful conspiracies, unconstitutional use of force and obstruction, Garland said.  Taylor’s mom, Tamika Palmer, said she’s waited 874 days for federal charges to be filed and has beaten “everything sent to break” her. Her daughter’s death has taken her to a “place that we can’t even imagine,” she said.  “Every day’s been March 13 for me,” Palmer said, referring to the day Taylor was killed in 2020.   Former Detective Joshua Jaynes, 40, Detective Kelly Goodlett and Sgt. Kyle Meany, 35, were charged with submitting a false affidavit to search Taylor’s home ahead of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department’s raid, and then working together to create a “false cover story in an attempt to escape responsibility for their roles in preparing the warrant affidavit that contained false information,” according to court documents.  Ex-detective Brett Hankison is alleged to have “willfully used unconstitutionally excessive force … when he fired his service weapon into Taylor’s apartment through a covered window and covered glass door.” He is charged with depriving Taylor and a guest in her home “of their constitutional rights by firing shots through a bedroom window that was covered with blinds and a blackout curtain,” the US Department of Justice said.  The 46-year-old also faces charges of depriving three of Taylor’s neighbors of their constitutional rights as, according to the indictment, the bullets he fired traveled through a wall in Taylor’s home and into an adjacent apartment.  Jaynes and Meany stand accused of willfully depriving Taylor of her constitutional rights by drafting and approving a false affidavit to obtain a search warrant, while knowing “the affidavit contained false and misleading statements, omitted material facts, relied on stale information, and was not supported by probable cause,” the DOJ statement said. Both men “knew that the execution of the search warrant would be carried out by armed LMPD officers, and could create a dangerous situation both for those officers and for anyone who happened to be in Taylor’s home,” it said.  Goodlett conspired with Jaynes and Meany to “falsify the search warrant for Taylor’s home and to cover up their actions afterward,” the statement said.  Jaynes and another detective tried to cover up their actions by drafting a bogus investigative letter and making false statements to investigators, according to the statement. Jaynes falsified a report in hopes of impeding a criminal probe into Taylor’s death; Meany also made false statements, the statement said.  Goodlett and Jaynes met in a garage weeks after the botched raid and conspired to relay false information to investigators, the attorney general alleged.  “We allege that Ms. Taylor’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated when defendants Joshua Jaynes, Kyle Meany and Kelly Goodlett sought a warrant to search Ms. Taylor’s home knowing the officers lacked probable cause for the search,” Garland said.  The affidavit falsely claimed officers had verified that the target of their drug trafficking investigation had received packages at Taylor’s address, but Jaynes and Goodlett knew that was not true, Garland said.  Jaynes, appearing virtually from a detention facility wearing shorts and a polo shirt, entered a not guilty plea. Prosecutors are not requesting that he be detained pending trial, but they ask that he be prohibited from contacting any possible witnesses or defendants in the case. Hankison, who fired 10 shots into Taylor’s home and was acquitted on state wanton endangerment charges earlier this year, was indicted on two federal counts of deprivation of rights under color of law. Hankison’s attorney declined to comment. Only Hankison was charged at the state level. Officers who carried out the search warrant were not involved in the drafting of the warrant and were unaware it contained false information, the attorney general said. “We share but we cannot fully imagine the grief felt by Breonna Taylor’s loved ones and all of those affected by the events of March 13, 2020,” Garland said. “Breonna Taylor should be alive today.” A conviction on the charge of willfully violating someone’s rights carries a statutory maximum sentence of life in prison when the violation leads to death, according to the DOJ. A conviction on an obstruction count commands a maximum penalty of 20 years, and the conspiracy and false statement charges each carry maximum sentences of five years, the department says.  Attorney: ‘Huge step toward justice’ Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Taylor’s family, applauded the charges, as well the “tough fight” waged by Taylor’s family, attorneys, advocates and community members. In 2020, Crump and his team secured a settlement that paid Taylor’s family $12 million and led to sweeping police reforms, including the use of social workers to provide support on certain police runs and the requirement that commanders review and approve search warrants before seeking judicial approval. “Today was a huge step toward justice. We are grateful for the diligence and dedication of the FBI and the DOJ as they investigated what led to Breonna’s murder and what transpired afterwards. The justice that Breonna received today would not have been possible without the efforts of Attorney General Merrick Garland or Assistant AG for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke,” Crump said in a statement. “We hope this announcement of a guilty plea sends a message to all other involved officers that it is time to stop covering up and time to accept responsibility for their roles in causing the death of an innocent, beautiful young Black woman.” Clarke said in a statement, “Since the founding of our nation, the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution has guaranteed that all people have a right to be secure in their homes, free from false warrants, unreasonable searches and the use of unjustifiable and excessive force by the police. These indictments reflect the Justice Department’s commitment to preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system and to protecting the constitutional rights of every American.” In January 2021, the LMPD terminated Jaynes and his colleague Myles Cosgrove. Cosgrove was fired for his use of deadly force in unleashing 16 rounds into Taylor’s home and failing to activate his body camera, according to a copy of his termination letter. Jaynes was fired for “failing to complete a Search Warrant Operations Plan form” and being untruthful about verifying that Taylor’s previous boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, had been receiving packages at Taylor’s home, the termination letter said.  Following his termination, Jaynes’ attorney, Thomas Clay, said the move was not unexpected and promised to fight to have his client reinstated.  “It’s our position that he did nothing wrong in any of the activities relating to this search,” Clay told CNN in January 2021.  Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said, adding that the shooting was justified because Taylor’s boyfriend fired at officers first. Kenneth Walker II, Taylor’s boyfriend, has repeatedly said he thought the officers were intruders and fired one shot when they broke down the door. Crump co-counsel Lonita Baker took aim at Cameron following Garland’s announcement Thursday, saying the attorney general “has no right holding any political offices” representing Kentucky.  “The federal government had the guts to do what Daniel Cameron did not,” she said.  A review board upheld Cosgrove’s termination last year, and Jaynes lost a similar appeal before the board in June, according to CNN affiliate WDRB.  The Louisville police union said at the time the firings were “unjustified.” “There is certainly no evidence in this case that policies and procedures of the LMPD were violated to the extent that warranted termination,” the River City Fraternal Order of Police said in a statement. “Interim Chief (Yvette) Gentry not only made the wrong decision, but also sent an ominous message to every sworn officer of the Louisville Metro Police Department.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was shot and killed in her apartment during a flawed forced-entry raid in the early hours of March 13, 2020. Her death, along with that of other Black people at the hands of law enforcement – including George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia – sparked a summer of protests calling for police reform. No officer who took part in the raid has previously been charged for Taylor’s actual killing. State prosecutors charged only Hankison in connection with the shooting. The LMPD fired Hankison in June 2020, and in September 2020, a grand jury charged Hankison with three counts of felony wanton endangerment for blindly firing 10 shots into Taylor’s home.  A jury acquitted Hankison on all charges in March.

527,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/economy/gas-prices-falling-inflation/,"Gas prices have been trending downward for more than 50 consecutive days, giving drivers some much-needed financial relief at the pump. But nobody’s popping the champagne just yet. While gas prices have played a large role in the current bout of historic inflation, analysts warn that a number of factors remain that will keep overall prices from falling any time soon.  Oil outlook remains murky Prices at the pump might be lower now – the average cost of a gallon of gas is down almost a dollar since the June peak – but the longer-term outlook for oil suggests low inventories that will keep prices elevated. “Russia-Ukraine is a factor but… we had tight supplies coming into this,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “We’d love to see the conflict in Russia and Ukraine end. But I think we still are faced with a global economy that is short of oil in the near term.” Aside from Russia’s war with Ukraine and the sanctions that have disrupted its oil exports, the unwillingness – or inability, according to some oil analysts – of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to significantly increase production is limiting how much additional oil is coming onto global markets. The oil group and its partners, known as OPEC+, last week announced a small output increase of 100,000 barrels a day for September, less than the market had expected. One other factor is the hesitancy of US producers to sink big money into extracting and – more critically – refining fossil fuels when long-term policy goals suggest diminishing returns in the face of a shift to renewable energy.  “There is a structural problem with the oil and gas industry and that has to do with refining capability,” said Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at ETF company GraniteShares. “Oil companies, not just in the United States but globally, have not expanded refining capacity. That continues to pressure gas prices.” Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at investment firm Third Bridge, said there was “misunderstood criticism” of refiners’ swelling profits, pointing to investments being made to convert existing refining facilities to process biofuels. “These companies are investing for the energy transition,” he said. Housing keeps getting pricier  Housing is a big part of the average family’s budget, and it’s also a big part of the basket of goods and services the government uses to calculate inflation. The way the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the cost of housing makes it a highly influential piece of the Consumer Price Index. Shelter costs include owners’ equivalent rent and rent of primary residence, which captures how much both homeowners and renters pay to live in their homes. Shelter comprises about a third of the overall CPI, and makes up around 40% of core CPI, which excludes prices for food and energy.  “What is important is housing,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “While we have been seeing new and existing home sales start to decline, prices have not been coming down because there’s still more demand than there is supply.”  Existing home prices hit a new record high of $416,000 in June, up 13.4% from a year ago. A February report from Realtor.com found that at the median, renters earning the typical household income for their area are paying nearly 30% of their income on rent, a threshold policymakers consider “rent-burdened.” Also, the double whammy of higher prices and elevated mortgage rates continues to push homeownership out of reach for many, with more and more families forced onto the sidelines as the impact of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes pushes up the cost of purchasing a home. “Prices for housing will likely remain elevated and in a sense, keep high inflation higher for longer,” Stovall said. Warped demand and worker shortages Since the pandemic, a surge in demand for physical goods has thrown supply chains entirely out of whack, snarling logistics and triggering huge price distortions. “Inflation is primarily caused by excessive demand chasing too few goods,” said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  This demand ran headlong into factory shutdowns in China, triggering cascading maritime traffic jams at Pacific ports. When vessels docked, there weren’t enough workers to unload the cargo or drive the trucks that would transport it first to warehouses, then to consumers.  “The overall demand for merchandise went up quite dramatically, so we were suddenly asking our system to handle a lot more stuff,” Dollar said. The result was chaos, and a sudden clamoring for workers – at any price.  “The lack of truckers reflects [that] we need more workers than we actually have, and that’s being resolved through higher wages,” Haworth said. As of June, there were more than three-quarters of a million additional workers in the transportation and warehousing sectors than before the pandemic. Salaries and stimulus Economists expect wage gains, which have been hovering at just above 5% on an annualized basis, to moderate through the rest of the year. But employers are still facing an acute shortage of workers, putting pressure on businesses to offer competitive salaries to attract and retain talent.  There were 10.7 million unfilled jobs in June, the BLS reported last week. While down from a record 11.7 million in April, that’s still almost two open positions for every American worker without a job. “What we’re not yet clear about is, what is the new post-pandemic normal when it comes to demand? For now, it looks like wage pressures are here for a bit,” Haworth said.  That’s because unlike supply-chain snarls or even whipsawing commodity prices, inflation that creeps into wages is not easily undone. Even if companies can pay less for components or raw materials, they are unlikely to implement pay cuts, so inflation lingers. “It’s highly correlated to wage growth. That’s not to say higher wages are a bad thing,” Haworth said. “When people have more money, they can buy more things. But if there’s not actually more things, prices go up. Ultimately, that does translate into some pressure for prices on everything else.” Recent wage gains are coming on the heels of fiscal and monetary policies that contributed to an economy awash in liquidity as a result of stimulus payments to individuals and businesses, as well as quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.  “They injected a ton of money into the system,” Klearman said. Like higher wages, all this cash – and too few goods to spend it on – is another contributor to price hikes consumers are experiencing on everything from cars to camping equipment to cookies. Light at the end of the tunnel? Despite expectations that inflation will likely stick around into 2023, there are some bright spots. In addition to paying less to commute and run errands, Stovall says high-flying airfares could come back down to earth, and supermarket shoppers could see some grocery costs fall slightly if producers or distributors don’t have to pay as much for transportation in order to get their goods onto shelves. “You could start to see some food price competition start to enter the marketplace as the cost of transportation input starts to come down,” he said. While supply chain snarls remain in some sectors – General Motors told investors on its quarterly conference call last month that it made 95,000 vehicles over the preceding quarter that can’t be finished, or sold, because the company can’t get the parts it needs to finish them – there is a sense that the earlier period of gridlock is easing.  There have also been some recent high-profile instances of retail markdowns: Walmart and Target both said they have had to slash prices to unload large amounts of unsold inventory that has lingered on shelves as Americans have shifted their spending back to services like dining out and live events. There is also renewed, albeit uncertain, hope that President Joe Biden will roll back one or more tranches of the punitive tariffs Trump slapped on China in what experts agree was a largely failed bid to force Beijing to purchase more American agricultural products and other key exports.  An analysis by the Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that, over time, rolling back Trump-imposed and other tariffs could pare inflation by as much as 1.3 percentage points, saving the average American household close to $800 a year. “It would certainly be smart to remove the tariffs now,” Dollar said. “They’re not meeting any objectives and they’re being paid for by American households.”",Peter Mcnally;Sam Stovall;Rob Haworth;Jeff Klearman;Joe Biden,Walmart;Bureau Of Labor Statistics;Cnn;Federal Reserve;Federal Reserve;United States;Peterson Institute Of

350,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/justice-department-abortion-idaho/,"The Biden administration filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Idaho for restricting access to abortion to patients who need lifesaving medical treatment, the first such Justice Department challenge since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. Idaho’s near-total abortion ban, which will take effect later this month, would make it nearly impossible, according to the Justice Department, for patients who need an abortion in emergency medical situations, such as an ectopic pregnancy or other complications, from receiving potentially lifesaving treatment. “In the days since the Dobbs decision, there have been widespread reports of delays or denials to pregnant women experiencing medical emergencies,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news conference Tuesday. “We will use every tool at our disposal to ensure that pregnant women get the medical care that they are entitled to.” The trigger law, which was passed in 2020, would make providing abortions a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The ban has exceptions for cases of rape or incest if reported to law enforcement or to prevent the death of the pregnant person.  The Justice Department is suing under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which states that hospitals receiving Medicare funds “must provide medical treatment necessary to stabilize that condition before transferring or discharging the patient,” according to Tuesday’s lawsuit. “The Idaho law would make it a criminal offense for doctors to comply with EMTALA’s requirement to provide stabilizing treatment, even where a doctor determines that abortion is the medical treatment necessary to prevent a patient from suffering severe health risks or even death,” DOJ said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden accused the Justice Department of filing “a politically motivated lawsuit.” DOJ last month created a task force aimed at protecting abortion fights following the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs that overturned Roe v. Wade and struck down the federal right to abortion. Under the Idaho law, which is set to take effect on August 25, abortion providers could be subject to arrest and prosecution if a prosecutor can show that an abortion has been performed, with the burden placed on providers to prove an “affirmative defense” at trial, according to the DOJ.  The law “places medical professionals in an impossible situation, they must either withhold stabilizing treatment required by EMTALA or risk felony prosecution and license revocation. In so doing, the law will chill providers’ willingness to perform abortions in emergency situations,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, who’s the head of the task force, said Tuesday. Garland said that the lawsuit has “nothing to do with going around” the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs. “The Supreme Court said that each state can make its own decisions with respect to abortion, but so too can the federal government,” he told reporters Tuesday. “Nothing that the Supreme Court said, said that the statutes passed by Congress, such as EMTALA are in any way invalid. It’s quite the opposite. The Supreme Court left it to the people’s representatives. EMTALA  was a decision made by the Congress of the United States. The supremacy clause is a decision made in the Constitution of the United States. Federal law invalidates state laws that are in direct contradiction.” Abortion providers and advocates in Idaho have also challenged the state’s trigger law, arguing that the law is so vague that providers are unsure whether they can provide care for patients in cases such as miscarriages. The state Supreme Court is set to hear the case on Wednesday.

480,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/assateague-feral-horses-origin-scn-trnd/,"The unexpected discovery of a 16th-century horse tooth in modern-day Haiti has provided credence for an age-old folk story about the origin of feral horses on an island off Maryland and Virginia. The famous wild Chincoteague ponies have lived for centuries on Assateague Island, a barrier island on the Atlantic coast. But no one is quite sure how they got there. A 1947 children’s book inspired by local legend, “Misty of Chincoteague,” suggests that the ponies are the descendants of Spanish horses who swam to the island after a Spanish ship wrecked off the coast of Virginia, reverting to a feral state over the years. But research published in PLoS ONE by scientists from the Florida Museum of Natural History on July 22 provides new scientific support for the theory based on the discovery of the oldest known DNA from a domesticated horse in the Americas. Nicolas Delsol, a postdoctoral researcher at the Florida Museum of Natural History, was researching cow bones from 16th-century archaeological sites in an effort to understand the introduction of domesticated cows to the Americas during Spanish colonization. He conducted DNA sequencing on a “huge collection of archaeological remains” from Puerto Real, an early Spanish town located in modern-day Haiti. The town was established by the Spanish in 1507 but abandoned in 1578. “One of the bones that I thought was from a cow was misidentified,” Delsol explained in an interview with CNN. “A small fragment of tooth was actually (from) a horse.” The discovery was “completely unexpected,” said Delsol. “We quickly realized it was maybe the first domestic horse genome that we had from the early colonies of America.” The genetic analysis “confirms what we could expect from the historical documents, saying that the first horses were boarded on boats from the Iberian peninsula from southern Spain, most likely,” said Delsol. Horses were a crucial part of Spanish society, he said – so important that Spanish colonizers brought them on the grueling and logistically challenging journey across the Atlantic Ocean. But the genetic analysis of the 16th-century tooth also helped Delsol identify the closest living relative of the early domestic horses: the Chincoteague ponies. The genetic similarity lends credence to the belief that the ponies are descendants of early Spanish horses, says Delsol. “It might show some veracity behind this legend, that it is rooted in an actual event,” he said. However, just because the feral ponies are likely descended from Spanish horses doesn’t mean they came from a shipwreck, the researcher noted. “The Spanish could have left them on the island like they did with some other species, like pigs or cattle, left them to breed to have some local stock,” he explained. The discovery also provides more evidence for just how far north Spanish colonizers in the Americas reached. “It shows something that is not widely known but is partially studied, that the Spanish were not only present in the Caribbean region, and in Mexico and in South America, but also exploring their options much farther north on the east coast of the US in the mid-Atlantic region,” said Delsol. “We have some evidence of Spanish presence, Spanish expeditions inland in the Carolinas.” Going forward, Delsol and his team hope to expand their research on the Puerto Real specimens – and explore how early colonizers depended on horses for cattle ranching in the Americas.",Atlantic Ocean;Nicolas Delsol;Nicolas Delsol,Florida Museum Of Natural History On;Florida Museum Of Natural History;Florida Museum Of Natural History;Cnn;Cnn,"ECON_STOCKMARKET,3174;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2882;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2980;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,52;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,890;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,1415;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,1701;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,1828;GENERAL_HEALTH,2890;GENERAL_HEALTH,2988;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,2890;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,2988;WB_1406_DISEASES,2890;WB_1406_DISEASES,2988;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2890;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2988;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2890;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2988;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2897;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2995;AGRICULTURE,3128;AGRICULTURE,3850;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,157;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,555;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,1996;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,2101;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,2412;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,2562;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,2759;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,3839;SCIENCE,952;SCIENCE,2815;TAX_FNCACT_RESEARCHER,952;TAX_FNCACT_RESEARCHER,2815;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2163;MARITIME_INCIDENT_SELF_IDENTIFIED,2798;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,421;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,548;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,594;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,1154;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,1287;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,1360;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,1508;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,2132;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,2176;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,2555;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,2752;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,3034;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,3265;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,3389;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,3623;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,3642;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,548;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,594;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,1154;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,1287;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,1360;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,1508;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,2132;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,2176;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,2555;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,2752;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,3034;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,3265;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,3389;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,3623;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,3642;MARITIME,2018;",Mexico;Spanish;Chincoteague;Puerto Real;Maryland;America;Assateague Island;Carolinas;Virginia;Spain;Haiti
213,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/bob-dylan-sex-abuse-lawsuit-thrown-out/,"A federal judge in New York City has thrown out a lawsuit that accused Bob Dylan of sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl in 1965. The plaintiff voluntarily dropped the case on Thursday, according to court documents. Manhattan Federal Judge Katherine Polk Failla officially dismissed the filing “with prejudice,” meaning the case cannot be refiled.  Dylan’s lawyers on Wednesday claimed the plaintiff failed to present court-ordered documents, including text messages and emails. Dylan’s lawyers said the plaintiff, now a woman aged in her 60s identified in the lawsuit by the initials “J.C.”, “destroyed evidence directly relevant to the central factual allegations in this litigation.” Orin Snyder, lead counsel for Dylan, said, “This case is over. It is outrageous that it was ever brought in the first place.” He added that the case was a “lawyer-driven sham” and he is pleased about its dismissal. The 2021 lawsuit accused Dylan of befriending the plaintiff, “to lower her inhibitions with the object of sexually abusing her, which he did, coupled with the provision of drugs, alcohol and threats of physical violence, leaving her emotionally scarred and psychologically damaged to this day.”  The lawsuit alleged the abuse occurred at Dylan’s apartment at the Hotel Chelsea in New York City when the plaintiff was aged 12.  In a statement after the filing last year, a spokesperson for Dylan said “the 56-year-old claim is untrue and will be vigorously defended.” CNN has reached out to the plaintiff’s lawyers for comment. Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, in 1940. He has sold more than 125 million records during his career. Some of his most famous songs include “The Times They Are a-Changin’,” “Like a Rolling Stone” and “Blowin’ in the Wind.” In 2008, Dylan won a Pulitzer Prize special citation for “his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.” In 2016, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.”",Katherine Polk Failla;Orin Snyder;Robert Allen Zimmerman;Robert Zimmerman;Robert Zimmerman;Bob Dylan,Cnn;Cnn;Hotel Chelsea,"TRIAL,62;TRIAL,634;TRIAL,973;TRIAL,1275;TRIAL,1405;TRIAL,1457;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,592;RAPE,1435;RAPE,1487;DRUG_TRADE,1136;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1136;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1136;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1136;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1136;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1136;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1136;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1136;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1558;WB_2670_JOBS,1812;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1812;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,1812;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,1812;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,1812;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,1237;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,20;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,258;DISCRIMINATION,327;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,327;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,433;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,559;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,1676;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,667;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1177;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2029;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2220;",Minnesota;Manhattan;American;New York
688,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/alex-jones-january-6/,"Approximately two years’ worth of text messages sent and received by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones have been turned over to the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, a person familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday. The messages were handed over to the committee by Mark Bankston, the attorney who represented two Sandy Hook parents who successfully sued Jones in Texas and won nearly $50 million in a civil trial that concluded last week.  Bankston would only tell CNN that he is “cooperating with the committee.” The select committee declined to comment. During the trial, Bankston revealed that one of Jones’ lawyers had “messed up” and inadvertently sent him the two years of text messages. Bankston also said during the trial that the January 6 committee had expressed interest in the material. Jones’ attorney Federico Andino Reynal asked the judge in the case to order Bankston to destroy the material and not transmit it to the House committee, but the judge declined. “I’m not standing between you and Congress,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble told Bankston when asked about sending Jones’ texts to the committee. “That is not my job. I’m not going to do that.” The source wouldn’t provide details of the exact timeframe of when Jones sent and received the texts in question. Bankston previously said that the most recent message on the phone was from mid-2020, months before the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Most of the people Jones was texting were his employees and members of his family, the person familiar with the matter said. But, the person familiar with the matter added, some of the text messages indicate Jones was in touch with Trump allies.  Jones was a central player on January 6. He was on restricted US Capitol grounds that day, riling up protesters, though he did not enter the building itself. He has rejected any suggestion that he was involved in the planning of violence, and claims he tried to prevent people at the Capitol from breaking the law. Jones testified before the January 6 committee earlier this year, but he later said on his show that he repeatedly asserted his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent during the closed-door deposition. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who sits on the committee, said Sunday on CNN that the committee was still waiting to see the texts and was interested to learn more about Jones’ role in the events at the Capitol. “Well, we know that his behavior did incentivize some of the January 6 conduct and we want to know more about that,” Lofgren said. “We don’t know what we’ll find in the texts because we haven’t seen them. But we’ll look at it and learn more, I’m sure.” It is unclear if the Justice Department had received the texts as of Monday afternoon. The Justice Department declined to comment.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission received a call about the incident at around 3:45 p.m. Thursday, according to a statement shared with CNN. Lake Thonotosassa is in Hillsborough County, near Tampa. The Hillsborough County Fire Rescue transported the 34-year-old victim to the hospital, the fish and wildlife commission said, adding that it dispatched a contracted alligator trapper to the lake and is continuing to investigate the incident. Around 1.3 million alligators live in Florida, in all 67 counties, according to the commission. The agency recommends people stay away from alligators and avoid handling or feeding them. Nuisance alligators – those that are 4 feet or longer and believed to pose a threat to people, their pets or property – are trapped and killed by the agency through its Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program. A total of 9,442 nuisance alligators were killed in 2021, the commission says.  There have been at least three fatal alligator attacks in the US this year. In July, an elderly woman died after falling into a lake and being grabbed by two alligators in Florida.

86,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit/,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia, according to a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official, despite warnings from Biden administration officials, who are worried about China’s response to such a high-profile visit.  The stop – the first for a US House speaker in 25 years – is not currently on Pelosi’s public itinerary and comes at a time when US-China relations are already at a low point. The Taiwanese official added that she is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight. It is unclear when exactly Pelosi will land in Taipei.  The US official added that Defense Department officials are working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe.  Pelosi arrived in Singapore on Monday for the first official stop of the Asia tour, where she met with the country’s president, prime minister and other top officials.   On Tuesday, Malaysia’s state media Bernama confirmed that Pelosi and a congressional delegation had arrived in the country and were scheduled to meet with the prime minister and parliament speaker.  The delegation’s itinerary includes stops in South Korea and Japan, but no official mention has been made of a visit to Taiwan. During a regular foreign ministry briefing Monday, China warned against the “egregious political impact” of Pelosi’s planned visit to the self-governing island that China claims as a part of its territory and reiterated that its military “won’t sit by idly” if Beijing feels its “sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being threatened. “We would like to tell the US once again that China is standing by, and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army will never sit idly by. China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters, when asked about the fallout from Pelosi leading a congressional delegation to Taipei. “As for what measures, if she dares to go, then let’s wait and see,” Zhao added.   Though China’s military did not mention Taiwan, the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command said it would “bury incoming enemies” in a video posted online Monday showing off its weaponry and fighting tactics. “Firmly stand by and ready for the fighting command; Bury all incoming enemies,” a message posted on Weibo said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the administration’s line that it is Pelosi’s decision whether she visits, adding, “we do not know what Speaker Pelosi intends to do.” “Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government,” Blinken said at the United Nations on Monday afternoon. “The decision is entirely the Speaker’s.” Blinken said that such a visit has precedent, noting past speakers and members of Congress have visited Taiwan. “And so if the speaker does decide to visit and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing,” Blinken said. “We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in in any escalation going forward.” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby earlier on Monday that the Biden administration will support Pelosi on a trip to Taiwan. “We want to make sure that when she travels overseas, she can do so safely and securely and we’re going to make sure of that. There is no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There is no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,” Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.” “We shouldn’t be as a country – we shouldn’t be intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions. This is an important trip for the speaker to be on and we’re going to do whatever we can to support her,” Kirby continued. Asked if the US was prepared for fallout with China over the visit, Kirby said that “there is no change to our policy. No change to our focus on trying to keep a free and safe and open Indo-Pacific.” The issue of Taiwan remains one of the most contentious. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed it at length in a two-hour-and-17-minute phone call on Thursday, as tensions mounted between Washington and Beijing.  “The question of Taiwan is the most sensitive, important core issue in China-US relations,” said Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang at the Aspen Security Forum in July. While Biden has said publicly the US military did not believe it was a good time Pelosi to visit Taiwan, he has stopped short of telling her directly not to go, according to two sources. Administration officials have worked over recent weeks to apprise the House speaker of the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island of 24 million residents, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials. But Biden did not believe it was his place to tell her she should not go, and he has avoided commenting publicly about her trip since his initial statement on July 21. Biden said last month that the US military opposed Pelosi visiting Taiwan, though since then has refused to elaborate on the warnings. The White House has said it is up to the House speaker where she travels. Still, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said he’d discussed a visit to Asia with Pelosi. The administration takes extra care for Pelosi’s security when she travels overseas because she is in the presidential line of succession. Administration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength. Officials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.  Pelosi has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, “To those who died for democracy.” In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19, urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.  “I would say there’s been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,” Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress’ US-China working group, told CNN. “I just don’t think it’s their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.” Liu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in “regular contact” with members of Congress, including Larsen. “On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,” Pengyu said. “The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.” “We hope serious consequences could be avoided,” he added. “This is in the common interests of both China and the US.” Many Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi’s right to travel to Taiwan. “It is Speaker Pelosi’s decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,” said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen’s Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. “In our democratic system – we operate with separate but equal branches of government.” “It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,” he added. Other members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip. California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has “always supported Taiwan.”  But when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, “You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that’s when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.” When asked what she thought, she said, “I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.” This story has been updated with additional details Monday.

357,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/tiktok-lawmakers-explainer/,"Two years after then-President Donald Trump said he would ban TikTok in the United States through an executive order, the short-form video platform is once again under scrutiny in Washington. And the underlying issue remains largely the same: TikTok’s ties to China through its parent company, Bytedance.  A growing number of US lawmakers are calling for the Biden administration to take action against TikTok, citing apparent national security and data privacy concerns. The criticism stems from a Buzzfeed News report in June that said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China. The reporting cited leaked audio recordings of dozens of internal TikTok meetings, including one where a TikTok employee allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.”  In a response to the report, TikTok previously said it “has consistently maintained that our engineers in locations outside of the US, including China, can be granted access to US user data on an as-needed basis under those strict controls.” A TikTok executive testified before a Senate panel last year that it doesn’t share information with the Chinese government and that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China.  The renewed pressure on TikTok comes as the platform’s influence continues to grow in the United States. After Trump left office, the Biden administration revoked the executive order and largely walked back official attempts to ban TikTok. Last year, TikTok said it topped 1 billion monthly active users globally, and more than 100 million users are said to be in the United States, according to some market research estimates. Activity on the app continues to shape the news cycle, popular music, culinary trends and more in the country. Meanwhile, other US social media giants continue to imitate TikTok’s features in an effort to compete. Some critics previously blasted Trump’s crusade against the fast-growing video app as political theater rooted in xenophobia, and called out Trump’s odd suggestion that the United States should get a “cut” of any deal if it forced the app’s sale to an American firm. But the latest round of pressure from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle shows how the national security issue continues to plague TikTok in the United States, even under a new administration.  Here’s what you should know about the latest scrutiny of TikTok and Bytedance along the Beltway.  What lawmakers are saying about TikTok A range of US lawmakers and officials have in recent months called for new investigations into TikTok’s data storage practices or even for the app to be yanked off US app stores.  A coalition of GOP senators led by Tom Cotton of Arkansas sent a letter in June to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calling for answers about actions the Biden administration is taking to combat the “the national security and privacy risks posed by TikTok.” A separate group of Republican senators led by Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee also sent a letter of questions to TikTok’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew. The senators said the recent media reports “confirm what lawmakers long suspected about TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance — they are using their access to a treasure trove of US consumer data to surveil Americans.” Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence urged the Federal Trade Commission to formally investigate TikTok and ByteDance. “In light of repeated misrepresentations by TikTok concerning its data security, data processing, and corporate governance practices, we urge you to act promptly on this matter,” the letter signed by Mark Warner of Virginia and Marco Rubio of Florida stated. In a letter, a member of the Federal Communications Commission urged Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr claimed that ByteDance was “beholden” to the Chinese government, and “required by law to comply” with the Chinese government’s surveillance demands. The letter was widely reported on, despite the fact that the FCC has no role in overseeing app stores. In a letter responding to Blackburn and others, Chew said: “We have not provided US user data to the [Communist Party of China], nor would we if asked.”  How TikTok has responded Amid the recent uproar, TikTok announced that it has moved its US user data to Oracle’s cloud platform so that “100% of US user traffic” is now hosted by the cloud provider, potentially addressing national security concerns. In his letter to lawmakers, which mentioned the shift to Oracle, Chew said the broader goal for the company’s data security efforts is to build trust and “make substantive progress toward compliance with a final agreement with the US Government that will fully safeguard user data and US national security interests.” Chew didn’t name any specific groups within the US government, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has been investigating TikTok since 2019. The government body, however, has not provided any recent updates on its investigation. Citing anonymous sources, Reuters recently reported that CFIUS has been in “extensive discussions with TikTok on security issues.” Representatives for CFIUS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok also recently pledged to offer researchers more transparency about activity on the platform, including access for a select group to its API, or application programming interface.  “We know that just saying ‘trust us’ is not enough,” TikTok chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas said in a blog post announcing the planned update. “That’s why long ago we made an important commitment to transparency, particularly when it comes to how we moderate and recommend content.” Why the national security concerns won’t go away While TikTok has long pushed back at the national security concerns as “unfounded,” the concerns persist.  “The fact that the Chinese government, if it really wants to, can make any company in its borders comply with data access requests, I think is really at the root of a lot of these concerns about TikTok,” said Justin Sherman, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative.  “There are real national security questions being asked,” Sherman added, but there are also issues with galvanizing much of the conversation around anti-China rhetoric. Focusing too narrowly on the national origin of an app’s owner, or just on a single company, only looks at one way that data can be accessed, Sherman said. As a result, it loses all the other ways that data flows through advertisers, brokers and much more.  “It’s good to have this kind of attention” on data privacy and security issues, Sherman said. “But if all you’re doing is writing letters about specific companies and not actually writing and testing laws and regulations to control for risks, in the long run, nothing’s really going to change too much.” ",Janet Yellen;Vanessa Pappas;Marco Rubio;Mark Warner;Brendan Carr;Marsha Blackburn;Justin Sherman,Google;Communications Commission;Senate Select Committee On Intelligence;Atlantic Council

296,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/virginia-caron-nazario-pepper-spray/,"A Virginia police officer who pepper-sprayed an Army lieutenant and pushed him to the ground during a traffic stop in 2020 should not face state charges, a special prosecutor says, though he formally referred the case to the US Attorney’s Office for a federal civil rights investigation. “Although I find the video very disturbing and frankly unsettling, (Officer Raymond) Gutierrez’s use of force to remove (Caron) Nazario did not violate state law as he had given multiple commands for Nazario to exit the vehicle,” Special Prosecutor and Commonwealth’s Attorney Anton Bell wrote after his investigation. Two Windsor Police officers pulled over 2nd Lt. Nazario, who is Black, in December 2020 and repeatedly used pepper spray on him and pointed their guns at him, according to a news release from former Attorney General Mark Herring’s Office. Officer Gutierrez was fired after the incident but another officer remained on the job, Windsor Town Manager William Saunders previously confirmed to CNN. CNN previously reported on the video that captured the encounter. “The problematic issue, however, were Gutierrez’s statements throughout the entire ordeal, which would lead a reasonable person to wonder whether underlying bias was a the root of how and why Nazario was treated in like manner,” Bell wrote.  CNN has been unable to identify a representative for Gutierrez for comment. CNN has reached out to the town of Windsor and the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia for comment. After Gutierrez was fired in 2021, Windsor Police Chief R.D. Riddle told reporters that Gutierrez’s use of the phrase “ride the lightning” in reference to the Taser during the incident was “inappropriate and created unnecessary fear.” Riddle said he “lost faith” in Gutierrez’s ability to live up to the department’s standards, adding, “I personally felt that there was no way he could effectively serve our community anymore.” An attorney for Nazario applauded the Commonwealth’s Attorney for requesting the US Attorney’s Office investigate Gutierrez but disagreed with the findings that Gutierrez should not face state charges. “It should not be the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s place to determine alone that no crime has been committed (especially when the Commonwealth’s Attorney harbors such concerns that they refer the matter to US DOJ,” Attorney Jonathan Arthur said in an email to CNN. “That is why we have the jury system. That is why we have judges. That is not why we have Commonwealth’s Attorneys.” “All too often, when it comes to law enforcement violating the laws, we see our Commonwealth’s Attorneys fail to apply the same zeal and standards when “prosecuting” law enforcement as they do with other citizens,” Arthur added.  Former Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring sued the town of Windsor in December 2021 as a result of the incident, accusing the town’s police department of discriminating against African Americans and violating their civil rights. The lawsuit was the first case brought under a new law that allows the state’s leading law-enforcement officer “to sue to stop systemic violations of Virginians’ rights,” according to a previous release from Herring’s office. A spokesperson for Attorney General Jason Miyares told CNN Tuesday that the lawsuit is still pending. The attorney general’s office would not comment on the result of the special prosecutor’s investigation or the formal request for the US Attorney’s Office to open a federal civil rights investigation.

437,https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/21/us/space-shuttle-program-fast-facts/,"Here’s a look at NASA’s Space Shuttle Program which ended in 2011 after 135 missions. Facts The space shuttle is the “world’s first reusable spacecraft,” launching like a rocket, orbiting like a spacecraft and landing like a plane. Space shuttles could carry satellites, space probes, and other cargo into orbit around Earth on both commercial and non-commercial missions.  The space shuttle system was made up of three components:- Twin solid rocket boosters. They provided 80% of the launch thrust.- The external tank, which provided fuel to the space shuttle main engines during launch.- The orbiter. It acted as the crew’s home during the flight. All of the components were reused except for the external fuel tank. It burned up in the atmosphere after launch. Crews ranged in size from five to seven people. More than 600 crew members flew on shuttle missions. The space shuttle program sent more than 3 million pounds of cargo into space. The longest any shuttle stayed in orbit on a single mission was 17.5 days, in November 1996. The space shuttle was 184 feet long. The orbiter was 122 feet long.  The gross liftoff weight of the space shuttle was 4.5 million pounds. Five shuttles flew into space during the program’s history: Atlantis, Challenger, Columbia, Discovery and Endeavour. An early model of the shuttle, the Enterprise was used for approach and landing tests during the 1970s but it never actually launched into space.  Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour were each designed to fly 100 missions, though they flew much fewer than that.  Timeline January 5, 1972 - President Richard Nixon announces the intent to develop the first space shuttle for travel into space. March 24, 1979 - Columbia is delivered to the Kennedy Space Center.

July 4, 2006 - Discovery is launched. July 17, 2006 - Discovery lands at Kennedy Space Center. September 9, 2006 - Atlantis launches. The six astronauts conduct three spacewalks and deliver and install a 35,000-pound addition with giant solar arrays to power the International Space Station. The shuttle lands on September 21, 2006 at the Kennedy Space Center.  December 9, 2006 - Discovery lifts off, beginning a 12-day mission. The crew of seven continues construction on the International Space Station by rewiring the orbiting laboratory and adding a two-ton segment to its integrated truss structure. June 8, 2007 - The Atlantis launches, carrying a crew of seven astronauts headed for the International Space Station. The crew plans to install a new segment and solar panels on the space station and retrieve astronaut Sunita Williams, who has been at the space station since December. June 23, 2007 - Atlantis lands at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the first time a shuttle has landed at Edwards since 2005. Aboard Atlantis is Williams, returning from the International Space Station where she set an endurance record for the longest single spaceflight for a woman (195 days) and the record for most time spent spacewalking by a woman. August 8, 2007 - Endeavour launches, carrying teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan and six crew mates. October 23, 2007 - Discovery launches. Aboard Discovery is Harmony, an Italian-built live-in compartment that will be attached to the ISS. Discovery is under the command of Pamela Melroy, the second woman to lead a space shuttle mission. November 7, 2007 - Discovery lands at Kennedy Space Center, with Melroy becoming the second woman to land a space shuttle. Returning with the shuttle is Clayton Anderson, who had been on board the ISS since June. February 7, 2008 - Atlantis launches, carrying the ISS’s newest science lab, named Columbus. Atlantis also drops off French Air Force General Leopold Eyharts, who will replace NASA astronaut Daniel Tani. March 11, 2008 - Endeavour launches, the first night launch for a shuttle since 2006 and only the second night launch since Columbia disintegrated during re-entry. The shuttle is headed to the ISS, where it will deliver a Canadian-built robot named Dextre and the first part of the Japanese-built Kibo lab. Also on board is astronaut Garrett Reisman, who is replacing Léopold Eyharts. May 31, 2008 - Discovery launches with the purpose of transporting components for the Kibo lab, as well as a Japanese Remote Manipulator System to be attached to the ISS. Flight Engineer Garrett Reisman will leave with the Discovery crew and be replaced by Greg Chamtoff.  November 14, 2008 - Endeavour launches. The crew of seven will renovate a kitchen and bathroom on the International Space Station and are delivering a new refrigerator.  March 15, 2009 - Discovery launches. The shuttle is headed to the ISS to deliver the final set of solar array wings. With the completed array, the station is expected to be able to provide enough electricity when the crew size is doubled to six in May February 24, 2011 - Discovery launches on its final mission. March 9, 2011 - Discovery lands at Kennedy Space Center. Discovery has spent 365 days in space during the course of its 39 missions, the first of which was in August 1984. It has orbited Earth 5,830 times and traveled 148,221,675 miles. April 12, 2011 - NASA announces the locations that will host the retired space shuttles:- Atlantis will be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida- Endeavour will be displayed at the California Science Center in Los Angeles- Discovery will be displayed at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia- Enterprise will be displayed at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York April 29, 2011 - Endeavour’s final launch is delayed due to an issue with the shuttle’s heating system. The shuttle ultimately launches on May 16, 2011.  June 1, 2011 - Endeavour returns to the Kennedy Space Center after its final mission.  July 8, 2011 - Atlantis launches. This is the space shuttle program’s final mission. July 21, 2011 - The Atlantis lands at Kennedy Space Center, marking the sunset of the space shuttle program.  April 19, 2012 - The Discovery arrives at its new home, the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum in Washington.  April 27, 2012-June 6, 2012 - Enterprise makes a three-part trip to its new home at the Intrepid in New York. The first leg of its journey is a ferry flight atop a Boeing 747 from Washington to New York. The Enterprise is then trucked to the waterfront, towed up the Hudson River and hoisted onto the deck of the Intrepid via a floating crane. September 19-21, 2012 - Endeavour takes a three-day ferry flight from Cape Canaveral to Los Angeles International Airport on a farewell tour across the southern United States.  October 12-14, 2012 - Endeavour is transported approximately 12 miles, at a top speed of 2 mph, from the Los Angeles International Airport, through the streets of Inglewood and Los Angeles to the California Science Center. Trees, traffic signs, utility poles and other structures in the path of Endeavour’s wings cause hours of delays. June 29, 2013 - The Atlantis exhibit opens at the Kennedy Space Visitor Complex in Cape Canaveral, Florida.  June 27, 2015 - The “Forever Remembered” display, which features a 12-foot section of fuselage from Challenger and the flight deck windows from Columbia, opens in the Atlantis exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center.

41,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/springville-fire-man-arrested-spider/,"A 26-year-old man who was arrested for starting a wildfire told Utah authorities he had been attempting to kill a spider with a lighter when he started the blaze, according to the Utah County Sheriff’s Office.  Deputies responded Monday to the Bonneville Shoreline area near Springville for a fire that was quickly spreading up a mountain, according to a probable cause statement from the sheriff’s office.  When they arrived, fire personnel informed them they had encountered a man who told them he had started the fire, according to the statement. The man, who identified himself as Cory Allan Martin, said he had found a spider on the mountain and was trying to burn it with a lighter when a nearby brush ignited and flames began spreading, according to the sheriff’s office.  “He was placed in custody for the reckless burning and was placed in the back of the patrol vehicle,” the probable cause statement said. “While searching Cory’s belongings, a jar of marijuana and paraphernalia was found.” Martin was taken to the Utah County Jail for reckless burning, possession of a controlled substance and possession of paraphernalia, according to the statement.  It is unclear if Martin has an attorney. He was released Monday night, according to jail records.  The blaze scorched land from the base of a mountain all the way to the top, the probable cause statement said, and required a response from multiple fire agencies, including helicopter units.  It was about 90% contained Wednesday morning and had burned about 60 acres, fire officials said on Twitter.

He recently won $25,000 a year for life in the multistate lottery game Lucky for Life. The win comes six years after winning a $1 million prize in the Massachusetts State Lottery’s “Cadillac Riches” game, state lottery officials said.  He purchased both winning tickets from the same location, Food City in Turners Falls. Miller’s latest win matched a February 18 drawing, which he claimed at the Massachusetts Lottery headquarters this month. Instead of taking $25,000 a year, he decided to cash out a one-time payment of $390,000 before taxes, lottery officials said. Food City will receive a $5,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. It is unclear what Miller will do with his prize money, but with luck like his, he might as well buy more lottery tickets.",Kevin Miller,Cnn;Food City;Food City,,Turners Falls;Maryland;Massachusetts
641,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/victoria-spartz-ukraine-republican-reaction/,"When a bipartisan group of lawmakers visited the Ukraine border in March, an unexpected guest showed up on the trip: GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana. Spartz, the first Ukrainian-born member of the US Congress and an outspoken advocate for her home country, had expressed interest in joining the congressional delegation but wasn’t invited to attend the trip, which consisted primarily of House Foreign Affairs Committee members, a panel where Spartz is not a member.  So, she used her own funds to fly to the border of Ukraine in Poland and linked up with lawmakers once there to join in on some of their meetings, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Her surprise appearance, the circumstances of which have not been previously reported, was initially viewed as a welcome addition – albeit an unusual one – as lawmakers sought to rally Western support for Ukraine amid Russia’s bloody assault on the country that began a week earlier. But members who were part of the official trip told CNN that Spartz was “argumentative,” “accusatory,” and “unhelpful” during key meetings with NATO members, generals and government officials, sparking concern that her presence was doing more harm than good. “She crashed our CoDel. She was like a bull in a china shop,” said one GOP lawmaker, who like other members for this story was granted anonymity to speak more freely about a colleague and due to the sensitive nature of the subject. “I don’t know if it was pent-up frustration or she didn’t feel like she was getting enough proper information, but she was just accusatory and rude.”  Spartz, in an email to CNN, pushed back on the anonymous criticism of her decision to elbow her way into the congressional delegation and refuted the description of her behavior on the trip. “This accusation is a cowardly misrepresentation of facts by some jealous members or staff since we had a very productive bipartisan CODEL in March,” Spartz said. “I did not come to Congress to get paid for my travel vacations or dinners, but rather get things done. I have always been willing to spend my own hard-earned money to help with causes I care about.” That bipartisan frustration over Spartz’s behavior was only the beginning. In the nearly six months since the war began, Spartz has publicly criticized the Ukraine government, peddled corruption allegations against the Ukrainian government and some of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top aides, and spurred complaints from her colleagues that she is mirroring pro-Russia talking points.  “President Zelensky has to stop playing politics and theater, and start governing to better support his military and local governments,” Spartz said in a press release last month, in one example of her outspoken criticisms of Kyiv.  Spartz, a 43-year-old businesswoman, has repeatedly insisted, publicly and privately, that she wants Ukraine to win, and that she is only attacking Kyiv because she wants to help remove any potential obstacles to a Ukrainian victory over Russia. She says she has visited Ukraine six times since the invasion began and has also slammed Russia consistently, including as recently as Tuesday when she tweeted that Russia should be declared a terrorist state.  Still, Spartz’s bellicose rhetoric aimed at Zelensky and his advisers has frustrated lawmakers in both parties, White House officials and members of the Ukrainian parliament alike. They worry she is undermining their efforts to stay united behind Ukraine at a pivotal moment and openly question where she is getting some of her information, according to interviews with over a dozen lawmakers, aides and administration sources. Meanwhile, multiple briefings from the Biden administration and private pleas from senior Republicans have done little to rein in Spartz’s vocal criticism, sources said.  Once seen as a crucial messaging asset, Spartz has now become something of a liability for defense hawks who were already worried about fatigue in the United States over the ongoing war abroad. And her continued criticism of Ukraine also comes amid growing skepticism from the MAGA wing of the GOP about keeping weapons and aid flowing to the country. “Because she’s the only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, she has outsize megaphone, outsize influence,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat and former CIA analyst, said to CNN. “I think there’s an open question of why she’s so openly saying something that’s so clearly aligned with Russian talking points.” Spartz contends she has long been concerned about corruption in Ukraine. But lawmakers fear her public criticism could undermine confidence in Zelensky, damage relations between the U.S. and Ukraine, and give on-the-fence lawmakers a reason to oppose the next aid package. Some lawmakers – even those unhappy with her rhetoric – came to Spartz’s defense, arguing she is well-intentioned and just desperate to help her motherland as it’s being ripped apart by war. Spartz was a vocal champion of key legislation to speed up the administration’s ability to send weaponry and other critical resources to Ukraine, attending the bill signing ceremony with President Joe Biden. And lawmakers in both parties have shared in her calls for more rigorous oversight of the weapons heading into Ukraine. “She was overcome with emotion. And I think what you’re seeing now is a manifestation of that,” said a second GOP lawmaker. “What I’m trying to tell her is, I’m well aware of the corruption problem. … But talking about corruption now, when they are under siege, is like wall-papering your bathroom when the house is burning down around you. It’s counterproductive.” Spartz said in an email to CNN that she is just seeking accountability and always gets her information “from the ground and real professionals, not from academics and political hacks who’ve never set foot in Ukraine.” And Spartz said it was the “foreign policy establishment” – not her – who was playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hands. “I also care deeply about people’s lives – the lives of ordinary Ukrainians and the brave Ukrainian military. I cannot let them down even if that means saying unpopular truths that offend the politicians or diverge from the popular narrative of the day,” Spartz said. “I will never give up or give in, and I will do everything I can to see a united Ukraine and a defeated Vladimir Putin.”     Members of both parties push to tone down posture  Even as lawmakers express understanding and sympathy for Spartz’s situation, the top three Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Armed Services Committee have all urged Spartz to tone down her posture, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.  “We’ve all talked to her,” said a third GOP lawmaker. “It’s pissing people off. Because it hurts the cause.” Spartz herself has expressed interest in joining the House Foreign Affairs Committee next year, sources said. But given her recent behavior, some GOP members have warned Republican leaders against that, with one lawmaker saying they would be “very upset” if she received that assignment. When asked about the pushback she’s gotten from top Republican colleagues surrounding her rhetoric and whether it’s playing into Russian disinformation campaigns, Spartz responded: “not true.” “Republican leadership has been supportive and appreciate my demands for accountability and a real strategy for the war effort in Ukraine,” she said. Spartz also admonished her colleagues for making anonymous claims about her interest in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “A lot of members of Congress behave immaturely and are deeply unserious dealing with very serious issues,” she said.  The Biden administration has also gotten involved. Spartz recently received a nearly two-hour briefing from officials from the National Security Council and State Department after requesting one from the White House about Ukraine, sources familiar with the meeting told CNN, where the officials walked through her claims of improper behavior inside the Ukrainian government and either refuted the allegations or said there was not enough evidence to support them.  Spartz also requested a meeting with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley to discuss her concerns, the sources said. The meeting was first reported by Politico. When they met, she again raised concerns about corruption in Ukraine and alleged that US-provided weapons were not going to the right places.  Milley did not dismiss her concerns outright, the sources said – US officials believe corruption continues to be a problem in Ukraine. In a recent call with Ukrainian counterparts, Milley, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed “the importance of Ukraine continuing to implement its reform agenda” with regard to corruption, “despite the challenges caused by the war,” according to a readout provided by the White House.  Broadly, however, Milley explained to Spartz that her concerns were overwrought, the sources explained.  Spartz told CNN that her meeting with Milley “was not my first meeting with him,” and that “I give him credit for his willingness to listen.” “I believe he understands the challenges of our effort in Ukraine, but the politicians and foreign policy establishment are making strategic decisions, not military leaders,” she said. “This should trouble all Americans as these are the know-nothing know-it-alls who oversaw the debacle in Afghanistan, and other foreign policy blunders, and have faced zero accountability.” Several days after meeting with Milley, Spartz continued her public attacks on one of Zelensky’s top aides, accusing him of “creating a per se dictatorship under the disguise of the ongoing war.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN he has not privately spoken to Spartz about her criticism of the Ukraine government. But he did credit the Indiana lawmaker for being passionate about the issue and helping to draw attention to the war – especially in the early days of the conflict, when Spartz delivered an emotional public plea to the Biden administration for a concrete Ukraine strategy during a GOP press conference that garnered widespread media coverage. “The thing you’ve got to understand: she’s got family there, she’s very passionate about it,” McCarthy said. “It’s very personal.” Concerns about Spartz abroad There is also concern about Spartz’s behavior abroad. Slotkin said Spartz came up in multiple meetings and dinners when she was recently in Kyiv and that last week she received a text message from a member of the Ukrainian parliament saying they don’t know if Spartz is being “played” but “she has ruined her reputation in Ukraine.” “All the senior leaders were talking about it. They’re upset about it,” Slotkin said. “They don’t understand why she’s doing this.” Ukrainian officials have become increasingly alarmed by Spartz’s rhetoric over the last several months, Ukrainian sources told CNN, particularly her persistent attacks on Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak. In tweets last month, she accused Yermak of “undemocratic governance” and said he had a “negative reputation” globally. And on July 8, Spartz sent a letter to Biden requesting a briefing specifically about Yermak “and his alleged dealings in connection with Russia.” Spartz’s accusations are similar to those reported by Radio Free Europe before the war, which alleged Yermak had business ties to Russia. That allegation has been used by Zelensky’s critics to suggest Yermak might be too willing to bend to Kremlin demands, particularly following a controversial prisoner swap deal in 2021. There is no evidence that he is under the Kremlin’s sway, however, and he has denied the allegations.  Ukrainian officials have questioned Spartz’s motivations. In text messages to a Zelensky aide on June 24, Spartz offered to “connect” the aide “with the right people” who she said could help Ukraine’s army win.  “Do you want me to send someone good to discuss training when you are back or maybe he could meet with Reznyk or someone else this coming week?” Spartz asked, referring to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov. “Some of them can also bring some very advanced equipment for you to use … he will do it as a favor for you and for me so we will have to keep these meetings ‘off the record,’” Spartz wrote.  Asked about these texts, Spartz told CNN they were taken out of context and that she has “simply been trying to help make connections for anyone willing to help Ukraine win the war especially to some veterans who can give free and unbiased advice as a favor to me since they are my friends.” She added that “the insinuation I have some financial interest is flatly untrue; I’m spending tens of thousands of my own money to help in Ukraine. Mr. Yermak’s financial interests are what merits investigation.” Ukrainian officials have offered to set up a meeting between Yermak and Spartz to clear the air, but Spartz has declined to take it, sources said. Spartz acknowledged that she was offered a meeting with Yermak after she sent the letter to Biden, but then the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry criticized her attacks on Yermak as “cynical” and “baseless.” “I determined this meeting would not be productive under those circumstances,” she said.",Mark Milley;Kevin Mccarthy;Andriy Yermak;Daniel Berehulak;Joe Biden;Volodymyr Zelensky;Elissa Slotkin;Antony

56,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/media/alex-jones-trial-sandy-hook-decision/,"Right-wing talk show host Alex Jones will have to pay the parents of a Sandy Hook shooting victim a little more than $4 million in compensatory damages, a jury decided Thursday, capping a stunning and dramatic case that showcased for the public the real-world harm inflicted by viral conspiracy theories. The award from the jury was far less than what the plaintiffs, Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, had asked for. At the start of the trial, attorneys for Lewis and Heslin asked the jury to award their clients $150 million in compensatory damages. A separate, shorter trial during which punitive damages will be discussed is now expected. Punitive damages are awarded when the court finds the defendant’s behavior to be especially offensive. Mark Bankston, an attorney for the parents, told CNN that the plaintiffs are happy with the jury’s decision, noting that they had also received money prior to the trial due to sanctions the court had hit Jones with. “Having already secured $1.5 million in fines from Mr Jones, the plaintiffs are now due $5.6 million that Alex Jones will have to pay them,” Bankston said. “Neil and Scarlett are thrilled with the result and look forward to putting Mr. Jones’ money to good use,” Bankston added. “Mr Jones on the other hand will not sleep easy tonight. With punitive damages still to be decided and multiple additional defamation lawsuits pending, it is clear that Mr Jones’ time on the American stage is finally coming to an end.” An attorney for Jones could not immediately be reached for comment. Jones himself celebrated the jury’s decision, calling it a “major victory for truth,” in a video posted online to his conspiratorial outlet Infowars. “They thought they would shut us down,” Jones said. “But that jury understood the truth and resisted the propaganda.” The decision from the jury is a partial ending to a years-long process that began in 2018 when Lewis and Heslin sued Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, which is Infowars’ parent.  Jones baselessly said in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 26 people were killed, that the incident was staged. Facing multiple lawsuits, Jones later acknowledged the shooting occurred. He testified in court this week that he now believed it to be “100% real.” But Jones failed to comply with court orders during the discovery process of the lawsuit. His failure to do so led to Heslin and Lewis winning default judgments judgements against Jones. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble ruled in October that Jones was legally responsible for inflicting emotional distress on Heslin and Lewis. Gamble also ruled that Jones was liable for defaming Heslin. Jones claimed in his testimony that a jury award of just $2 million would destroy him financially. But the accountant who is now in charge of overseeing Jones’ company Free Speech Systems, the parent of his conspiratorial media outlet Infowars, testified in bankruptcy court Wednesday that Jones withdrew about $62 million dollars from the company over 14 years, of which about $30 million was paid to the IRS. And the accountant testified that Infowars had received about $9 million in cryptocurrency donations and that “they went directly to Mr. Jones.” The decision to punish Jones in such terms also comes at a seismic moment in American society, where the lies and conspiracy theories have flourished in recent years. The jury’s decision, while far lower than what the plaintiffs’ attorneys had asked for, sends a message to those who propel lies into the public conversation, whether for political power or financial gain, that there can be consequences for such behavior. “Speech is free, but lies you have to pay for,” the Sandy Hook family attorneys argued to the jury during their opening statements and closing arguments. During the trial, Heslin and Lewis offered emotional testimony, telling the jury that the lies pushed by Jones stained the legacy of their son Jesse and tormented them for years. Fighting back tears at times, Heslin told the jury that Jones, through his conspiratorial media organization Infowars, “tarnished the honor and legacy” of his son. Heslin said that he couldn’t “even begin to describe the last nine-and-a-half years of hell” he has endured because of Jones, and described in detail how he fears for the safety of himself and his family. In a remarkable moment in court, Lewis spoke directly to Jones, saying she wanted to address him to his face. “Jesse was real,” Lewis told Jones. “I’m a real mom.” Lewis told the jury she feels monetary damages were appropriate in the case because she doesn’t believe Jones would otherwise ever stop his behavior. “There has not been a sincere apology,” she said. “But if there was, ever, I liken it to being in a car accident and you run over someone and cause tremendous bodily damage and you look at that person lying on the ground and say, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m not accountable for any of the damage I just caused. But I’m sorry.’ That’s how I see it.” Lewis also reflected on what it meant that  the trial had to ever take place. “It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this,” Lewis told Jones. “That we have to implore you — not just implore you, punish you — to get you to stop lying…It is surreal what is going on in here.” The trial in Texas is one of three that is expected to play out over the next couple of months. A different group of Sandy Hook families sued Jones in Connecticut. Those families also won a default judgment against Jones and a trial was scheduled to begin in September. But jury selection was suspended the same day it started earlier this week and the trial could be delayed because of a bankruptcy filing from Free Speech Systems. Attorneys representing some Sandy Hook families have accused Jones of having drained Free Speech Systems of assets in recent years as part of an effort to protect himself from potential judgments he may be ordered to pay. One of the attorneys, Avi Moshenberg, told CNN on Tuesday that the bankruptcy filing made by Free Speech Systems indicated that $62 million in assets had been withdrawn from the company in 2021 and 2022. “If you look at the bankruptcy filing, leading up to the declaration of bankruptcy, Alex Jones, the sole owner [of Free Speech Systems], took $62 million in draws in 2021 and 2022,” Moshenberg told CNN. “Just straight up draws. That’s why the company has few assets.” – CNN’s Sonia Moghe contributed reporting.

In a blog post on the company’s website, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the “deterioration of the macro environment” — notably decades-high inflation coupled with a cryptocurrency crash — has reduced the company’s customer trading activity and assets under custody.   In its second-quarter earnings report, also released Tuesday, the company showed a 44% drop in revenue from a year ago. Robinhood’s monthly active users in June decreased by more than 7 million, or 34%, and that assets under custody have dropped by more than $37 billion, or 37%, from the second quarter of last year. The company’s staffing and operations approach, he added, was tailored for a continuation of the high-growth crypto boom of the pandemic era.  “Last year, we staffed many of our operations functions under the assumption that the heightened retail engagement we had been seeing with the stock and crypto markets in the COVID era would persist into 2022,” Tenev wrote in a message to employees. “In this new environment, we are operating with more staffing than appropriate.”  He added: ” As CEO, I approved and took responsibility for our ambitious staffing trajectory – this is on me.” The layoffs will affect employees across all functions of the company, with operations, marketing and program management positions being the hardest hit, he said. The company planned to notify all employees via email and Slack on Tuesday with their status as well as resources if they were affected. Separately on Tuesday, the New York State Department of Financial Services fined Robinhood’s cryptocurrency arm $30 million for allegedly violating reporting requirements related to anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations. “As its business grew, Robinhood Crypto failed to invest the proper resources and attention to develop and maintain a culture of compliance – a failure that resulted in significant violations of the department’s anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations,” Adrienne A. Harris, the department’s superintendent said in a statement.",,York State Department Of Financial Services,"CYBER_ATTACK,2197;CYBER_ATTACK,2453;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2197;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2453;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,2197;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,2453;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2197;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2453;ECON_IPO,1168;ECON_IPO,1234;ECON_INFLATION,544;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,544;WB_442_INFLATION,544;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SUPERINTENDENT,2518;TAX_FNCACT_SUPERINTENDENT,2518;AFFECT,170;AFFECT,1705;GENERAL_HEALTH,1095;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1095;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1095;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1095;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1095;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1095;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1095;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1095;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,184;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1492;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1715;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1889;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,1427;ECON_EARNINGSREPORT,701;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1397;ECON_BITCOIN,574;ECON_BITCOIN,2089;WB_698_TRADE,629;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,24;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2228;MEDIA_SOCIAL,403;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,447;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1592;ARREST,661;ARREST,882;USPEC_POLICY1,2209;USPEC_POLICY1,2465;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,506;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1517;",California;New York;Menlo Park
658,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/blinken-africa-policy/,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday drew firm distinctions between the United States and Russia as he sought to make the case that the US is the better partner for countries in Africa. In a speech about the Biden administration’s “strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa,” delivered in Pretoria, South Africa, the top US diplomat argued that “the United States and African nations can’t achieve any of our shared priorities – whether that’s recovering from the pandemic, creating broad-based economic opportunities, addressing the climate crisis, expanding energy access, revitalizing democracies, or strengthening the free and open international order – we can’t do any of that if we don’t work together as equal partners.” “Our strategy is rooted in the recognition that Sub-Saharan Africa is a major geopolitical force – one that shaped our past, is shaping our present, and will shape our future,” Blinken said. Blinken’s visit to the continent – with stops in South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Rwanda – and pitch for US partnership there comes as Moscow has sought to step up its influence in Africa amid isolation from Europe over its war in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov traveled to Ethiopia, Uganda, the Republic of Congo, and Egypt at the end of July. Blinken said his visit was not about countering Russia’s influence on the continent, telling South Africa’s “eNCA” that the US’ “focus is not on saying to friends, partners: you have to choose.” “Our focus is on providing a choice,” he said. However, his speech included a number of examples calling out Moscow for its negative influence on the continent, specifically as it relates to the war in Ukraine, and the accompanying 17-page strategy document released by the White House makes explicit reference to Russia’s role there. “Russia views the region as a permissive environment for parastatals and private military companies, often fomenting instability for strategic and financial benefit. Russia uses its security and economic ties, as well as disinformation, to undercut Africans’ principled opposition to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine and related human rights abuses,” that document says. In his speech Monday, Blinken made reference to the Wagner Group, a mercenary group backed by Moscow, and its negative impact in nations throughout Africa. “History shows that strong democracies tend to be more stable and less prone to conflict, but that poor governance, exclusion, and corruption inherent in weak democracies makes them more vulnerable to extremist movements as well as to foreign interference,” he said. “That includes the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, which exploits instability to pillage resources and commit abuses with impunity, as we’ve seen in Mali and the Central African Republic.” “The United States recognizes African countries face real security concerns, and that countless communities are afflicted by immense scourges of terrorism and violence,” he continued. “But the answer to these problems is not Wagner. It’s not any other mercenary group.” He also sought to emphasize the global impact on food insecurity of Russia’s war – a point repeatedly made by the Biden administration as it tries to counter Russian propaganda claiming Kyiv and the West are to blame. Last week, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield delivered a speech in Ghana outlining in detail Moscow’s culpability for adding to the food crisis. For months, tons of Ukrainian grain was unable to reach international markets due a Russian blockade of major ports on the Black Sea. Only in recent weeks have ships been able begun to safely transit through the waterway. However, officials have said unblocking the ports alone is not sufficient to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing war. “Even before President Putin launched his full invasion, 193 million people around the world were in need of humanitarian food assistance. The World Bank believes Russia’s invasion could add another 40 million people to this unprecedented number. Most are in Africa,” Blinken said. “The United States is there for African countries in this unprecedented crisis, because that’s what partners do for each other,” he said.

24,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/asia/nancy-pelosi-asia-trip-singapore-intl-hnk/,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several other Congress members visited Singapore on Monday, their first official stop in a high-profile Asia tour that has attracted international attention over speculation she may visit Taiwan. The delegation started their two-day visit to the city-state by meeting Singaporean President Halimah Yacob, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. During the meeting, they discussed US-Singapore cooperation on a number of issues, including the climate crisis and economic development, according to the statement. It added that Lee “highlighted the importance of stable US-China relations for regional peace and security.” Pelosi is scheduled to attend a cocktail reception held by the American Chamber of Commerce in the city-state later Monday.  Before arriving in the Indo-Pacific, Pelosi’s delegation stopped by Hawaii, according to a statement from her office on Sunday. The delegation also plans to visit Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, where high-level meetings would be held to address “shared interests,” including trade, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, according to Pelosi’s office. The statement and Pelosi’s public itinerary made no mention of Taiwan, but a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official told CNN on Monday that she is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia. It is unclear when exactly Pelosi will land in Taipei.  The stop – the first for a US House speaker in 25 years – comes at a time when US-China relations are already at a low point. The Taiwanese official added that she is expected to stay in Taiwan overnight.  The US official added that Defense Department officials are working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe.  Speculation had swirled for weeks that Pelosi, who is second in the line of presidential succession behind the vice president, might have been planning to visit the self-governing democratic island. China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory – despite never having controlled it – has repeatedly warned against Pelosi visiting the island, vowing to take “resolute and forceful measures” if the trip goes ahead.  Some US officials are worried that the reported visit would be met with a military response from China, potentially triggering the worst cross-strait crisis in decades. During a phone call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last Thursday, Xi warned the US not to “play with fire” on the Taiwan issue – though neither side confirmed if Pelosi’s reported plans were discussed. Preparation for the call predated reports of the possible trip. When asked about Pelosi’s possible visit on Monday, Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang did not confirm whether she might stop there and reiterated that Taipei welcomes foreign guests. “The government warmly welcomes any foreign VIP friends to visit our country,” Su told reporters. Traveling alongside Pelosi as part of the Congressional delegation are Chairman Gregory Meeks (Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Chairman Mark Takano (Chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs), Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Congressman Andy Kim. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

158,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/massachusetts-wrong-suspect-arrest-lawsuit-reaj/,"A Black man in Massachusetts says he was wrongly arrested by police who were looking for a White man, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the US District Court of Massachusetts.      Donovan Johnson says officers with the Arlington Police Department “wrongfully stopped, searched, arrested, and assaulted,” him “with no legitimate basis for their conduct.”     Johnson is suing three officers along with the town of Arlington and asking for compensatory and punitive damages in a sum to be determined by a jury trial. Johnson argues that his fourth and fourteenth amendments were violated as a result of the police pursuit and arrest.      CNN has reached out to the Arlington Police Department for comment.    In response to the lawsuit, town officials announced Friday they had previously been made aware of Johnson’s allegations and hired an “outside, licensed private detective to conduct an investigation to determine” if the officers violated any policies. That investigation “found no evidence to support a claim of racial profiling or excessive use of force,” according to a news release on the town’s website.  “The investigator did find that officers violated some department policies, and as a result of the outside investigation, three officers were disciplined, one officer and the sergeant received mandatory re-training and the sergeant received remedial supervisor training. The third officer later left the department,” the release said. The town will review the allegations in the lawsuit and “intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations,” the release said. Johnson says he was walking home after work on February 10 of last year when a police officer who, according to the lawsuit, was chasing a White suspect, ran up to him.   According to the lawsuit, that officer, identified as Steven Conroy, yelled to “get the f**k on the floor,” the complaint said. The White suspect, identified in the lawsuit as Kyle T., dropped down but Johnson, who was “unaware of what was happening” didn’t, the suit says.   According to the lawsuit, Officer Conroy pointed his gun at Johnson, threw him to the ground and placed his knee on Johnson’s neck. The complaint also alleges Johnson was handcuffed and placed in the back of a police cruiser before he was released without charge.   And while Johnson was eventually let go once police acknowledged “that they had no basis for arresting and detaining” him, “his entire detention lasted approximately 45 minutes,” the suit said.      The lawsuit alleges that police officers ignored information that showed Johnson was not a suspect. In a statement, Johnson’s attorneys said, “this is a quintessential racial profiling case. The Arlington Police Department had no evidence that Mr. Johnson was involved in a crime, in fact to the contrary, witnesses informed the police that he was not involved. Yet, at the end of the day, Mr. Johnson was humiliated and physically violated.”    Days after the incident, the suit says, “Conroy prepared a police report stating that a connection between Mr. Johnson and,” Kyle T. “existed on the CopLink database, a tool that integrates various law enforcement databases.”     “However, there was no connection between Mr. Johnson and Mr. T on the CopLink database,” the suit said.     When reached by phone Thursday morning for a statement, Conroy told CNN, “no comment.”     About a month after the incident, the police department conducted an independent administrative review of Johnson’s arrest.    Conroy told investigators that he saw the suspect who appeared to be jogging with another person outside of the hotel. The second subject, Conroy said, was not following his verbal commands so “he reached out and grabbed him by the arm … so he could further investigate the situation,” the investigative report said.  The review concluded, “the Arlington Police Department Use of Force Policy and Procedure … appears to have been complied with” and later says investigators, “found no evidence to support (name redacted) claim that he had been racially profiled.”  The review also states that officers violated several department policies regarding arrests outside of their jurisdiction, proper method of handcuffing and evidence seizure. The review recommends “additional training” in these areas.  Four recommendations were also given regarding training, retraining and policy revisions, following the outside investigator’s probe, town officials said Friday. Those have been implemented, the news release said. “The Town of Arlington Police Department is committed to providing equal and fair justice to all its residents and visitors,” Town Manager Sandy Pooler and Police Chief Julie Flaherty said in the town’s news release. “It trains its staff to administer justice without regard to race and conducts ongoing training in diversity, equity and inclusion.” In a statement, one of Johnson’s attorneys, Mirian Albert of Lawyers for Civil Rights, said, “All people should feel safe in their own communities. Our client’s rights were violated within view of his own home. This is the type of police misconduct that fuels mistrust between communities of color and law enforcement.”   ",Donovan Johnson;Steven Conroy;Mirian Albert,Arlington Police Department;Arlington Police Department;Arlington Police Department;Arlington Police Department;Us District Court;Arlington Police Department Use Of Force;Cnn;Cnn,"TRIAL,126;TRIAL,795;TRIAL,869;TRIAL,1019;TRIAL,1144;TRIAL,1583;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2179;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2326;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2179;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2326;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,2179;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,2326;WB_2945_DATABASE,2179;WB_2945_DATABASE,2326;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2179;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2326;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MASSACHUSETTS,29;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MASSACHUSETTS,184;USPEC_POLICY1,2957;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,2957;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,1706;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,3400;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1850;ARREST,58;ARREST,295;SOC_GENERALCRIME,58;SOC_GENERALCRIME,295;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,58;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,295;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE_OFFICER,764;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,764;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,3444;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,3444;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,217;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,388;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1612;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,3164;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1520;WB_840_JUSTICE,1520;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1520;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1520;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1520;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1520;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1520;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,3427;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,466;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2228;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,3673;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,2228;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,3673;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,2228;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,3673;SECURITY_SERVICES,68;SECURITY_SERVICES,243;SECURITY_SERVICES,591;SECURITY_SERVICES,655;SECURITY_SERVICES,756;SECURITY_SERVICES,1332;SECURITY_SERVICES,1431;SECURITY_SERVICES,1603;SECURITY_SERVICES,1782;SECURITY_SERVICES,1908;SECURITY_SERVICES,2082;SECURITY_SERVICES,2479;SECURITY_SERVICES,2926;SECURITY_SERVICES,3595;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,68;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,243;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,591;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,655;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,756;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1332;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1431;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1603;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1782;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1908;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2082;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2479;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2926;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,3595;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,12;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,101;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,764;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,884;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1154;TAX_WEAPONS_GUN,1177;LEGISLATION,2216;LEGISLATION,3661;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2216;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3661;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,8;",Massachusetts

These are the fragrances that we wear daily and have elicited plenty of “Hey, what perfume are you wearing?” questions from passersby. From unisex fragrances to the perfect summer perfumes to colognes we can’t get enough of, discover our all-time favorite scents to wear. House of Bo Agua de Santos Eau de Parfum $290 at Saks 5th Avenue I’ve accumulated a collection of fragrances — a fragrance wardrobe, if you will — with some outstanding picks that will always be in my rotation, including this scent from House of Bo. The independent fragrance brand launched last year with three heavenly perfumes that celebrate natural ingredients, and Agua de Santos is the scent I reach for most often. It is fruity and floral with notes of mandarin and orange blossom, yet it’s grounded with a bit of musk. Beachy La Mar and woody Espiritu are just as lovely. Sometimes I’ll even layer two of the different scents. Plus, the marble-topped bottles are gorgeous and sculptural, which ties back to the brand’s appreciation of natural elements and is something to take into consideration when dropping nearly $300 on a fragrance — the bottles feel worthy of the hefty price tag. — Sophie Shaw, associate beauty editor Byredo Mojave Ghost Hair Perfume $80 at Nordstrom Byredo’s hair perfumes are my favorite fragrance hack. A few years ago I fell in love with Mojave Ghost, a moody, woody floral scent with notes of violet, sandalwood and amber. But at hundreds of dollars for a single bottle, I knew I couldn’t afford it. Then after some internet sleuthing I found these hair perfumes, which are available in lots of Byredo’s top-selling scents, and there was no going back. Ringing up at under $100, you just spritz it a few times in your hair and it lingers for literal hours. I’ve gotten countless compliments from strangers and friends alike, and so far this bottle has lasted me four years and counting. — Rachel Lubitz, senior lifestyle editor The Nue Co. Functional Fragrance $95 at The Nue Co. During the height of the pandemic, even when I was almost never leaving my home, I’d spritz this on nearly every day just for myself. As its name implies, this scent is meant to actually help provide a calming, functional effect as you wear it. My stress and anxiety levels were definitely higher during the pandemic, and I did find this smoky, woody scent to be very calming. — Hayley Saltzman, head of social Carolina Herrera Good Girl Eau de Parfum From $29 at Sephora Introducing my “going out” fragrance. This is the perfume that I use before going out on the town in NYC. My look is not complete without a pump of the perfume from the stiletto bottle. I only place a dab on my wrists and behind my ears and that’s strong enough to last me through the night. Believe it or not, I’ve had this fragrance for two years! A little goes a long way and it lasts for hours. If you’re into floral fragrances that last, I highly recommend splurging on Good Girl. — Sarai Thompson, social coordinator Burberry Her London Dream Eau de Parfum From $79 at Sephora My go-to scent is Burberry Her London Dream. It’s a very natural-smelling perfume with modern yet romantic notes without being too heavy. What I love most is that it’s so versatile — I can wear it to work, on a date night, during the winter and in the heat of the summer. It’s got a very fresh smell of lemon and ginger at the top, which is lovely. Plus, it comes with an option to personalize your bottle for free with up to three initials. — Emily McNutt, senior travel editor Givenchy Very Irresistible L’Eau En Rose Eau de Toilette $87.12 at Amazon I got this one when I was interning at a beauty magazine several years back, and I love how it embodies all things sophisticated and mature while also boasting a little playfulness from the rose scent. The rose-less version of Givenchy’s Very Irresistible is also, well, very irresistible, but I think rose is such an uplifting note, especially for warmer months. — Marissa Miller, production editor Maison Francis Kurkdjian Gentle Fluidity Silver $235 at Nordstrom This clean and crisp unisex fragrance has been in my usual rotation for a couple years — and somehow I’ve barely made a dent in the bottle despite using it weekly. Thanks to the strong scent, one spritz suffices for a whole day. The juniper berry gives it a bright and masculine tone, but it has an underlying sweetness that settles nicely while wearing the fragrance. — Sophie Shaw, associate beauty editor Duke Cannon Supply Co. Sawtooth Men’s Cologne $28.99 at Target I’ve been using this cologne for many years now because it’s affordable and great-smelling, and a little goes a long way. I use it every day, and a bottle will typically last me around a year. It’s aromatic, with notes of cedar and amber, and I’ve received several compliments about how good it smells from friends and strangers alike. This will be my go-to fragrance until they stop producing it. — Daniel Toy, copy editor Diptyque Philosykos Eau de Toilette From $108 at Nordstrom On a very hot day in New York a few years ago, I decided to walk through the first floor of Bloomingdale’s from one avenue to another so I could get a quick blast of AC. I’m not usually a perfume person, but as I wasn’t in a rush, I stopped to smell a few of the department store’s fragrance offerings that were in my path. That’s when I happened upon this Diptyque Paris Philosykos Eau de Toilette and thought, “I need this.” A woody ode to the fig tree, according to the brand, it was and still is my favorite smell ever. — Chelsea Stone, senior editor Le Labo Santal 33 Eau de Parfum From $88 at Nordstrom I know this scent is viewed as somewhat basic and ubiquitous at this point, but in my opinion, there’s a reason it’s so popular. This is the scent I wear on a daily basis, and I don’t think I’ll ever get sick of it. I find it to be subtle and light enough for daily wear yet smoky and woody enough to carry into the evening. I wear it across seasons, events, for pretty much anything, and even with daily use the bottle has lasted me a very long time. I’ve tried some more affordable “dupes,” but nothing seems to hit quite the same note, or last quite as long, as the original. — Hayley Saltzman, head of social﻿ Katy Perry Killer Queen Eau de Parfum $35.84 at Amazon I am a sucker for celebrity perfumes (shout out to Britney Spears’ Curious being my go-to in middle school). One perfume I constantly get complimented on is Katy Perry’s Killer Queen. Warning: It is intense! You need barely a full spritz for it to last the entire day. While it has floral top notes, I’d categorize this in more of a musky scent — a must for fall. The bottle alone is so unique, and I love having it out on display. — Lindsey Smith, associate editor Dior Miss Dior Eau de Parfum From $51 at Sephora This classic floral fragrance is one of my favorites for spring and summertime. It has notes of lily-of-the-valley and peony with a powdery finish that is soft and light rather than overly sweet or headache-inducing. I was lucky enough to snag a custom engraved bottle at a Miss Dior pop-up in New York City last summer, which will become a cute keepsake once I’m finished with the fragrance. — Sophie Shaw, associate beauty editor Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt Eau de Parfum From $29 at Sephora For when I’m feeling fancy (or at least want to smell fancy), I always grab this bottle from Maison Louis Marie. Housed in a simple, chic bottle reminiscent of ones my grandma used to have on her vanity, it has notes of sandalwood, vetiver and amber, making it one of the most intoxicating earthy floral perfumes I’ve ever smelled. — Rachel Lubitz, senior lifestyle editor Oribe Côte d’Azur Eau de Parfum $125 at Oribe and Nordstrom I’ve written many times about how much I love Oribe’s hair products, but one of the things I love most about the products is actually the scent. This fragrance brings Oribe’s signature scent to perfume form, and it’s the perfect scent for a special occasion or a night out. It has a bright, citrusy note without being too summery or sweet, and you instantly feel a bit more glamorous or dressed up while wearing it. — Hayley Saltzman, head of social﻿ Juicy Couture Viva la Juicy Eau de Parfum From $62 at Amazon I am a Juicy Couture stan till I die. Even though it evokes all the 2008 vibes, Viva La Juicy is perhaps the most well-rounded scent I own. I actually find it so seductive that I’ll usually only wear it while going out instead of in professional settings. I’ve bought nearly every Juicy Couture perfume on the market, and all that’s left to get is a matching velour tracksuit. — Marissa Miller, production editor Nest Indigo Travel Spray $28 at Nest This Nest travel spray is a new essential for me. Its scent lasts for hours and is guaranteed to get you compliments. It has a fruity and fresh smell that I tend to gravitate toward, so I make sure to take this with me anywhere I go! — Tyler Holender, social media intern Glossier You Eau de Parfum $60 at Glossier This perfume is slightly subtler than many of the others I typically wear, and it’s a light, bright note for summer or daytime activities. This perfume is supposed to “melt into skin” and “smell a bit different on everyone,” so I can’t make assumptions about how it smells on others, but the fact that it’s meant to smell different on each person makes it feel unique and customized. — Hayley Saltzman, head of social﻿ Burberry Brit Sheer Eau de Toilette From $60 at Sephora My absolute favorite perfume is Burberry Brit Sheer. I’ve been wearing it for years and it’s the one fragrance I always reach for. It’s subtle and light, but the scent lasts for a long time. I love it so much I bought it in three different sizes so I always have it on me. — Lindsey Smith, associate editor Fragonard Belle Chérie Perfume From $70 at Fragonard I found this fragrance at a perfume factory in France and it is truly one of a kind. Fragonard’s Belle Chérie is a perfect combination of floral, fruity and woodsy scents. I’d recommend it for an all-day wear because I rarely need to reapply. The bottle lasts me about a year! — Savannah Born, editorial intern Summer Fridays Fragrance Trio Roll-On Perfume Oils $27 at Summer Fridays This is my go-to travel perfume, not only because it comes with a super-tiny, transportable roller ball applicator but because the scent, along with the Coconut Wave scent included in the pack, instantly puts me in the vacation mood. I love a good vanilla scent (going back as far as Vanilla Lace from Victoria’s Secret), and this feels like a more grown-up version of that cloyingly sweet scent. — Hayley Saltzman, head of social﻿",Maison Francis Kurkdjian;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Hayley Saltzman;Sarai Thompson;Sarai Thompson;Tyler Holender;Parfum Hayley Saltzman;Parfum Hayley Saltzman;Parfum Hayley Saltzman;Parfum Sarai Thompson;Parfum Emily Mcnutt;Parfum Rachel Lubitz;Parfum Sophie Shaw;Parfum Sophie Shaw;Emily Mcnutt;Emily Mcnutt;Rachel Lubitz;Rachel Lubitz;Rachel Lubitz;Rachel Lubitz;Maison Louis Marie;Maison Louis Marie;Marissa Miller;Marissa Miller;Marissa Miller;Marissa Miller;Parfum Marissa Miller;Sophie Shaw;Sophie Shaw;Sophie Shaw;Sophie Shaw;Sophie Shaw;Sophie Shaw;Lindsey Smith;Lindsey Smith;Lindsey Smith;Lindsey Smith,Bloomingdale;Nue Co;Nue Co;Nordstrom;Nordstrom;Nordstrom;Nordstrom;Nordstrom;Victoria Secret;Duke Cannon Supply Co,"EDUCATION,6860;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6860;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6860;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,9570;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,9570;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,9570;KILL,8869;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,8869;TAX_FNCACT_EDITORS,246;TAX_WORLDFISH_SUCKER,6771;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,6723;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,6932;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,4441;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,4441;WB_2937_SILVER,4412;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,4412;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,4412;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,4412;TAX_WORLDFISH_DAB,2975;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1424;TAX_ETHNICITY_SANTAL,6027;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SANTAL,6027;GENERAL_HEALTH,2307;GENERAL_HEALTH,2586;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2307;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2586;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2307;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2586;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2307;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2586;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2307;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2586;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2307;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2586;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2307;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2586;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2307;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2586;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,1475;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,2196;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,3845;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,4343;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,4842;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,5344;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,5987;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,7228;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,7723;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,8200;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,9239;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,10441;TAX_FNCACT_INTERN,9577;TAX_FNCACT_INTERN,10844;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_MIDDLE_SCHOOL,6860;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4237;TAX_FNCACT_KILLER,6717;TAX_FNCACT_KILLER,6926;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,5586;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2536;MEDIA_MSM,3997;TAX_FNCACT_COPY_EDITOR,5344;AFFECT,1136;AFFECT,6252;AFFECT,9010;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MOJAVE,1509;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MOJAVE,1644;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,3283;MEDIA_SOCIAL,9570;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,9570;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,9570;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,9570;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MANDARIN,1016;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3622;",New York;France
344,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/wisconsin-tubing-stabbing-suspect-charged-with-homicide/,"The suspect accused of stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death and injuring four others while they were tubing in a Wisconsin river Saturday appeared in criminal court Monday, charged with intentional homicide. Nicolae Miu, 52, has been charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide and four counts of first-degree intentional attempted homicide, according to court records. Jeremiah Harrelson, a state public defender at the hearing, said Miu was tubing on the river with his wife and friends when they were separated as he was searching for a lost cellphone.  The attack stemmed from an “unanticipated random encounter” between Miu and the victims, Harrelson said. Miu said he acted in “self-defense,” the complaint said.  The complaint states Miu had brandished a knife when two females confronted him before a physical altercation broke out. One victim told investigators she was punched by Miu in the face, which gave way to a physical struggle as the group proceeded to push Miu, who fell into the water after he was punched by a male. Miu, who repeatedly called the attack “self-defense,” told Brandie Hart, a lieutenant with St. Croix County court, he approached the group while searching for the cellphone with his snorkeling gear to ask if they had seen the device. He said they started insulting him, took his snorkel gear, threw it into the river and attempted to pull his pants down, according to the complaint. Miu said he doesn’t remember anything after people hit him and got on top of him until he ran back to his wife and friends, according to the complaint. Miu was arrested about an hour and half after the attack as he was exiting the river downstream. The 17-year-old who died in the stabbing was identified in a statement by his family to CNN affiliate KARE as Isaac Shuman. “Isaac entered every room with a big smile, infectiously positive aura and lifted everyone around him up,” the statement reads. “He had an incredibly bright future ahead of him, and we are all heartbroken and devastated beyond words that his future has been tragically and senselessly cut short.” Miu’s next court appearance is scheduled for August 5, according to court records.",Jeremiah Harrelson;Brandie Hart;Nicolae Miu;Isaac Shuman,Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,829;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,829;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,171;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1065;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,62;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_LIEUTENANT,1321;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT,1321;WB_137_WATER,1201;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1046;TRIAL,27;KILL,604;KILL,683;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,604;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,683;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,604;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,683;SOC_GENERALCRIME,199;SOC_GENERALCRIME,264;ARREST,1789;WOUND,73;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLIC_DEFENDER,442;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,442;WB_840_JUSTICE,442;WB_942_ACCESS_TO_JUSTICE,442;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,627;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,706;",Wisconsin River;Wisconsin
110,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/business/boeing-defense-plants-strike-averted/,"A union representing nearly 2,500 employees at three Boeing defense locations in the St. Louis area said on Saturday they will vote on the company’s revised contract offer, canceling a strike that was set to start early Monday. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said an overnight bargaining session had led to the new Boeing offer and workers will vote Wednesday on whether to accept it. Under the new contract offer, employees can opt to receive an $8,000 lump sum payment — minus tax withholdings — upon ratification or can choose to have the entire amount deposited in a 401(k) plan. The company is dropping its revised 401(k) match proposal. Boeing said in a statement Saturday “this new offer builds on our previous strong, highly competitive one and directly addresses the issues raised by our employees. We are hopeful they will vote yes on Wednesday.” The tentative deal does not necessarily mean that the risk of a strike is over. A number of companies have reached deals with union leadership, only to see rank-and-file workers reject the proposed contract, forcing a strike. That’s what happened at John Deere where 10,000 members of the United Auto Workers union went on strike in October after rejecting a tentative deal.  They stayed on strike for five weeks, rejecting another tentative agreement along the way, before voting in favor of a third agreement and returning to work. Union members at the three Boeing defense plants overwhelmingly rejected the previous offer from the company a week ago. Workers at the three plants in Missouri and Illinois build the F-15, F-18, T-7A trainer, and the MQ-25 unmanned refueler. Boeing said on July 24 it was activating a contingency plan in the event of a strike. But CEO Dave Calhoun had told investors during a conference call this week that delays in deliveries to military customers would occur if there was a strike. The standoff began after the union had criticized Boeing’s 401(k) payments in the contract and workers rejected the offer. “Boeing previously took away a pension from our members, and now the company is unwilling to adequately compensate our members’ 401(k) plan,” the union said on July 24. Boeing’s earlier 401(k) offer on Sunday included a company match of workers contributions up to 10% of workers’ salaries along with an automatic contribution of 2% for 2023 and 2024. Boeing had also offered a $3,000 ratification bonus. Boeing currently provides a 4% company contribution and a 75% match on the first 8% of an employee contribution. Boeing has posted deep losses each of the last three years, with net losses topping $18 billion since the start of 2019. But those losses were primarily related to its commercial aircraft business, which has been buffeted by the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that started in March of 2019 following two fatal crashes, as well as a sharp drop in demand for air travel caused by the pandemic. The company’s defense, space and security business unit posted a $1.5 billion profit each of the last two years. But Boeing reported a loss of $929 million in its defense business in the first quarter this year after a number of special charges, including a $660 million charge related to its refurbishment of two 747 jets to be used as the new Air Force Ones. Boeing posted a narrow $71 million profit in the second quarter. – CNN Business’ Chris Isidore contributed to this report",Dave Calhoun;John Deere,Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;Boeing;International Association Of Machinists;John Deere;Aerospace Workers,"RETIREMENT,2096;ECON_UNIONS,1071;ECON_TAXATION,556;USPEC_POLICY1,556;EPU_POLICY_TAX,556;EPU_CATS_TAXES,556;TAX_FNCACT_MACHINISTS,304;DELAY,213;TAX_FNCACT_TRAINER,1669;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2966;GENERAL_HEALTH,2924;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2924;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2924;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2924;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2924;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2924;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2924;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2924;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,2324;NEGOTIATIONS,353;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2894;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3256;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,79;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,491;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,881;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1511;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1609;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2737;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2975;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3091;MILITARY,3262;TAX_FNCACT_UNION_MEMBERS,1480;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1786;RATIFY,595;RATIFY,2434;WB_699_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT,1755;WB_1707_CONTINGENCY_PLANNING,1755;WB_820_DISASTER_RISK_MANAGEMENT,1755;WB_1705_DISASTER_PREPAREDNESS,1755;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEE,2537;PROTEST,1258;PROTEST,1325;STRIKE,1258;STRIKE,1325;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,324;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,403;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1105;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1237;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1593;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,2036;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,2291;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1865;",Missouri;Illinois;Washington
82,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/sport/deshaun-watson-nfl-suspension-decision-spt-intl/,"Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has been suspended for six games without pay for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy for his “predatory conduct” in private meetings with massage therapists, according to a ruling by a judge jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association. “Although this is the most significant punishment ever imposed on an NFL player for allegations of non-violent sexual conduct, Mr. Watson’s pattern of conduct is more egregious than any before reviewed by the NFL,” former federal judge Sue L. Robinson wrote in the 16-page ruling. The six-game suspension is well below the NFL’s request that Watson be suspended for at least the entire 17-game season and postseason. In her ruling, Robinson critiqued the NFL for asking for an unprecedented full-season suspension which would be far lengthier than other players accused of nonviolent sexual conduct. “While it may be entirely appropriate to more severely discipline players for nonviolent sexual conduct, I do not believe it is appropriate to do so without notice of the extraordinary change this position portends for the NFL and its players,” she wrote. Either the NFL or the NFLPA can now appeal to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in writing within three business days, according to their collective bargaining agreement. Goodell or his designee “will issue a written decision that will constitute full, final and complete disposition of the dispute and will be binding upon the player,” per the agreement. In a statement, the NFL praised Robinson’s “diligence and professionalism” in the process and said it is reviewing its next steps. On Sunday night, the NFLPA and Watson released a joint statement saying they will not appeal regardless of the decision and asked the NFL to do the same. The ruling comes after a number of women who worked as massage therapists filed lawsuits against Watson alleging sexual assault or misconduct during massage sessions. A total of 24 women sued the quarterback, and all but one of the cases has since been settled, according to the plaintiffs’ attorney Tony Buzbee. Watson, a three-time Pro Bowler, did not play last season while a member of the Houston Texans because of a trade demand as well as the investigations into these allegations. He has repeatedly denied the allegations against him and said he has no regrets about any of his actions. In March, a grand jury in Harris County, Texas, declined to charge Watson over allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct after determining there was not enough evidence to charge him with a crime. The incidents were described as “stemming from massage therapy sessions,” according to a statement on the NFL website. Days later, the Browns traded three first-round picks for Watson and then signed him to a 5-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history. Watson will not be paid during his suspension, but the Browns structured his new contract so his base salary is $690,000 his first year and then $46 million for each of the next four years. Watson’s attorney Rusty Hardin told CNN he will not comment until after the NFL decides whether to appeal. Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam issued a statement Monday saying Watson and his representatives have followed the process laid out by the league and players association. “We respect Judge Robinson’s decision, and at the same time, empathize and understand that there have been many individuals triggered throughout this process,” the Haslams said. “We know Deshaun is remorseful that this situation has caused much heartache to many and he will continue the work needed to show who he is on and off the field, and we will continue to support him.” Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said he respects the judge’s opinion, but he has not read the entire ruling. He gave his support to Watson, who the coach said will speak to the media later. “I am going to remain (with) what we have said all along about Deshaun the person. I would mention – Deshaun has said it – that he is working to be the best version of himself. He is committed to that,” Stefanski said. “He said that publicly, he said that privately and I believe that.” CNN has reached out to the players’ union for comment. Judge criticizes NFL for reacting to public outcry Robinson’s ruling comes after she held hearings in the case for three days in late June and reviewed the NFL’s 215-page investigative report on Watson’s case, which included testimony from four of the massage therapists. The ruling states the NFL proved by a preponderance of the evidence Watson violated three aspects of the league’s personal conduct policy: sexual assault, as defined by the NFL; conduct that poses a genuine danger to the safety and well-being of another person; and conduct that undermines or puts at risk the integrity of the NFL. Robinson also expressed skepticism of Watson’s denial of wrongdoing. “It is difficult to give weight to a complete denial when weighed against the credible testimony of the investigators who interviewed the therapists and other third parties,” she wrote. The most common discipline for domestic or gendered violence and sexual acts is a six-game suspension, and prior cases involving non-violent sexual assault, such as with Watson, resulted in at most a three-game suspension, Robinson wrote. She said the league appears to be basing its disciplinary decisions on public outcry, noting the case of former running back Ray Rice. In 2014, the NFL initially suspended Rice for two games for violating the league’s domestic violence policy, but then extended that suspension indefinitely after TMZ Sports released video of the incident; a decision that was ultimately overturned by an arbitrator. “Just as the NFL responded to violent conduct after a public outcry, so it seems the NFL is responding to yet another public outcry about Mr. Watson’s conduct,” Robinson wrote. “Here, the NFL is attempting to impose a more dramatic shift in its culture without the benefit of fair notice to – and consistency of consequence for – those in the NFL subject to the Policy.” Robinson also mandated Watson limit his massage therapy to team-directed sessions and therapists for the rest of his career. Last month, 30 women who have made or intended to make claims against the Texans organization over Watson’s alleged misconduct settled their claims, according to a statement from Buzbee and the Texans’ ownership. On Monday, Buzbee declined to comment on the NFL’s discipline. “I’ve said in the beginning that the civil process and the NFL’s disciplinary process are very different,” he said in a statement. “My role was to advance the cause of my clients, in civil court – nothing more. I’ve done that. I am extremely proud of these women and our legal team’s efforts.” CNN’s Homero De la Fuente contributed to this report.

51,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/opinions/iran-nuclear-talks-united-states-diplomacy-miller/,"Editor’s Note: Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of “The End of Greatness: Why America Can’t Have (and Doesn’t Want) Another Great President.” Miller was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. Indirect negotiations between the US and Iran have once again resumed in Vienna, in what is being described as a last-ditch effort to close an Iran nuclear deal.  Frustrated by the snail-like pace of the talks, the Biden administration has repeatedly imposed deadlines in the past. In July 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned talks “cannot go on indefinitely.” Later that year, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan predicted the deadline for the Iran talks would come “within weeks.” Even President Joe Biden, who rarely weighs in on the negotiations, admitted last month that the US wouldn’t “wait forever” for Iran to respond to the US proposal. And yet after a year and half, there is little to show for all these rounds of negotiations. So why not pull the plug? If Iran is stalling, or if the negotiations lead to a bad deal, what’s the purpose of continuing – especially if the regime is using this time to ramp up its nuclear program?   Before the Biden administration, and potentially its European partners, decide to call it quits, here are several factors to be considered.  First, however unlikely the chances of a successful negotiation, they’re not zero. Why preemptively take the US out of the game? We saw the results of such an approach in 2018 when the Trump administration unilaterally walked away from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and resorted to a campaign formally deemed as “maximum pressure.” Iran found a way – at great cost to its own economy – to cope with economic sanctions, secure support from Russia and China and ramp up its nuclear program. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran is now approaching the point where it has enough fissile material enriched to near weapons-grade for a nuclear weapon. Some argue that maximum pressure was eroding Iran’s currency reserves, and had it continued it would have had an impact on Iran’s behavior in negotiations. Others claim former President Donald Trump’s approach lacked a compelling military option to instill fear in Tehran of being attacked.  But there’s no reason to believe that either of these pressure tactics – absent incentives – would fundamentally alter Iran’s calculations. Indeed, having spent decades involved in Middle East negotiations, I’ve yet to encounter one where a party gives up some fundamental interest or agrees to a deal through pressure alone.  Second, walking away from the negotiating table would impact America’s image and credibility. Negotiating with Iran is not just an effort to preempt a regional crisis due to Tehran’s unchecked nuclear ambitions – it’s also a political-diplomatic game of gotcha. In short, who takes the hit for ending the negotiations is part and parcel of any administration’s calculations.  At least one of Iran’s arguments – that the US can’t be trusted to maintain its commitments from one administration to another – is likely to be well received, especially if the US pulls out (again), this time from the negotiating table.  Nor is it by any means a certainty that much of the international community will side with Washington should it break off the negotiations. Indeed, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated, the enthusiasm for sanctioning other countries is not widely shared by much of the world. Indeed, two-thirds of the world’s population live in countries that haven’t joined in sanctions against Russia.  Iran has deep ties to Russia and China – and key Gulf states, like the United Arab Emirates, already worried about their security in the event of a US-Iranian confrontation, are hedging their bets by enhancing their contacts with Iran.   Third, just because the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is no longer viable doesn’t mean that all diplomatic efforts need to come to an end. Admittedly any alternative to the 2015 deal faces perhaps even longer odds.  The administration thought it might embrace a “longer and stronger” accord that would have toughened up restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program. But just negotiating the original deal was an extraordinarily heavy lift, and it’s doubtful Iran would have agreed without much more for its side. Others have envisioned an interim agreement, as a possible confidence-building measure – accepting some restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions.  It’s hard to imagine either of these working at the moment. But we could be nearing the end of all diplomatic efforts to deal with the Iran nuclear issue. And while Iran may be the roadblock now standing in the way of an agreement, the US should not be the party that is directly responsible for hanging a “closed for the season” sign on a diplomatic end game.   Four, the alternative to a flawed negotiating process is far worse. It would be nice to imagine that in the absence of any accord, everyone would behave in ways that would avoid a crisis. Through deterrence, risk aversion and common sense, Iran would keep its nuclear program below some red line – thus avoiding military action by Israel or the US.  But what is that red line? There’s zero trust and confidence between Iran and the West – and in the absence of the monitoring provisions contained in the original nuclear deal, the US and Israel would rightly assume the worst about Iran’s nuclear program. However imperfect JCPOA may have been, as an internationally recognized agreement that restricted Iran’s nuclear program, it gave those in Israel, Iran and the US, who see the dangers inherent in escalation, an argument still to pursue diplomacy. Without an accord of some kind, the field will be open to a range of non-diplomatic measures. Invariably, the focus will turn, and already has to a certain extent, to a proverbial plan B – a mix of sanctions, political pressure and military deterrence. Only by persuading Iran that such an option exists and that the US will use it, the argument goes, can Iran’s nuclear program be deterred and can Iran be induced to negotiate in good faith.   Indeed, those who argue in favor of such an approach don’t necessarily recommend scuttling diplomacy. But it’s hard to imagine serious negotiations occurring in an environment of threats and pressure.  Now with Russia threatening a long war in Ukraine and China eyeing Taiwan amid rising Sino-US tensions, is that where the Biden administration wants to go? At best, even a successful military option against Iran’s nuclear sites would not guarantee an end to Iran’s nuclear program. It might even act as an incentive to reconstitute one at a faster pace – and with nuclear weapons as the goal.  To paraphrase former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on democracy, when it comes to constraining Iran’s nuclear program, diplomacy is the worst of all options except for all the others. There’s no doubt that pressure of various kinds is critically important in any negotiation – and especially with Iran. But pressure alone will not work. As frustrating as it may be, shutting the door on negotiations with Iran has few advantages, especially when International Crisis Group’s Iran Project Director Ali Vaez says the alternative may well be an “Iranian bomb or bombing Iran.” ",Winston Churchill;Donald Trump;Antony Blinken;Aaron David Miller;Ali Vaez;Joe Biden,International Crisis Group Iran;Carnegie Endowment For International Peace;International Atomic Energy Agency;National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan;Cnn,"LEADER,211;LEADER,910;LEADER,2373;",Taiwan;Tehran;Iran;United Arab Emirates;Israel;Carnegie Endowment For International Peace;Vienna;America;Washington;Russia;Ukraine;Iranian;British;China

554,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/tennessee-primary-5th-district/,"Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles will win the Republican nomination in Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District, CNN projects. The newly drawn district attracted a crowded field of candidates vying to represent part of the Nashville area. Ogles, an entrepreneur, will defeat state House Speaker Beth Harwell and retired Brig. Gen. Kurt Winstead.   Tennessee’s new congressional map split Davidson county, home to Nashville, into three separate districts, likely shifting the state’s delegation from seven Republicans and two Democrats to eight Republicans and one Democrat.  Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, who currently represents the Nashville-anchored 5th District seat as it is currently drawn, cited the new map when he announced he wouldn’t be seeking another term. Ogles, whose campaign is backed by outside super political action committees including the USA Freedom Fund and Americans for Prosperity, received criticism over where his support comes from – though Winstead and Harwell have outraised the field, according to FEC filings. Ahead of the primary election, Harwell told a local outlet in a statement, “It’s clear if Andy Ogles wins, he will be controlled by the DC swamp.”   “He owes everything to them, and I don’t think that’s right for the people of middle Tennessee,” she said. For his part, while Ogles said that while, “of course you can’t coordinate, you can’t communicate,” his campaign made a strategic decision to encourage outside support. “We firewalled off some of our donors away from the campaign to go run positive ads… so there’s been radio and there’s been mailers, there’s been doors knocked that I have not been able to control because the campaign wasn’t doing it,” Ogles told Nashville area radio host Michael Delgiorno on SuperTalk 99.7 WTN. He said that strategy allowed him and his campaign to focus more on the “grassroots” effort in Tennessee. Still, the field was less crowded than it was earlier this year, after the Tennessee Republican Party voted to boot three candidates from its primary ballot for the district – including Trump-endorsed hopeful Morgan Ortagus. That decision came after state GOP officials agreed to review challenges to the three candidates that raised questions about their Republican bonafides, including whether they had voted in three of the last four Republican primaries, as required by the state party’s bylaws. State Sen. Heidi Campbell ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. She has raised significantly less than the leading GOP candidates, per FEC reports.

449,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/asia/us-defend-philippines-south-china-sea-blinken-hnk-intl/,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured the Philippines on Saturday that the United States would come to its defense if attacked in the South China Sea, seeking to allay concerns about the extent of the US commitment to a mutual defense treaty. In meetings in Manila dominated by discussion on simmering US-China tensions over the Taiwan visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Blinken said a 70-year-old defense pact with the Philippines was “ironclad.” “An armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels and aircraft will invoke US mutual defense commitments under that treaty,” Blinken told a news conference. “The Philippines is an irreplaceable friend, partner, and ally to the United States.”  Blinken was the most senior US official to meet new President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr., the son of the late strongman who Washington helped to flee into exile in Hawaii during a 1986 “people power” uprising that ended his two-decade rule. In opening remarks to Blinken, Marcos sought to downplay the diplomatic flare-up over Taiwan and said he believed Pelosi’s trip “did not raise the intensity” of a situation that was already volatile. “We have been at that level for a good while, but we have sort of got used to the idea,” Marcos said. The Philippines is a fulcrum of the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China and Marcos faces a tricky challenge in balancing ties between the two major powers. He will also face domestic pressure to stand up to China in the South China Sea, without angering its leadership. US-Philippines ties were shaken by predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s overtures towards China, his famous anti-US rhetoric and threats to downgrade their military ties. On Saturday, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo said President Joe Biden had invited Marcos to Washington, and both sides were working on a suitable date. Marcos has not been to the US in more than a decade, due largely to a contempt of court order for his refusal to cooperate with a Hawaii court, which in 1995 ordered the Marcos family to return $2 billion of missing state wealth to victims of abuses by the state under his father’s rule. Marcos Jnr. and mother, Imelda, also face a $353 million fine. The US embassy in Manila has said heads of state have diplomatic immunity. Manalo said Washington was an important ally, but concerning nearby Taiwan he told Blinken the Philippines “looks at the big powers to help calm the waters.” “We can ill afford any further escalation of tensions,” he said.",Rodrigo Duterte;Ferdinand Marcos Jnr;Marcos Jnr;Marcos Jnr;Antony Blinken;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden;Enrique Manalo,United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,2474;MARITIME_INCIDENT,603;MARITIME_INCIDENT,856;MARITIME_INCIDENT,941;MARITIME,603;MARITIME,856;MARITIME,941;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,603;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,856;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,941;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,270;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,674;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,270;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,674;WB_1024_PUBLIC_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,270;WB_1024_PUBLIC_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,674;WB_1026_TREATIES,270;WB_1026_TREATIES,674;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,270;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,674;WB_137_WATER,2829;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVES,424;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,169;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1788;MILITARY_COOPERATION,2006;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,586;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,21;REBELLION,1194;EXILE,1151;CRISISLEX_C05_NEED_OF_SHELTERS,1140;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,2434;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,2434;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,546;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,893;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,978;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,432;LEADER,1042;LEADER,2095;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1042;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2095;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1042;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2095;AFFECT,2410;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1020;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,12;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2065;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,837;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,922;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,837;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,922;",Hawaii;Philippine;Taiwan;Philippines;Manila;United States;Chinese;Washington;South China Sea;China
507,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/middleeast/yemen-blockade-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here. Yemen’s warring parties have renewed a two-month-long truce, first signed in April this year. It was one of the first concrete steps taken towards peace in years and a genuine moment for celebration. But for thousands of families, time is running out.   While many in the international community celebrate, some families in Yemen are left watching their children slowly die.  There are around 30,000 people with life-threatening diseases requiring treatment abroad, according to the Houthi-controlled government in the capital Sanaa. Some 5,000 of them are children. The truce has allowed for flights transporting patients out of the country, but that mainly works for families who can afford treatment abroad. Thanks to the devastating effects of the war and the humanitarian crisis it created – once described by the UN as the world’s worst – most cannot.  For the last seven years, a Saudi-led coalition has tried to crush the Iran-backed Houthis, after the group – also known as Ansarullah – overthrew the internationally recognized government. The war led to a years-long fuel blockade imposed by the coalition and supported by the United States.   That support – and broader US backing for the military action in Yemen – is currently being challenged in a War Powers Resolution introduced by US Senator Bernie Sanders. The blockade, import restrictions and high inflation are all crippling Yemen’s health care systems and its economy.   Only 24 out of 36 fuel ships have been permitted by the coalition to enter the Red Sea port of Hodeida since the truce was established on April 2. It was a welcome injection of fuel – both for the economy and the operation of health care facilities – but still below what the UN says is sufficient “to support essential services.”  But beyond the statistics, here are some of the lives impacted by that reality.   Raneem Alkhalid is turning two in September. She was born with Down syndrome.   “She is an angel sent to us. I have four other children and she – my youngest – has my heart,” her father Abdelrahman says.  When Raneem started suffering from shortness of breath, none of Yemen’s health facilities were equipped to offer a diagnosis.  Luckier than most children in the country, Raneem’s family were able to send her with an aunt to Cairo in search of treatment. There she was diagnosed with weakness in the blood vessels of the heart and her aunt was told she required an operation to insert a stent to keep them open and pumping blood.   The surgery and the associated expenses came to $10,000 and a date was set for June 6. That’s where the family’s luck ran out. They didn’t have the money to pay and the date of the operation came and went.   “We have lost too many children in the last seven years of war,” Dr Abdulrahman Alhadi, who heads the Yemeni Children’s Leukaemia Center, told CNN. “They were waiting for a mercy, which never came.”   In his center alone, more than 300 children have died waiting to travel abroad for treatment. Dr Alhadi sent CNN a video of one of his patients, five-year-old Mohammed Salman. Both Mohammed and his six-year-old brother were told they needed a stem cell transplant for bone marrow failure caused by their hereditary aplastic anemia. His brother passed away five months ago, before the blockade was partially lifted. Now Mohammed waits alone.  “There is nothing harder for parents than to feel helpless when it comes to saving their children’s lives, Aisha Jumaan told CNN.  Jumaan’s US-based Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation is one of the few organizations trying to support families seeking treatment abroad. But the average cost of treatment for a child comes to $10,000. That would amount to roughly $50 million needed in total for children in need of life-saving treatment. It’s an uphill battle to save lives that can only be won with a coordinated and systemic response to Yemen’s crisis.  The bombs have stopped but preventable deaths in Yemen won’t end until the blockade is fully lifted and the war-fueled economic collapse is reversed. For now, the only thing that brings joy to Raneem and her family is music.   “When I start playing the children’s songs she loves she doesn’t even notice the pain,” her father says. “When she laughs and sings, it’s like everything around us is song. She’s an angel and I would give my life to keep her with us.”   To contribute to the effort to help Yemen’s children with life-threatening illnesses, you may donate to the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation at https://yemenfoundation.org/   The digest Iran nuclear talks resume in Vienna this week  Top Iranian, European and US officials were set to resume nuclear talks in Vienna on Friday, as Iran continues to enrich its uranium levels and accelerate its nuclear program.    OPEC agrees to produce slightly more oil as recession fears loom  The world’s oil-exporting countries have agreed to a tiny increase in output next month amid fears that a global recession will crimp demand.   Temperatures in Iraq top 50 degrees Celsius  Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, recorded a high temperature of 49.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday, which is equivalent to about 121 degrees Fahrenheit.    What to watch  US officials had expected the world’s oil-exporting countries to approve a much bigger increase in output in their August meeting.  In the same week, the US approved a possible multi-billion-dollar weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.   CNN’s Eleni Giokos speaks to the chief OPEC correspondent at Energy Intelligence, Amena Bakr, and editor-in-chief of Arab News, Faisal Abbas, about the significance of the two events.   Watch the report here:     Around the region What is already a big year for football in the Middle East just got even bigger as Saudi Arabia expressed interest in hosting the 2026 Women’s Asia Cup.   The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) announced on Monday that Saudi Arabia had registered its interest in hosting the tournament for the first time.   The Kingdom’s female football team played their first match in February this year against the Seychelles, which ended 2-0 to Saudi Arabia.    In response to the news, Saudi Arabia’s Women’s Football Federation tweeted “we aspire to host the continent of Asia for the biggest tournament for women in 2026.”  The AFC has said it will now begin working on getting in the bids from all interested countries and a decision will be made in 2023.  Women’s football has reached new global heights this year. The Women’s Euro 2022, hosted by England – the eventual victors – attracted record crowds. The total attendance across the tournament surpassed 570,000, more than double the record set in 2017, with 87,192 fans attending the final at Wembley, a new record for a women’s international game in Europe.

Andelman, a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award, is a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, author of “A Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen” and blogs at Andelman Unleashed.  He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres is hardly a global figure given to panic, or hyperbole for that matter. But rarely has he seemed quite so afraid.   “Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” Gutteres said this week. The way he and a growing number of those who think deeply about nuclear issues and their consequences see it, the world is plunging headlong towards potential Armageddon, with little regard to the consequences of their actions, or inaction. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seems to have paid little heed to such fears as she moved blithely ahead with her visit to Taiwan in the face of dire warnings from the leadership of mainland China, whose arsenal of 350 nuclear weapons  lies just across a narrow strait. And this in the context of bellicose words and actions from Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine and Kim Jong Un’s ongoing nuclear rhetoric and actions in nearby North Korea. Gutteres’s fears, of course, were broader and deeper than this single Asian flashpoint. He was addressing a world conference of the nations that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons – a gathering delayed by two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Signed on July 1, 1968, by 93 nations, and in force two years later, the treaty now has 191 adherents.  Yet never has it seemed more vulnerable, if not more relevant, than today.  The context, as Gutteres observed, was that this year’s conference – the 10th since its signing – “occurs at a time of nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War.”   Indeed, the very foundations of global security that have effectively guaranteed the peace since the explosion of the “Fat Man” plutonium device – the last ever detonated in battle over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 – have been deeply eroded.  The United States was, and remains, the only nation ever to have detonated a nuclear weapon in a war. The Soviet Union tested its first device four years later.  In July 1959, then-French President Charles de Gaulle sent the Count Alexandre de Marenches, the co-author of our book, “The Fourth World War”  to Washington, to ask US President Dwight Eisenhower to give France the secrets that would allow the French to join the nuclear club. Ike politely but firmly declined.  Still, in less than a year, France had exploded its first nuclear device, eight years after the British.  Russia was already en route to equalizing this balance. By the early 1960s, the Kremlin had deployed the first of what would be an arsenal of more than 3,000 nuclear weapons to Ukraine, where some of the first steps toward a Soviet bomb had been taken in Ukrainian institutes located in the now deeply contested cities of Kharkiv and Donetsk. More Soviet weapons then found their way to Belarus and Kazakhstan.  By the mid-1960s, on the western side of the Iron Curtain there were three nuclear powers (the US, Britain and France), on the eastern side, four ostensibily nuclear-armed states, though utterly controlled by the Kremlin. Effectively, there were just two nuclear blocs. There are many who look back on that era as the good old days of nuclear confrontation – and with good reason. Each side, for decades, possessed enough nuclear weapons – as many as 41,000 for the USSR and 31,000 for the US at their respective peaks – to have utterly obliterated the other side, not to mention all life on earth. This led to the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). Since then, arms control agreements have reduced the size of these arsenals dramatically – to levels still able to incinerate the earth, but without reducing  much of the tension. While arsenals have shrunk since the Cold War, the number of countries with nuclear weapons has proliferated.  How is it at all possible to have MAD when you have nuclear weapons in the hands of nine powers? (The countries in question are the US, Britain, France, Israel, Pakistan, India, Russia, China, and North Korea.) Within this group of nations, there are pockets of mutually assured destruction. Some 93% of all the world’s 13,900 nuclear weapons are still controlled by Washington and Moscow. To a degree, MAD prevails there, and indeed the prospect of mutually assured destruction comprises a good part of what has deterred Pakistan and India from launching their arsenals at each other during any of three Indo-Pakistani wars or other regular confrontations across their contested borders.  A broader threat, though, has only expanded. How likely is it that given some existential challenge, Russia or even China, which arrived in the nuclear club in 1964,  might not deploy a weapon of their own? Certainly, Russia has issued such a threat in Ukraine. Just weeks before its invasion of Ukraine, Russia conducted maneuvers with nuclear units, while Putin announced that his nuclear deterrent forces were being placed on a “special regime of alert.”  And then there are the peripheral nuclear powers. While most of the world has been preoccupied with Ukraine, Taiwan, and terrorist leaders in Afghanistan, North Korea has continued to launch missiles and threaten new rounds of nuclear tests. On Victory Day last month, Kim Jong Un warned he was “ready to mobilize” his nuclear deterrent.  Finally, we are potentially within weeks of a new round of escalations, this time involving Iran. Though Secretary of State Antony Blinken has embraced a return to the conference table to restore the nuclear accord that was restraining Iran’s headlong dash toward a nuclear weapon, there is little real evidence Iran is prepared to agree.   Indeed, on Monday the Biden administration unveiled a new round of sanctions targeting “illicit” support of the Iranian oil industry, which is already under crushing sanctions. And there are indications that the “breakout time” – the time needed for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon –  has shrunk to near-zero.  Should Iran test or even exhibit the capacity to test a nuclear weapon, its arch enemy Saudi Arabia has already indicated it will do all within its power to deploy its own. Indeed, it has fostered close relations with the nuclear programs of Pakistan and with China, whose appetite for foreign sources of oil knows few bounds.  It is hardly surprising that the UN Secretary-General has waxed so pessimistic. The speeches that followed his opening of the non-proliferation conference seemed scarcely calculated to return the genie to its nuclear bottle.  Blinken charged in his speech at the same conference that Russia is “engaged in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber-rattling” in Ukraine, while North Korea “is preparing to conduct its 7th nuclear test.” And as for Iran, it “remains on a path of nuclear escalation.”  “To escape the logic of fear,” Blinken concluded, should be the most immediate mission of all nations who’ve agreed to restrain the proliferation of nuclear arms. Somehow, though, an even more worthwhile objective might just be for the world to find a way to turn back the clock from 2022 to 1962 or even 1982. These were terrifying years when, innocently, we practiced weekly duck-and-cover exercises under our little wooden desks in kindergarten, dug home fallout shelters in our backyards against an imminent nuclear attack.

536,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/,"The FBI executed a search warrant Monday at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there, three people familiar with the situation told CNN. The former President confirmed that FBI agents were at Mar-a-Lago and said “they even broke into my safe.” He was at Trump Tower in New York when the search warrant was executed in Florida, a person familiar told CNN.  “My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said in a statement Monday evening.  The extraordinary move to search the home of a former president raises the stakes for the Justice Department and comes as Trump’s legal problems continue on multiple fronts. Trump is also expected in the coming months to announce he will launch another bid for the White House in 2024. The Justice Department has two known active investigations connected to the former President, one on the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, and the other involving the handling of classified documents. The search began early Monday morning and law enforcement personnel appeared to be focused on the area of the club where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are, according to a person familiar with the matter. The FBI’s search included examining where documents were kept, according to another person familiar with the investigation, and boxes of items were taken. Following the National Archives’ recovering of White House records from Mar-a-Lago in recent months, the FBI on Monday had to verify that nothing was left behind.  Trump’s son, Eric, told Fox host Sean Hannity that “the purpose of the raid, from what they said, was because the National Archives wanted to, you know, corroborate whether or not Donald Trump had any documents in his possession.” Christina Bobb, Trump’s attorney, said the FBI seized documents. “President Trump and his legal team have been cooperative with FBI and DOJ officials every step of the way. The FBI did conduct an unannounced raid and seized paper,” Bobb said There was communication between the FBI and US Secret Service before the search warrant was executed Monday, a person familiar with the matter said, allowing for the FBI to access the estate without any complications. There is only a small Secret Service footprint at Mar-a-Lago when Trump is not there.  CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment to CNN.  A White House official said it was not notified about the search. President Joe Biden, a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news. Investigation into documents The National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – including some that were classified. In early June, a handful of investigators made a rare visit to the property seeking more information about potentially classified material from Trump’s time in the White House that had been taken to Florida. The four investigators, including Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, sat down with two of Trump’s attorneys, Bobb and Evan Corcoran, according to a source present for the meeting.  At the beginning of the meeting, Trump stopped by and greeted the investigators near a dining room. After he left, without answering any questions, the investigators asked the attorneys if they could see where Trump was storing the documents. The attorneys took the investigators to the basement room where the boxes of materials were being stored, and the investigators looked around the room before eventually leaving, according to the source.  A second source said that Trump came in to say hi and made small talk but left while the attorneys spoke with investigators. The source said some of the documents shown to investigators had top secret markings.  Five days later, on June 8, Trump’s attorneys received a letter from investigators asking them to further secure the room where the documents were stored. Aides subsequently added a padlock to the room.  In April and May, aides to Trump at Mar-a-Lago were interviewed by the FBI as part of the probe into the handling of presidential records, according to a source familiar with the matter. “It is a federal crime to remove classified documents wrongly. And so if you are filling out that affidavit and you have to list the crime, you can list that as the crime,” said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and a CNN senior legal analyst. Honig told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that the timing of the search held with the longstanding department rule not to execute politically sensitive moves within 90 days of an election.  “Today is just about 90 days out exactly from the midterms, I think maybe 91 or 92 days out. That policy, that may be a reason why they did it today because they want to stay clear of that if they’re interpreting that as a 90 day rule,” he said. Members of GOP back Trump Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel claimed in a statement that Democrats “continually weaponize the bureaucracy against Republicans,” and a number of Republican lawmakers came to the former President’s defense on social media. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, wrote that he had “seen enough.” “Attorney General (Merrick) Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar. I’ve seen enough. The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” the Republican leader wrote. “When Republicans take back the House, we will  conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned.” GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said that “we need answers NOW. The FBI must explain what they were doing today & why.” But the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating Trump’s handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to “fully investigate” the former President’s handling of information. “Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,” Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said. “Although details of today’s actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.” This story has been updated with additional details.

18,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/health/relationship-compatibility-questions-wellness/,"You and your crush have been dating for a few months now, and you’ve agreed to take the next step by committing to a long-term relationship – then you hear something that catches you off guard.  They want to quit their job in a year and live off the grid, while you have planned on working in the city and staying close to your family. How did you miss this crucial information? And what now?  “When people first fall in love, where they first feel infatuation, sometimes logic goes out the window,” said Deborah Carr, a professor of sociology and director of the Center for Innovation in Social Science at Boston University. “There’s lots of data showing that logical thought patterns sometimes get lost in the fray when someone really is very attracted to a person or they’re feeling the throes of passion.” Depending how far into a relationship people are, not having assessed certain areas of compatibility early on can have difficult emotional and practical consequences, said Jeremy Nicholson, a Massachusetts-based social psychologist and contributor for Psychology Today.  If you discover you and your partner are incompatible, “you’re either in a relationship with somebody you love but makes you miserable because you can’t have a healthy relationship with them, or you break up with somebody that you’re deeply in love with,” Nicholson said. Even though having conversations about priorities early on seems difficult, in the long run, it’s actually much easier on your emotions, he added.   Additionally, as commitment increases, the practical aspects of partners’ lives often get more intertwined – “particularly financially,” Nicholson added. “So it becomes a bigger problem for you if you haven’t had these conversations and then they’re spending the rent money, and you both might be homeless.”  The dissolution of a relationship “also can be expensive, like when you have to divorce. Cohabitating and then finding a new apartment is very disruptive,” Carr said. Sometimes “it really can create difficulties for people and their family and friends when a serious relationship dissolves. So, I think it’s important to jump in cautiously and have as much information as possible.”   By the time you’re considering committing to a serious relationship with someone (or multiple someones), you probably already know their Covid-19 vaccination status, political affiliation or religious beliefs. Here are questions you should ask yourself and your love interests to assess red flags and overall compatibility each step of the way.  Committing long term When you’re considering commitment, ask yourself why you’re with this person, what benefits you’re gaining and what about them makes you happy, Carr said. “Sometimes the answer is, ‘Well I’m lonely, and I need someone.’ (But) that’s not really sufficient grounds for throwing oneself into a relationship,” she added.  “Couples I work with – who are new and just getting to know one another – don’t often attend as well as they should to their emotional compatibility, the degree to which they’re really comfortable with one another, or whether they’re just infatuated and attracted to one another,” said John Duffy, a psychologist specializing in work with teens, parents, couples and families.  Emotional compatibility is feeling like you can share anything with your partner, versus feeling guarded and as if you have to put on a facade, Duffy added.  “Willingness to commit is fairly easy,” Nicholson said, but does your partner want to commit to a short-term or long-term relationship? And what do they even mean by a long-term relationship? For some people, that looks like having a partnership, getting married or raising children. Is that relationship monogamous, open or polyamorous? Do you – and do they – like the idea of living together one day?  Compatibility In addition to knowing the type of relationship you want, it’s important to know how well you align from a practical standpoint on other values, finances and sexual activity.  Watch for value- or character-based red flags early on, such as a lack of financial generosity – evidenced by behaviors including not appropriately tipping waitstaff – excessive spending or extreme restriction. Paying attention to early signs of financial compatibility will pay off if you decide to cohabitate, Duffy said.  “It also shows up in other areas of relationships over time,” such as how generous they are with their time and attention, including when it comes to your physical needs and desires, he added.  Some people have lifestyles or medical conditions that might influence what they need from a partner. Does the person you’re planning to commit to have a substance misuse issue or sobriety journey for which they’ll need support? Or will you, and have you communicated that? How does your partner treat family members, people of different genders and people with whom they have strained relationships? Have they revealed signs of violent or aggressive behavior, such as road rage or snapping over an insignificant event? Do they argue using healthy and open communication, or does it feel cold and abusive?  “Part of the growth is disagreeing in a healthy way and learning and growing from that – growing together, even, from disagreements and finding your way back to making up with one another,” Duffy said. “That’s a really important issue to look at when you’re gauging the potential longevity of a relationship.”  Determining sexual compatibility includes asking what types of physical intimacy are and aren’t OK. “That can be everything from toys to oral sex to all kinds of foreplay … then we get into fetishes and fantasies and things like that,” Nicholson said. “If somebody needs a particular thing and the other person can’t stand it, then that’s kind of a red flag that either needs to be worked through or the relationship might not be able to progress.”  Regarding sex, the main questions are what types of activities both partners enjoy, and how often each person wants it, Nicholson said. People also differ in their beliefs about whether having one’s sexual needs met is solely their partner’s responsibility. Also, what’s your partner’s sleep routine like, if they have one at all?  “The bigger the disparity there, the more they’re going to have things to work out,” he said.  “It’s in people’s best interest to discuss sexually transmitted infections as soon as they become sexually active,” Carr added. Couples should discuss sexual health, including birth control and who will be responsible for it and any presumptions about that.  If your loved ones aren’t supportive of your partner, will you protect your relationship and set boundaries? What is your partner’s relationship like with their own family?  These days with dating apps, you might know something about a person’s life goals – such as whether they want children – early on. If not, for adults, between three and six months of being together is when having discussions about children is worthwhile, Duffy said.  Cohabitating Sharing a home with a partner can bring up additional considerations in each important area of compatibility.  When it comes to finances, assess a partner’s ability to be conscientious and follow through, Nicholson said. How do they plan to pay off high debts? Do they have a savings account?  Determine whether “they’re living an immediate, impulsive lifestyle, or whether they’re able to delay gratification, save and basically plan for the future,” Nicholson added. Also consider who’s going to pay for what and why, whether contributions depend on each person’s salary, and if you want to maintain separate or joint accounts. Expectations about household chores can become contentious if not discussed sooner rather than later. Sometimes people make assumptions based on their cultural background or beliefs about gender roles, Nicholson said. Partners should get a sense of each other’s existing beliefs, then discuss what they’re comfortable with moving forward. Carr said she typically recommends each person does what they enjoy.  Asking questions about long-term career goals is also critical, Carr added. If your partner foresees a major shift such as moving for a new job, are you expected to move with them? Which person gets to have the shorter commute and why?  Before saying ‘I do’  Many of the same compatibility assessments done for cohabitation also apply to marriage, but in the latter case, the expectations become more serious, Carr and Nicholson said.  You might be able to be somewhat flexible with someone’s spending habits while living together, but if they’re accruing debt and you’re going to marry them, their debts will become yours, too, Nicholson said. As your life becomes increasingly tied to theirs, you must be sure you’re comfortable with who they are and what they do, because you’ll be affected more than before.  Also, “it’s very difficult to change people,” Carr said. “As people age, they become an amplified version of their younger selves. So if there’s a trait in your partner that agitates you when you’re 25, that trait will get larger and might be far, far more annoying when one is 50 – so really ask yourself about the good, the bad and the ugly and what you’re willing to accept and not accept in a relationship.”  Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter.

294,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/health/public-health-monkeypox/,"The limited supply of monkeypox vaccines in the US has led to hours-long waits and lines that stretch for blocks, according to officials with state and local public health groups; some people with monkeypox symptoms have had to go without tests or treatments. And some have even crossed the border into Canada in search of help, the officials say. They, along with leaders of some national LGBTQ organizations, are frustrated and angry at the federal government for its “lack of urgency” about the ongoing outbreak.   They say they feel abandoned by the government and want monkeypox to be declared a public health emergency now.  “We are, once again, in a moment where a lack of urgency and an inadequate response has left our community filled with fear, unanswered questions and valid outrage. A moment where we have been abandoned by inaction,” Tyler TerMeer, CEO of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, said Tuesday.  The clinic managed by his foundation has a waiting list of 10,000 people who are eligible for the monkeypox vaccine. “This is unacceptable and completely preventible,” TerMeer said. “Our community of resilient people have had to once again rise up in support of one another, to educate each other and to fight for access to the resources that they need and deserve.” Monkeypox can infect anyone, but the majority of cases in the US outbreak have been among men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and people who identify as transgender. Since June, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it has made a concerted effort to do extensive education and outreach to the LGBTQ community. The agency says it has worked with the umbrella organization for local Pride committees to raise awareness. It released educational videos, engaged with groups that work with health disparities and industries whose workers may be exposed to monkeypox, and created awareness campaigns on Instagram and on dating apps popular with the gay community like Scruff, Adam4Adam and Grindr. The agency is also planning to participate in listening sessions with LGBTQ community groups.  But those efforts have not shortened the lines for vaccines or eliminated the extensive paperwork necessary to get access to treatments. In an effort to elevate their public health response, California, Illinois and New York state have declared public health emergencies, as has the World Health Organization. San Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency last week, and New York City did so Saturday. The federal government is monitoring the response to monkeypox across the country and will use that to consider whether to declare its own public health emergency, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said last week. “We’ve made vaccines, tests and treatments well beyond the numbers that are currently needed, available to all jurisdictions who manage their public health systems,” he said. “We will weigh any decision on declaring a public health emergency based on the responses we’re seeing throughout the country. Bottom line is, we need to stay ahead of it and be able to end this outbreak.”  Torrian Baskerville, director of HIV and health equity at the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, said community members shouldn’t have had to create their own online tracking systems to figure out when and where vaccines and treatments are available because of a lack of information from local government agencies.  “Our system is not set up to respond to these emergencies effectively, especially when it affects vulnerable and often marginalized populations,” Baskerville said. He has spoken with several members of the community who have not gotten the help they need to treat or prevent the sometimes extremely painful disease.   One man who had clear signs of monkeypox told Baskerville that he was turned away from his local health department, denied testing and treatment because there were no more appointments, even though he arrived during clinic hours.  Another man told Baskerville that he is facing eviction. Unable to work, in isolation with monkeypox symptoms for more than 25 days, he said he’d been denied medical leave three times and must spend at least five more days in isolation because he still has symptoms.  Another told him they had to lie about how many recent sex partners they’ve had because some state and local health departments have had to ration vaccines, giving them only to people who have had three or more partners in the past two weeks.   “The frustrations and concerns of gay and bisexual men and transgender men and women who are, at this moment, most impacted by [monkeypox] are very real and clear,” Bakersville said.  Several public health experts have said the US missed its opportunity to contain the monkeypox virus because it has been too slow to act. Access to vaccines has been a struggle since the outbreak reached the US two months ago. The CDC estimates that about 1.5 million people are eligible for the vaccine, but as of Thursday, the US Department of Health and Human Services said, more than 340,000 doses have been delivered. As of Monday evening, the US has tallied at least 5,811 confirmed or probable monkeypox cases, a number that experts say is still a significant undercount.  With limited supply and growing awareness of the virus and its sometimes-painful effects, vaccination appointments are going fast.   David C. Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said Tuesday that the organization invited public health clinic directors from across the country to a meeting with the Biden administration Monday where they talked about how this part of the monkeypox outbreak feels too familiar. Managing monkeypox is similar to the earliest days of HIV and Covid-19, he said. “Program after program talked about the fear and stigma that gay men are experiencing in relation to [monkeypox], the shortages of vaccine, the burned-out staff, the shortages of funding to cover what has been an unanticipated public health emergency,” he said. Harvey said that his association was pleased that the White House named two monkeypox response leaders Tuesday, but the community needs the federal government to declare a state of emergency to bring in more money and staff.    He labeled the outbreak “out-of-control” and added that it’s something many public health leaders warned would happen if the federal government didn’t act with urgency.  Congress must also act quickly to approve the $21 billion Pandemic Preparedness Act, he said, because local health officials need more money and the country needs to reduce and eliminate barriers to testing, care, vaccines and grants.  Harvey was specifically critical of Becerra, who said at a news conference last week that “everybody’s got to take the oar and row. Everybody’s got to do their part” and that local jurisdictions need to “work with” HHS on data reporting about how they are using vaccines.  Becerra said communities need to work to prevent the spread of monkeypox and hand out vaccines. Without that work, more vaccines will be necessary. “But if everyone does their work,” he said, “can we not only stay ahead of the virus, but end this outbreak? Absolutely.”  Harvey thinks local health leaders have been going above and beyond to do what they can with the resources they have.  “States and localities really have been left to respond to many aspects of this outbreak on their own. This is contrary to the comments made by Secretary Becerra last week, when he seemed to appear to blame the states and the cities for not responding adequately,” he said. “Mr. Secretary, we are failing Americans today. And this is a public health failure that follows Covid and the various earliest days of HIV in this country. It is time for us to turn this situation around.”",Tyler Termeer;Xavier Becerra;Torrian Baskerville,Instagram;White House;Human Services;Human Services;World Health Organization;Us Centers For

The US Coast Guard tweeted photos and a video that show the boat full of people, many in orange life vests. Some had jumped from the boat and were rescued from the water.

634,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/trevor-reed-brittney-griner-sentence-russia-cnntv/,"Trevor Reed, a US citizen freed earlier this year after being detained in Russia for nearly three years, said Friday that Brittney Griner’s sentence by a Russian court is “clearly political.” Griner, a WNBA star who was arrested in Russia in February, was convicted Thursday of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time. She plays there in the off-season and was accused of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. “Regardless of how you feel about Brittney Griner’s case, that sentence is clearly political. There’s no denying that,” Reed told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.”  Reed, a former US Marine, was arrested in Russia in 2019, accused of endangering the “life and health” of Russian police officers in an altercation – charges that he and his family denied. He was sentenced by a Russian court to nine years in prison in 2020 and had been transferred to a labor camp during his detainment. Reed was released in a prisoner swap in April and returned home to the US. Reed on Friday laid out what could happen next for Griner, who has returned to the Russian detention center where she was kept during her trial while her lawyers vow to appeal the sentence. “Once you are convicted in Russian court, you do have a chance to go to appeals, and appeal that decision to another kangaroo court in Moscow. So after that trial, you know, depending on Brittney’s decision on whether she wants to appeal or not, she may stay in Moscow at the detention facility that she is already at until her appeals are completed. Or if she chooses not to go to appeals, they may transfer her to a forced labor camp. Considering the fact that the Russian government is considering exchanging her, they may also decide to leave her in Moscow to make it easier for her to be returned to the United States,” Reed said. Reed said anyone who’s held in a Russian forced labor camp is “facing serious threats to their health” due to malnutrition, little to no medical attention and the risk of contracting diseases. The Biden administration has classified Griner as wrongfully detained and continues to negotiate for her release. Reed had previously told CNN that he believes Griner and Paul Whelan, another wrongfully detained American in Russia, “have a really good chance” of being released following CNN’s exclusive reporting that the Biden administration offered to exchange convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout as part of a potential deal to secure Griner and Whelan’s release. Russian government officials requested last month that a former colonel from the country’s domestic spy agency, who was convicted of murder in Germany last year, be included in the US’ proposed swap of Bout for Griner and Whelan, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told reporters in Cambodia on Friday that the Kremlin is “ready to discuss this topic, but within the framework of the channel that has been agreed by the presidents,” state news agency RIA Novosti reported. And shortly after, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the same summit that the US will “pursue” talks with Russia. Reed told CNN Friday: “I am hoping that there will be an exchange that we are able to get them home, so I am hoping for the best in that.”",Viktor Bout;Antony Blinken;Paul Whelan;Brittney Griner;Brittney Griner;Sergey Lavrov;Trevor Reed,Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_SPY,2621;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASES,2045;WB_1406_DISEASES,2045;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2045;POLITICAL_PRISONER,893;POLITICAL_PRISONER,1647;POLITICAL_PRISONER,1915;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZEN,31;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2268;SOC_GENERALCRIME,218;SOC_GENERALCRIME,658;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,3094;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,2830;SMUGGLING,291;FOOD_SECURITY,1977;TAX_DISEASE_MALNUTRITION,1977;UNGP_AFFORDABLE_NUTRITIOUS_FOOD,1977;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,297;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,297;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,297;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,297;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,297;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,297;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,297;TRIAL,324;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,743;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,1154;SECURITY_SERVICES,734;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,734;LEADER,3012;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENTS,3012;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1697;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2538;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1697;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2538;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,334;MEDIA_MSM,2863;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,178;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,550;HUMAN_TRAFFICKING,1642;HUMAN_TRAFFICKING,1910;WB_1668_LABOR_STANDARDS,1642;WB_1668_LABOR_STANDARDS,1910;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,1642;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,1910;WB_1669_FORCED_LABOR,1642;WB_1669_FORCED_LABOR,1910;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,1642;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,1910;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2000;ENV_OIL,441;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,86;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,228;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,309;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,668;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1345;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1480;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1781;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2278;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2813;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,3175;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_KANGAROO,1321;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,2830;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,849;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,849;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,849;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,849;GENERAL_HEALTH,716;GENERAL_HEALTH,1957;MEDICAL,716;MEDICAL,1957;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1093;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1497;WB_840_JUSTICE,1093;WB_840_JUSTICE,1497;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1093;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1497;CRIME_ILLEGAL_DRUGS,437;ARREST,76;ARREST,2118;ARREST,2259;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,76;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2118;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2259;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,151;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,727;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,828;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1083;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1230;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1686;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1897;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,2426;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,2527;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,151;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,727;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,828;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1083;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1230;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1686;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1897;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,2426;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,2527;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2548;TAX_FNCACT_COLONEL,2591;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,3085;",Russian;Kremlin;Germany;United States;Russia;Moscow;American
610,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/asia/south-korea-danuri-space-launch-lunar-orbiter-intl-hnk-scn/,"South Korea launched its first moon mission on Thursday as its homegrown lunar orbiter took off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station aboard a SpaceX rocket. A live broadcast of the launch on Friday morning in South Korea showed the orbiter “Danuri” – which means “enjoy the moon” – successfully separating from the Falcon 9 rocket. Developed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), the 678-kilogram (about 1,500 pounds) craft has six payloads, including Korean-made equipment. It is expected to enter the moon’s orbit in December before starting a yearlong observation mission where it will search for possible landing sites for future missions, conduct scientific research of the lunar environment and test space internet technology, South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT said in a statement.  If it succeeds, South Korea will become the world’s seventh lunar explorer, and the fourth in Asia, behind China, Japan and India.  Friday’s launch comes as South Korea accelerates its burgeoning space program and seeks to send a probe to the moon by 2030.  In June, the country successfully launched satellites into orbit with its homegrown Nuri rocket in a significant step for its space program. Space launches have long been a sensitive issue on the Korean peninsula, where North Korea faces international sanctions over its nuclear-armed ballistic missile program. In March, North Korea called for expanding its space rocket launch site to advance its space ambitions, after South Korea and the United States accused it of testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile under the guise of launching a space vehicle.  South Korea says its space program is for peaceful and scientific purposes and any military use of the technology, such as in spy satellites, is for its defense.

61,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/business-food/candy-tasting-job-posting/,"A Canadian candy company is offering a very sweet gig.  Candy Funhouse, an online retailer of confectionery treats from chocolate bars to gummies and licorice, is hiring for a $78,000 a year ($100,000 Canadian), work-from-home job as its Chief Candy Officer.  Duties include: “leading candy board meetings, being the head taste tester … and all things fun.”   Several thousand candidates have already applied for the position, which was posted on LInkedIn in July, said Chief Executive Officer Jamal Hejazi. He noted that he’s been surprised by the number of “golden ticket” themed applications and the elaborate videos of entire families offering to share the tasting duties and salary.  But Hejazi also sees the attraction. “Imagine your best memories around candy, and having that every day at work,” he said. Candy Funhouse, based outside of Toronto, is headed by a quartet of 20- and 30-something siblings who grew up in the area and whose parents owned donut shops and a local restaurant.  “My brother Mo, a candyhead, founded it in 2018 and my mother was employee no. 2,” said Hejazi, adding that he and a younger sister and brother later joined the firm.  The family hoped to differentiate their company from other highly successful online and brick-and-mortar competitors such as Mars, Hershey and Amazon with a “weird” mix of products, no minimum orders — “we’ll sell one lollipop” — and a strong push on social media. Sales in 2021, boosted substantially by the pandemic, were “just under $15 million. I’m not kidding,” Hejazi said.  The family retains a 90% ownership stake. The company said the Chief Candy Officer position is open to applicants as young as five years old — although parental permission would likely be required. Many parents have filmed their child filling out the application and posted it online.  The company has 340,000 followers on Instagram and three million on Tik-Tok, including a Kardashian, Hejazi said, although he declined to specify which one. Right now, the company is prepping for Halloween, its biggest sales period last year. “We have 40% of our stock in” so far, Hejazi said. Last week, candy giant Hersheys reported that it will have difficulty meeting Halloween-related demand this year.   Hejazi also noted that reports on social media claiming that the Chief Candy Officer will be required to eat 3,500 pieces of candy per month are incorrect. (That number represents the different varieties the company stocks.) “That would be 117 a day,” Hejazi said. “That’s too many.”",Jamal Hejazi,Instagram,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,405;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,265;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,495;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,1762;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,2453;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_OFFICER,513;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,505;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1925;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1578;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2429;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1578;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2429;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1578;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2429;MEDIA_SOCIAL,474;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE_OFFICER,513;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE,505;TAX_FNCACT_RETAILER,114;GENERAL_HEALTH,1632;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1632;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1632;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1632;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1632;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1632;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1632;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1632;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEE,1094;TAX_ETHNICITY_CANADIAN,32;TAX_ETHNICITY_CANADIAN,233;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,279;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,513;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1776;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2467;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,279;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,513;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1776;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2467;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,1578;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2429;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,1578;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2429;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,1578;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2429;",Toronto;Canadian;New York
511,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-killings-sunday/,"A 27-year-old Muslim man killed last week in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is being remembered as a “brilliant public servant” committed to “improving conditions and inclusivity for disadvantaged minorities,” according to the mayor of the city he worked for. Police believe the death of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain on August 1 could be linked to the killings of three other Muslim men. The most recent killing, which Albuquerque police were alerted to Friday night, came a day after authorities determined there was a connection between the killings of Hussain and 41-year-old Aftab Hussein, who, like Hussain was from Pakistan. Detectives are working to determine whether the November killing of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan killed outside a business he ran with his brother, was also related.  Authorities are now looking for a “vehicle of interest” they say is potentially connected to the murders, Albuquerque Police Department Deputy Chief Cecily Parker said Sunday. The car is described as a dark silver, sedan-style Volkswagen Jetta or Passat with tinted windows, Parker said.  At the time he was killed, Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española, New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor, who said he was “deeply saddened” to learn of the man’s death.  “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.”  Hussain, who had worked for the office for a year, studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan, the mayor’s release said, before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico.  “Our City staff has lost a member of our family,” the mayor’s statement said, “and we all have lost a brilliant public servant who wanted to serve and improve his community.” The University of New Mexico community is similarly “heartbroken” over Hussain’s death, President Garnett S. Stokes said in a statement, calling Hussain “an inspiring leader and a really special Lobo who touched so many lives.”  “It was my privilege to know and work with him,” Stokes said.  Jesse Alemán, the acting dean of graduate studies at the university, called Hussain a “brilliant, respected student leader” who “continued to extend his compassionate leadership skills and educational expertise at the local and state levels” after he graduated. Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, who said Hussain worked on her campaign for Congress, said his “smile and his passion lit up a room.”  “His work as a field organizer for our campaign inspired countless people with his compassion and dedication to working in partnership with our communities, as one of the kindest and hardest working people I have ever known,” Stansbury said at the news conference Sunday.  Victims were ‘ambushed with no warning,’ police say The attacks have drawn condemnation from political leaders, including President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.  “While we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims’ families, and my Administration stands strongly with the Muslim community,” Biden wrote on Twitter.  Vice President Kamala Harris and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham similarly expressed support for New Mexico’s Muslim community, with the latter describing the attacks as “deeply angering and wholly intolerable.”  “I am incredibly angry about the situation,” the governor said Sunday. “Every New Mexican should stand up and be against this kind of hatred. It has no place in this city and it has no place in our state,” Lujan Grisham said.  Speaking to the Muslim community in Albuquerque and across the state Sunday, Congresswoman Stansbury said Muslims are “part and parcel of who we are in New Mexico.” “I want to say that every one of us in New Mexico must rise to meet these acts of hatred by demonstrating love, by demonstrating friendship and by demonstrating solidarity. This is not New Mexico. This is not who we are,” Stansbury said. “We will stand in solidarity. We will stand in grief and in mourning. And we will stand in our commitment to love and inclusion and belonging in this community.” The FBI is assisting with the investigation, according to a news release from the Albuquerque Police Department, which has created an online portal where residents can upload videos and images that may help authorities investigating the recent killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has voted to increase a reward for information that helps lead to an arrest from $15,000 to $20,000.  “These shootings are disturbing,” Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said in a news conference Saturday, soon after the fourth victim was discovered.  Albuquerque police officers responded just before midnight Friday to reports of a shooting in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue, and found the victim dead, according to the police department’s news release. The victim, a Muslim man believed to be in his mid-20s, was from South Asia, police said. His identity has not been positively confirmed, the release added. Hussain, Hussein and Ahmadi, were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the police department’s Criminal Investigations Division, previously said. “Our top priority is keeping the community safe and we are asking the Muslim community especially, to be vigilant, to watch out for one another. If you see something, say something,” the police chief said Saturday. “Evil will not prevail.” The Muslim community is living in fear due to the killings, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Sunday, and the city is taking steps to increase security. “We have heard from the community that the fear is so strong, there is a concern about even things like groceries and getting meals for certain folks in certain areas of town,” Keller said. The city is providing meals for those affected by the shootings, he added.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations is also offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible, the organization announced, calling the series of killings a “horrific, hateful shooting spree.”  “We thank local, state and federal law enforcement for their ongoing work on this crisis, and we call the Biden administration to ensure that authorities all of the resources needed to both protect the Albuquerque Muslim community and stop those responsible for these horrific crimes before they claim more innocent lives,” CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said in a statement.

398,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/business/lucid-production-target-cut/,"Shares of luxury electric car maker Lucid plunged more than 10% Thursday after the company disclosed it will make roughly half the cars this year it had planned to build. The company said it is dealing with the serious supply chain problems that have disrupted other automakers’ production as well. But its supply chain issues caused it to totally shut production at times during the quarter, as well as scale back its production target to 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles this year, down from its previously stated goal of 12,000 to 14,000 vehicle. The company said it was able to ship 1,400 cars during the first half of this year. It said that during the just completed quarter it held back shipments of a “significant number” of cars “to ensure that these cars met the highest standard of quality.” “Quality must take a priority over volume as a luxury brand,” said Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson in a call with investors Wednesday afternoon. While other automakers have indeed temporarily shut down production lines due to chip shortages, they have often kept factories humming by removing certain features like heated seats. Overall Lucid reported an adjusted net loss of $555.3 million, which was better than the forecast of a loss of $619 million from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, and better than its $604.6 million loss in the first quarter. Revenue was $97.3 million. It said that the number of orders it has for its cars has risen to 37,000, from the 30,000 backlog in orders at the end of last year. Lucid’s cars have gotten some top awards, with the Lucid Air winning the MotorTrend Car of the Year award last year. The Dream edition of that car can go an industry-best 520 miles on a single charge. But Lucid\n            \n                (LCDX) shares had already declined 46% so far this year through Wednesday’s close, with Thursday’s drop only adding to the decline.",Peter Rawlinson,,"SHORTAGE,1048;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,1284;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,888;",New York

181,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/weather/kentucky-flooding-deaths-wednesday/,"Gabriel Hensley, a father of five who stopped to help an injured driver and was later swept away by floodwaters himself was found dead this week, as the storm damage across eastern Kentucky complicates efforts to find the many people still unaccounted for. “He was a hero,” his wife, Macy, told CNN. “He was the one that was out helping people instead of worrying about himself.” Hensley, 30, is among at least 38 people whose deaths were connected to the late July floods. Heavily damaged infrastructure has made some communities nearly impossible to access, and accounting for everyone will likely be a weekslong process, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Many who survived the floods are finding themselves in destroyed communities. Scores of people have lost their homes. Some remain stranded because of washed-out roads, without access to clean water or electricity, unable to reach loved ones because of lost cell service and unable to receive critical supplies, including medication. And as those communities struggle to recover, they face another weather threat this week: scorching heat. A heat advisory was issued for eastern Kentucky – including the areas hit hardest by the floods – from noon Wednesday to Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. Beshear announced eight cooling centers will be open across the region, warning residents weather conditions will be “really hot and really dangerous.”  ‘He just wanted to get home’  As some communities begin picking up the pieces, others are grieving the loss of family and friends. Hensley, the father of five, had just finished his shift at coal mines in Perry County early Thursday morning when he began making his way home. But the rising waters quickly made his usual return route impassable, his wife said.  He instead took an alternative route, which led him to the scene of an accident. The driver of a four-wheeler was injured after floodwaters spun him off his vehicle, Hensley told his wife on the phone. “All (Hensley) could say is ‘he’s bleeding, he’s bleeding,’” Macy said.  Without second thought, Hensley drove to his brother-in-law’s house, which was nearby, to ask for help for the wounded driver. But when the two went back, they couldn’t find him despite a lengthy search, Chase Williams, Hensley’s brother-in-law said. They decided to help get Hensley home safely, Williams said. Hensley would drive them as far down the road – and as close to home – as possible, and then, Hensley would walk to the other side of some hills, where a friend was waiting to take him home to his family. The brother-in-law would take Hensley’s truck back to his home for safekeeping. “We got down the road a little bit but in a matter of minutes the water rose up enough where it picked up the truck and took us both into the creek,” Williams said. Williams escaped through the passenger door, using a tree to lift himself and make it up to the creek’s bank, where he was able to use his phone’s flashlight to begin signaling for help. Neighbors who saw the flash responded and the group began searching for Hensley. “We looked for Gabe for a very long time that night but we could never find him,” Williams said. Hensley’s body was discovered Sunday. The children he leaves behind include a 10-week-old son. “He was a family man,” his wife said. “No matter the storm. No matter how bad it got. He just wanted to get home to his home and family.” Lives altered ‘at the blink of an eye’ Beshear has called the disaster “one of the most devastating deadly floods that we have seen in our history.” “This hit such a huge area impacting thousands of people,” the governor told CNN Tuesday.” The way this water came in … it swept some people miles away from where they were taken, and it’s going to be a process that will take weeks to account for everybody.” It’s going to take even longer to rebuild the flooded communities, the governor has said. “Pictures belongings, memorabilia, things that kids made when they were growing up, and at the blink of an eye that’s all gone,” Nee Jackson, the Emergency Management Director for Pike County, told CNN. “I was at a house the other evening. Folks had taken quite a few things out, … they were trying to dry pictures and things from their marriage, really sad things that you can’t replace.” Roughly 30 to 40 bridges were washed out or are inaccessible in the county, Jackson said.  In neighboring Letcher County, in the city of Fleming-Neon, residents are concerned over access to clean, running water. The City Hall was destroyed, with more than a foot of mud still covering its insides Tuesday. The town bank, pharmacy and post office were all flooded, which means locals – many of whom are older and still get paychecks and retirement checks through the mail – are now struggling to access their money and medication, Mayor Susan Polis told CNN. The floods also destroyed the sole grocery store in the small community of Isom, one of the store’s owners told CNN. Gwen Christon, 67, who owns the IGA grocery store with her husband, said the waters completely contaminated and ruined everything.  “Our produce case, dairy case and frozen food cases were thrown all over the store. Our shelving that holds our grocery products had fallen and groceries were everywhere,” Christon said. “Machines were floating.” She told CNN they lost about $250,000 in inventory, but are determined to reopen. “I do want to reopen because the next grocery store is 12 miles away and the other one is 25 miles away,” Christon said. “People depend on this store.” In Clay County, Judge/Executive John Johnson said there are between 100 and 125 miles of damage reported, and officials are working to rebuild roads. Beshear on Wednesday issued an emergency order to make it easier for flood victims in 13 eastern Kentucky counties to replace lost driver’s licenses and other important documents at no cost, the governor’s office announced.  Some schools in eastern Kentucky were also destroyed while others with damage are expected to delay the start of their school year, Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Toni Tatman told CNN. Tatman expects local schools boards in roughly 11 affected public school districts will modify start days for the upcoming academic year. Many of the impacted schools were scheduled to welcome students back next week. Now, start dates will likely vary depending on individual districts and schools. As soon “as the immediate needs of food, shelter, and clothing are identified and met and power and water services are restored, districts are beginning to plan their return to school,” Tatman said. Fundraising to help those impacted by the flooding have been underway, including one hosted by the University of Kentucky’s men’s basketball team. The team held a three-hour open practice at its arena in Lexington in conjunction with a telethon for flood relief hosted by the Red Cross and WLEX. Donations were accepted at the door, by phone and online, and by the end of the session more than $2 million had been raised, the school said.

470,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/us-climate-bill-reputation-cop27/,"The Democrats’ $369 billion climate package, the largest such investment in US history, could have significant implications for global greenhouse gas emissions and the US’ standing in the world, after months of uncertainty in Congress undermined the Biden administration’s claims that “America is back.”  US officials are hoping it puts them in a better position for difficult negotiations to come: the international climate talks in Egypt this fall.   The inability of US lawmakers to pass federal climate legislation has for years been a black eye for the country’s international delegates at global climate talks. The Trump years were a low point, but even at COP26 in Glasgow last year, President Joe Biden and US Climate Envoy John Kerry’s calls to action did not have the necessary legislative weight behind them.  Kerry and Biden now have billions of legislative investments in clean energy to tout when they go to COP27 in November, which US lawmakers and experts say is a gamechanger.  “I think we all felt like we were walking through the desert with no hope of finding water, and the vultures were starting to circle,” Heather Zichal, CEO of trade group American Clean Power and a former Obama White House climate official, told CNN. “We’re now talking about over $360 billion [of climate investment]. It’s really apples and oranges in terms of what you can get.”   But while the bill is being welcomed overseas, there’s an overarching feeling that the US is simply catching up to its allies after years of inaction. Pressure has also increased for the US to take financial responsibility for its historic role in the crisis.  “It’s obviously a good thing but it’s important not to get carried away,” Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the London-based Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, told CNN of the bill.  Ward said the bill gave the pledges the US had already made a “degree of credibility,” but what much of the world wants to see the US commit to significant climate finance – funds to help the most vulnerable countries reduce emissions and adapt to the crisis.    “The issues that are still key in the discussions are not really addressed by this bill – there’s nothing in the bill on international climate finance, which is a bit worrying,” Ward said. “Leadership is now required from the rich countries in climate finance.”  Climate finance wouldn’t typically be included in the kind of tax and climate bill Democrats are preparing to pass, and Biden has asked for climate finance in his 2023 budget. But the US has a history of pushing back against international calls for financial tools. At last year’s talks, the US was against a loss-and-damage scheme that would compensate impacted countries for the harm the climate crisis has done.  Still, if the bill is passed, lawmakers and experts said it would represent a serious boost in Biden’s ability to make good on his international climate commitments. It would put the US on a path to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 31-44% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade, according to nonpartisan climate think tank Rhodium Group. Biden has pledged to cut US emissions in half by 2030.  “All of a sudden, we can show up at these conferences with not just rhetorical leadership but policy leadership,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told CNN. “It makes it a lot harder for laggard countries to claim that the US is talking out of both sides of its mouth – and use that as an excuse to sit on the sidelines.”  China-US tensions could overshadow progress While the bill allocates a historic amount of money to climate and clean energy, it’s also trying to achieve something bigger – competitiveness with China in renewables and manufacturing jobs at home, too.  The bill contains $60 billion towards domestic clean energy manufacturing and $30 billion for a production credit tax credit for wind, solar and battery storage. Its electric vehicles tax credit is written to incentivize US manufacturing, or manufacturing in countries with which the US has a free trade agreement, like Canada and Mexico.   But China has cornered the market on manufacturing solar panels and EV batteries, and American lawmakers and experts have long warned that the US will fall behind if Congress doesn’t invest in a domestic supply chain with funding and tax credits.  Murphy and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado told CNN they hoped the bill would encourage a productive rivalry with China – pushing the world’s largest emitter (the US is now the second largest) to do more to decarbonize.  “China is our rival. They’re going to be paying very close attention to this and I guarantee you’re they’re going to come out and show they’re going to do even more and better than we can,” Hickenlooper said. “If you look at how much solar and wind China’s been implementing in the last few years, it’s been dramatic. Now they’re going to have to ramp it up even more because we’re going after it.”   The US-China rivalry had for decades stymied climate negotiations before the 2015 Paris Agreement. But a climate partnership between the two nations announced last year in Glasgow gave hope that the world’s two biggest polluters might just cooperate enough to put a real dent in emissions.   But that is now on hold. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would suspend bilateral climate change talks, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan. The two nations had been cooperating on climate even when tensions escalated in other arenas in recent years.   Sam Geall, CEO of the think tank China Dialogue, told CNN that he doesn’t believe the US legislation would have had much of an impact on China’s climate decisions.  “China has its own concerns, like the fallout of the Russian invasion, macroeconomics, Covid lockdowns, and its critical National Congress conference in the autumn,” Geall said. “Even if there were such a positive shift, I’m not sure it’d be that impactful on the COP, given the other issues distracting attention and stoking tensions at the moment.”  Ward cautioned the US to stay humble in the lead up to the November summit and remember how the whiplash of the Trump administration reoriented international politics on climate.  “The US is kind of just playing catch-up, and I do worry sometimes the United States has forgotten that the world did not stand still for those years of the Trump administration, when it got on with things,” Ward said. “To some extent, there’s been a change in the world order, and the US cannot dominate in the same way as it did before.” ",Xie Zhenhua;Xie Zhenhua;John Kerry;John Kerry;John Kerry;Bob Ward;Heather Zichal;John Hickenlooper;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden;Sam Geall;Fabrice Coffrini;Chris

434,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/albuquerque-muslim-murders/,"Albuquerque police and the FBI are investigating three recent murders of Muslim men for “possible ties to the same offender,” according to Albuquerque police. Two members of the same mosque, Muhammed Afzaal Hussain, 27, and Aftab Hussein, 41, both from Pakistan, were murdered in southeast Albuquerque in the past week, police said in a news release. Detectives are now trying to determine whether any connections exist between those killings and the November 2021 murder of another Muslim man, Mohammad Ahmadi, who was of South Asian descent. “While we are still sifting through all the evidence to look for more connections, it is deeply troubling that these three men were Muslim and of similar descent,” said Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the police department’s Criminal Investigations Division. Hartsock asked for the public’s help in identifying “the shooter or shooters,” saying the victims in all three cases were “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed.” Investigators met with leaders of the Islamic Center of New Mexico on Thursday morning. “I want to reassure our friends in the Muslim community that we are making these crimes a top priority for the department,” APD Chief Harold Medina said. CNN has reached out to the Islamic Center of New Mexico for comment. FBI Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda also pledged the FBI’s help in locating the “person or persons” responsible.  “We offer our condolences to the relatives of the victims and we will not rest until justice is done,” he said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Friday announced a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the deaths of the three men, according to a release from CAIR.  “If a bias-motive is determined, state and federal authorities should apply appropriate hate crime charges,” CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said.

404,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/opinions/biden-wins-approval-rating-ghitis/,"Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. For a president who so many people believe is failing, Joe Biden sure is suddenly notching up an impressive string of victories. And they’re not minor. In fact, Biden is on a roll when it comes to both domestic and foreign policy.  After a number of painful defeats, including high-profile setbacks on his Build Back Better bill, the Biden presidency seems to have turned the tide. On Thursday, Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona announced she would support the Inflation Reduction Act, all but assuring the landmark climate, health care and tax proposal will pass in the 50-50 Senate. Hours later, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released data that shows the nation’s economy is still powering ahead, regaining more than half a million jobs in July. Unemployment is now down to just 3.5%, matching the half-century low last seen in February 2020.  And yet, there’s little sign that the President’s standing has enjoyed a meaningful lift. Biden is winning battles, but he’s not getting a lot of love. Is it only a matter of time before Biden’s polls catch up with the new wave of accomplishments?   It’s difficult to redraw an image after it has been etched in the public mind. The right’s efforts to paint the 79-year-old as senile and unable to meet the demands of his office have been largely successful, certainly among Republicans. And many Democrats, particularly young people, have been turning away from the President, disappointed with the pace and scope of what his administration has been able to achieve.  Now, after months of legislative gridlock, however, Biden’s agenda is not just inching along – it is galloping ahead. On foreign policy, Biden had a fine week, despite simmering tensions with China. US forces killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, who took over al Qaeda after Osama bin Landen’s killing. Biden was deeply involved in the decision to launch the precision drone strike that led to his death in Kabul, making sure to avoid the civilian deaths that have tainted other counterterrorism operations.  But the more historic moment came on Wednesday, when the Senate overwhelmingly voted to approve a resolution to ratify membership for Finland and Sweden in NATO – only Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voted against it while GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted present. It was arguably the most consequential expansion of the alliance in decades, and a huge blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin. More than five months after he launched his war, Putin’s efforts to control Ukraine and divide NATO have failed in large part because Biden has held the alliance together, even helping Europe face Putin’s weaponization of gas exports. But it was on the domestic front that Biden once seemed to struggle the most. After promising bipartisanship as a candidate, Biden couldn’t even get all 50 Democrats in the Senate to support key pieces of his agenda. Now, despite the GOP’s alarming radicalization and numerous setbacks caused by Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Sinema (not to mention the Supreme Court), Congress is passing multiple pieces of important legislation. Last week, Congress approved the CHIPS Act by a wide margin, which will increase semiconductor production and make the US more competitive against China.  That came shortly after Biden signed the first major gun safety law in decades. Despite falling short of what Biden and his party advocated for, its passage in the current political environment is a remarkable achievement.  Speaking of bipartisanship, 47 Republicans joined House Democrats to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. The bill, a preventive measure following Justice Clarence Thomas’ call to reconsider the Supreme Court decision allowing the federal right to same-sex marriage, protects not only gay marriage, but also interracial marriages and safeguards against other forms of discrimination. Approval by the Senate is still uncertain. Then there was the real shocker. Sens. Manchin and Chuck Schumer struck a deal that revived key elements of Biden’s agenda in a bill called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Now that Sinema has signed on, the law is set to  become the “BFD” that Biden and his supporters had been hoping for. If it passes, it would be the largest climate investment in US history. The bill will also instill a minimum tax on giant corporations that get away with paying little to nothing and make health care and drug prescriptions more affordable for millions of Americans. Despite its $433 billion price tag, the bill actually reduces the deficit. A review by Moody’s Analytics concluded it would check inflation, reduce the deficit and boost the economy while tackling climate change. The two main thrusts of the bill – the economy and the environment – have the power to move the electoral needle. For all the disappointment in Biden, which may stem in part from his subpar rhetorical prowess, Americans are also concerned about pocketbook issues.   And there are certainly bright spots on that front. Gas prices have now been sinking for more than 50 days. Fears that the Fed’s efforts to control inflation will send the economy into a deep recession appear to be easing. At least many investors seem to be having a change of heart – the S&P 500 has soared about 13% from its low in mid-June, and the Nasdaq is up about 16% over the same period. It’s a new bull market, some say. Adding to the good news for Democrats, voters in Kansas – Kansas! – turned out in huge numbers this week to defend abortion rights, suggesting a path to averting a much-predicted disaster in the November midterm elections. Democrats are pulling ahead when it comes to the public’s preference for party control of Congress. According to a recent Monmouth University poll released this week, 38% of Americans say they want the Democrats in charge, with another 12% saying they lean towards the party, compared to 34% who prefer Republican control with another 9% leaning toward the GOP.  Biden’s numbers, on the other hand, aren’t moving much. At least not yet. According to the Monmouth poll, Biden had a 38% approval rating – up 2% compared to June, but still a far cry from July 2021 – the last time he held a net positive rating (with 48% approving, compared to 44% disapproving.)   But if the Manchin-Schumer compromise passes, as seems likely, Biden’s standing with Democrats – especially younger voters – could get a boost. And if gas prices keep dropping, inflation starts easing, and the stock market doesn’t sink again, the bulk of the country – many of whom are not obsessed with politics – could start feeling more optimistic, helping Biden’s approval get some traction. For as long as he’s president, Biden will face the headwinds of shameless distortion by right-wing operatives, and he will suffer from not being the most charismatic, eloquent president at a time when the country’s very democracy is under threat. At this moment in his presidency, however, he can enjoy having scored a string of victories, and hope he has turned the tide.

382,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/europe/brittney-griner-trial-russia-tuesday/,"The examination of the substance contained in vape cartridges that WNBA star Brittney Griner’s carried at a Moscow airport in February did not comply with Russian law, a defense expert testified Tuesday in her high-stakes drug-smuggling trial.  Among the violations is that results of the examination do not show the amount of THC in the substance, Griner’s lawyer, Maria Blagovolina, said after the hearing. “The examination does not comply with the law in terms of the completeness of the study and does not comply with the norms of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” forensic chemist Dmitry Gladyshev testified for the defense during the roughly two-hour session. The defense also interrogated prosecution expert Alexander Korablyov, who examined Griner’s cartridges taken from her luggage. Griner’s appearance in the Khimki city courthouse marked her seventh hearing as Russian prosecutors accuse her of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. She has pleaded guilty to drug charges – a decision her lawyers hope will result in a less severe sentence – and faces up to 10 years in prison. Despite the guilty plea, the US State Department maintains she is wrongfully detained. Supporters of Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who plays in Russia during the WNBA offseason, have called for her release over fears she is being used as a political pawn amid Russia’s war on Ukraine. US officials face immense pressure from Griner’s family, lawmakers and the professional basketball community to bring her home, perhaps as part of a prisoner swap. Griner wrote to President Joe Biden pleading with him to do everything in his power to facilitate her release.  The 31-year-old sat Tuesday inside the defendant’s cage in the courtroom. The charge d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow, Elizabeth Rood, attended Tuesday’s hearing and afterward said the US would “continue to support Miss Griner through every step of this process and as long as it takes to bring her home to the United States safely.” Griner’s next hearing is set for Thursday. Outside the courthouse Tuesday, one of her lawyers told CNN that Griner is focused yet nervous about the coming verdict. “… She still knows that the end is near, and of course she heard the news so she’s hoping that sometime she could be coming home, and we hope, too,” Blagovolina said. Asked about their team’s strategy to challenge Russian prosecutors’ evidence, Blagovolina said: “Well there are a lot of factors which should be taken by the court into account. She admitted that she did bring something, but we need to know what did she bring. What substance?” Blagovolina also told CNN her team’s experts identified “a few defects” in the machines used to measure the substance. At trial, Griner has testified she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said. Attorneys make the case for an ‘improper’ detention  Griner’s attorneys have already laid out some arguments claiming the basketball player’s detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport. Her detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Alexander Boykov, one of her lawyers, said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.  After she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.  No lawyer was present, she testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest.  In her testimony, Griner “explained to the court that she knows and respects Russian laws and never intended to break them,” Blagovolina – a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin & Partners – said after last week’s hearing. The detained player testified she was aware of Russian laws and had no intention of bringing the cannabis oil into the country, noting she was in a rush and “stress packing.”  Griner confirmed she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis, Blagovolina said, which she uses to treat knee pain and joint inflammation.  “We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said. Kremlin decries ‘megaphone diplomacy’ The Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Speaking on a call with journalists, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.” “Megaphone diplomacy and public exchange of positions will not lead to results here,” Peskov added. The comments come less than a week after CNN reported that the Biden administration has proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and another American detainee, Paul Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, asking the US to also include a convicted murderer who was formerly a colonel with the Russian spy agency, Vadim Krasikov. US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer, the sources told CNN, in part because the proposal was sent through an informal backchannel. Krasikov’s release would also be complicated because he is in German custody.  “It’s a bad faith attempt to avoid a very serious offer and proposal that the United States has put forward and we urge Russia to take that offer seriously,” Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby told CNN, later adding, “We very much want to see Brittney and Paul come home to their families where they belong.” Griner’s family, supporters and WNBA teammates have continued to express messages of solidarity and hope as they wait for the conclusion of the trial. Before trial proceedings last week, the WNBA players union tweeted, “Dear BG … It’s early in Moscow. Our day is ending and yours is just beginning. Not a day, not an hour goes by that you’re not on our minds & in our hearts.” This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

340,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/business/starbucks-china/,"Starbucks sales took a plunge in China due to the country’s strict Covid-19 restrictions.  In the three months ending on July 3, sales at Starbucks’ Chinese locations open at least 13 months dropped 44%.  “China faced its most severe COVID disruption since the onset of the pandemic,” in the quarter, said Belinda Wong, chairman of Starbucks China, during a Tuesday analyst call discussing the results. “Mobility restrictions and lockdowns were implemented faster and eased more slowly under China’s zero-Covid policy,” she said, adding that Shanghai, Starbucks’ largest market, was totally locked down for about two-thirds of the quarter.   Starbucks’ international sales fell 18% in the quarter, dragged down by poor results in China. Discounting the sales drop there, international growth would have been up by double digits, the company said Tuesday.  China’s zero-Covid policy has made it difficult for individuals and companies to get back to business as usual. That’s a problem for Starbucks, which counts China as one of its most important markets. Starbucks has about 5,760 Chinese locations, and points to the region as a growth opportunity for the brand.   Even in light of the difficult quarter, “our position in the market and our aspirations for the future have never been greater” in China, Starbucks interim CEO Howard Schultz said during the call Tuesday. The situation has been improving as Covid restrictions ease, said Wong, noting that “we saw immediate improvement in traffic and sales following Shanghai’s reopening in early June.” She added that “we’re continuing our relentless focus on the long term even as we navigate short-term disruptions.” The company plans to have 6,000 locations open in China by the end of the year.  In other international markets, Starbucks has been rethinking its presence. Earlier this year, Starbucks said it was leaving Russia for good due to the war in Ukraine.   And the UK newspaper the Times said in July that Starbucks was considering whether it could or should sell its business in the United Kingdom. Starbucks said at the time that it was not engaged in a “formal sales process” and reiterated that it wanted to stay in the region. In the United States, where the company is battling a building unionization effort, sales have been growing. Sales at US stores open at least 13 months jumped 9% in the quarter.

428,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/ahmaud-arbery-killer-state-prison/,"One of the men found guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery fears being killed in state prison and wants to remain in federal custody for his safety, according to a court document filed by his attorney. Travis McMichael, along with his father Greg, and their neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan, was found guilty in the February 2020 shooting death of Arbery in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Brunswick in Glynn County, Georgia. They were convicted in November 2021 on the state murder charges. The McMichaels were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Bryan received a life sentence with the possibility of parole. In February, a  jury found the three guilty of all charges in their separate federal hate crimes trial, backing prosecutors’ case that the White men chased the 25-year-old through the streets of a Georgia neighborhood because he was Black. Sentence hearings for the three are due to begin on Monday at the federal courthouse in Brunswick.  Travis McMichael’s attorney Amy Lee Copeland filed a memorandum Thursday in federal court asking for her client to remain in the physical custody of the federal government because he is afraid he’ll be killed once in the Georgia state prison system.   McMichael has been held at the Glynn County Detention Center since his state arrest in May 2020, according to the memo, and has received threats that people “are ‘waiting for him,’ that he should not go into the yard, and that correctional officers have promised a willingness (whether for pay or for free) to keep certain doors unlocked and backs turned to allow inmates to harm him.”  “His concern is that he will promptly be killed upon delivery to the state prison system for service of that sentence: He has received numerous threats of death that are credible in light of all circumstances, and the government has a pending investigation into the Georgia DOC’s ability to keep inmates safe in a system where murder rates have tripled,” the memo said. It said McMichael had received hundreds of threats and “quit counting in January 2022, at around 800 threats.” Along with safety concerns, the memo also cites “the government’s investigation into the violence in Georgia state prisons,” as reasons that McMichael should remain in the physical custody of the federal government.   CNN has reached out to McMichael’s attorney for comment. Arbery’s family has objected to the killers serving time in federal instead of state prison. In January, a federal judge rejected a plea deal reached by prosecutors and Travis McMichael on the hate crime charges. McMichael had agreed to plead guilty to a single hate crime charge – interference with rights – in exchange for prosecutors recommending he serve 30 years in federal prison. Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones had urged the judge not to accept the plea. “Granting these men their preferred conditions of confinement would defeat me. It gives them one last chance to spit in my face after murdering my son,” Cooper-Jones told the judge.  S. Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery’s mother, had previously called federal prison “a country club compared to state prison,” saying the facilities were less populated, had better funding and were “generally more accommodating” than state holding facilities, according to tweets from his account.",Wanda Cooper-Jones;William Roddie Bryan;Travis Mcmichael;Travis Mcmichael;Travis Mcmichael;Ahmaud Arbery;Amy Lee Copeland,Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1168;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1865;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2168;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2317;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1168;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1865;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2168;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2317;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_WANDA,2794;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1893;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2182;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1893;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2182;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1893;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2182;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1893;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2182;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,238;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,2499;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,2827;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,3031;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,337;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1798;SOC_GENERALCRIME,508;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1968;TAX_FNCACT_KILLERS,2419;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,88;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,565;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,1237;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,1718;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,2467;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,2769;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,3120;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,3160;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,88;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,565;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1237;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1718;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,2467;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,2769;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,3120;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,3160;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,88;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,565;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1237;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1718;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2467;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2769;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,3120;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,3160;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,88;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,565;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1237;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1718;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2467;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2769;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3120;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3160;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,88;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,565;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1237;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1718;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2467;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2769;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,3120;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,3160;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISONS,2225;TRIAL,194;TRIAL,1024;TRIAL,2362;TRIAL,3063;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,194;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1024;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2362;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3063;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,1505;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1505;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1316;WB_840_JUSTICE,1316;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1316;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1649;KILL,72;KILL,1204;KILL,1684;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,72;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1204;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1684;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_CRIME,758;ARREST,125;ARREST,1142;ARREST,2291;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2200;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,2200;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2543;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2727;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,785;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,785;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,898;",Georgia;Glynn County;Satilla Shores
551,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/primary-election-august-9-what-to-watch/,"Primaries in the Upper Midwest on Tuesday will set the stage for two major governor’s races, as Republicans in Wisconsin and Minnesota select their nominees to take on those states’ Democratic incumbents in November.  Minnesota is also set to fill a House seat after former GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn died in February. Meanwhile, in Vermont, Rep. Peter Welch is running to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, which opens up the state’s lone House seat. The state’s lieutenant governor and its Senate president pro tempore – both Democrats – are vying to become the first woman to ever represent Vermont in Congress. Heavily Democratic Connecticut is also holding primaries on Tuesday, with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Gov. Ned Lamont up for reelection this fall.  Here are five things to watch in Tuesday’s primaries:  Trump vs. Pence in Wisconsin governor’s race The proxy battle over the future of the Republican Party between former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence continues Tuesday in Wisconsin, where a Pence-endorsed establishment favorite faces off against a Trump-backed outsider in a state where he has falsely claimed the 2020 election results were fraudulent. It’s a replay of similar gubernatorial primaries in recent weeks in Arizona, where Trump’s candidate won last week, and Georgia, where the Pence-backed Gov. Brian Kemp fended off a Trump-aligned challenger. In Wisconsin, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch entered the race as the GOP’s heir apparent in a battleground state long dominated by former Gov. Scott Walker. She spent eight years as Walker’s No. 2, and is backed by Pence and other establishment Republicans.  But then construction company owner Tim Michels entered the race, fueled by millions of dollars of his own wealth and a key endorsement. He is campaigning as an outsider, with Trump’s help; the former President at a recent rally said Kleefisch is “the handpicked candidate of the failed establishment, the RINOs.”  Both have embraced Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election. Kleefisch called the 2020 election “rigged,” but said she would not attempt to decertify its results because it is not legally possible to do so. Michels, however, said in a debate that “everything is on the table,” indicating he would entertain measures that would seek to decertify President Joe Biden’s victory in Wisconsin. The winner of the primary will take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who is seeking a second term in what’s expected to be one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial contests this fall. Another race to watch in Wisconsin is Assembly Speaker Robin Vos’ primary against little-known Adam Steen, who was endorsed by Trump after the former President decided Vos – a powerful Republican who had tried to appease Trump by hiring a former state Supreme Court justice to investigate the 2020 election – had done too little to try to overturn Wisconsin’s results. Vos said last month the former President had called him the week before as part of a fresh effort to decertify the state’s 2020 results. The Senate primary that wasn’t Two weeks ago, the Democratic Senate primary in Wisconsin was arguably the most closely watched primary contest on the left, pitting Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes against Alex Lasry, the Milwaukee Bucks executive who spent over $12 million of his own money on his campaign; Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski; and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. And then it wasn’t. After internal polls showed Barnes’ lead over his opponents growing, all three bowed out in the span of a few days, with Nelson, Lasry and Godlewski all endorsing the lieutenant governor. “I could not have imagined it ending up this way,” Barnes told CNN. “To me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the Democratic majority is.” The consolidation means Barnes and Democrats can pivot earlier to their end goal: defeating Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in November. Johnson, who opted to run for a third term after pledging in 2016 that his second term would be his last, has drawn Democratic ire for a host of comments on the coronavirus, the January 6, 2021, attack, and his personal wealth. But he has proven resilient in the past, ensuring that the Senate race in Wisconsin will be one of the closest watched contests of the 2022 cycle. Southern Minnesota gets a new congressman Voters in Southern Minnesota will select a new congressman on Tuesday after Rep. Jim Hagedorn died in February from kidney cancer. The special election, which comes at the same time Minnesota voters will vote in the regular 2022 primary, pits Republican Brad Finstad, the former head of USDA Rural Development for Minnesota, against Democrat Jeffrey Ettinger, who previously worked as CEO of Hormel Foods. The district, which stretches across Minnesota’s entire Southern border, leans toward Republicans. While voters select their congressman in the special election, they will also vote in the general election primary, selecting which candidates will get the chance to try to represent the district for a full term starting in 2023. Finstad and Ettinger are candidates in that race, as well. There are other contests worth watching in Minnesota, including well-funded challenges to incumbents. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar is being challenged by former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, while Rep. Betty McCollum is facing a challenge from progressive Amane Badhasso. Vermont paving the way for historic November Vermont is the only state to never send a woman to represent it in Congress – a distinction that, barring a major upset in November, is soon to change. On Tuesday, Democrats are likely to choose between state Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint and Lt. Gov. Molly Gray to be their nominee for the state’s lone House seat. (Physician Louis Meyers, the only man on the ballot, is expected to finish a distant third.)  Balint, endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other leading national progressives, is the left’s choice. Gray, meanwhile, has the unofficial backing of retiring Sen. Pat Leahy, who donated to her campaign through his PAC and said he voted for her. Leahy’s wife, Marcelle Leahy, formally endorsed Gray. Though there is very little room between Gray and Balint on the issues, Balint, who is gay, has been boosted by big spending from the LGBTQ Victory Fund’s PAC – which has spent nearly $1 million on the race – and the campaign arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Recent polling of the race has shown Balint with a commanding lead, but some observers expect the final tally to be much closer. If Balint wins a close race, the decision by state Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale to end her campaign and endorse Balint – in a bid to consolidate the left – could loom large. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz gets his Republican challenger Another high-stakes race for control of state governments in the Upper Midwest will come into clearer focus on Tuesday, as Minnesota Republicans choose their nominee for governor. The state party has already made its selection, endorsing Scott Jensen, a doctor and former state senator. Jensen is the overwhelming favorite in a GOP contest with Joyce Lynne Lacey and Bob “Again” Carney Jr. Jensen is a fierce critic of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz’s initial Covid-19 response and, at a recent forum, called the incumbent’s mitigation measures at the beginning of the pandemic an “abomination of government overreach.” Jensen’s past remarks downplaying Covid, including a past assertion that hospitals were inflating the number of cases to collect more stimulus money, was cited in PolitiFact’s post on its 2020 “Lie of the Year.” He also touted his unvaccinated status over the past year as he rose to greater political prominence, sowing doubts over the safety and efficacy of the shots. Jensen has also been an outspoken critic of abortion, an issue that is certain to be at the forefront of Democratic efforts to define him as too extreme after abortion rights supporters scored a notable victory in Kansas earlier this month. Jensen appeared to soften his position on abortion in late July, saying in a taped video that he supports allowing abortions for victims of rape or incest or if the life of the mother is threatened. He told Minnesota Public Radio in March that he would “try to ban abortion” as governor. Walz has been attacking Jensen’s abortion stance for weeks, framing the general election as a referendum on the issue. “This isn’t a nuanced position between myself and my opponent,” Walz said in June. “This is far as the Grand Canyon could be in how we view women and how we view health care.” This story has been updated with additional information.

360,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/robert-fenton-white-house-monkeypox-response-coordinator/,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday formally named Robert Fenton as the White House’s national monkeypox response coordinator. Fenton, a regional Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator who oversees Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada, will coordinate the federal government’s response to the outbreak, while Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s director of the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, will serve as the deputy coordinator. “Fenton and Daskalakis will lead the Administration’s strategy and operations to combat the current monkeypox outbreak, including equitably increasing the availability of tests, vaccinations and treatments,” the White House said in a statement announcing the team. The first US monkeypox case in this outbreak was confirmed May 17, and the virus has spread rapidly to reach more than 5,800 probable or confirmed cases, nearly all of them in men who have sex with men. Getting the outbreak under control has been a challenge for the CDC and the Biden administration. As CNN previously reported, testing for monkeypox, a crucial part of containing the growing outbreak, has gotten off to a slow start at the five commercial laboratories that have nearly all the US’ monkeypox testing capacity. The World Health Organization last month declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern. But so far, monkeypox has not been declared a federal public health emergency in the US, with American health officials having said the US is still assessing the situation.  Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid coordinator, recently told reporters that the WHO’s declaration “will allow the United States and other partners to better collaborate, to share data and to get critical information out to high-risk communities.” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement last month that the US was “determined to accelerate our response in the days ahead.” ",Robert Fenton;Xavier Becerra;Ashish Jha,Us Health;White House;White House;White House;Human Services;World Health Organization;Us Centers For Disease;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States;United States;United States;Emergency Management Agency,"HEALTH_VACCINATION,686;TAX_FNCACT_DEPUTY,485;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,304;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,304;MEDIA_MSM,1669;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1796;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,419;TAX_DISEASE_HIV,442;GENERAL_HEALTH,389;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,389;WB_1406_DISEASES,389;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,389;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1856;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1376;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1479;ARMEDCONFLICT,581;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,410;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,458;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,410;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,458;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,410;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,458;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,410;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,458;WB_2026_PREVENTION,410;WB_2026_PREVENTION,458;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,179;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1376;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1479;TAX_DISEASE_HIV_AIDS,447;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,1631;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,1505;ECON_DEVELOPMENTORGS_WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION,1320;TAX_AIDGROUPS_WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION,1320;MEDICAL,1307;MEDICAL,1366;MEDICAL,1469;MEDICAL,1512;MEDICAL,1848;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,329;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,612;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,820;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,979;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1159;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,329;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,612;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,820;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,979;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1159;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,329;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,612;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,820;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,979;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1159;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,329;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,612;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,820;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,979;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1159;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,329;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,612;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,820;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,979;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1159;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,329;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,612;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,820;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,979;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1159;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,211;TAX_AIDGROUPS_FEDERAL_EMERGENCY_MANAGEMENT_AGENCY,197;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,197;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1401;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,117;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,603;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,798;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1107;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1258;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1350;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1423;LEADER,14;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,14;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,14;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1522;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,138;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,497;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,1643;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,83;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,717;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1610;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1875;",Hawaii;White House;Nevada;United States;Arizona;California;American
215,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/wisconsin-stabbing-apple-river/,"A 17-year-old boy died Saturday, and four others were wounded when they were stabbed while riding inner tubes down a river in western Wisconsin, according to the St. Croix County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Scott Knudson told CNN multiple witnesses called law enforcement when the stabbing occurred on the Apple River near Somerset, Wisconsin, and the victims and the suspect are believed to have been tubing. The attack happened Saturday afternoon. “It was a tragic, shocking sight for families floating down the river,” he said. The victims were tubing with two different groups, with a total of around 20 people, according to CNN affiliate WLUK-TV. The television station reports investigators are still working to determine whether the suspect knew the victims and what led to the stabbing. Deputies were able to locate a suspect, a 52-year-old man from Minnesota, with the help of a witness who had taken a photograph of the person. WLUK-TV reported the suspect was arrested around an hour and a half after the stabbing while he was leaving the river downstream. Knudson said the suspect, who has not been identified, is in custody. A 17-year-old boy from Minnesota died in the stabbing, and a woman and three men – all of whom are believed to be in their 20s – were critically injured. Two of the victims were flown to a hospital in the Minneapolis and two were taken there by ambulance, WLUK-TV said. The names of the victims are also being withheld at this time, according to a Facebook post from the sheriff’s office. Knudson said the Apple River is a popular destination in the Minneapolis / St. Paul area. The attack occurred in a section of the river about 35 miles east of Minneapolis, according to WLUK-TV.",Scott Knudson,Facebook;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Croix County Sheriff Office,"MEDIA_SOCIAL,1516;WOUND,61;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,61;MEDIA_MSM,682;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,373;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,558;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,780;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1319;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1453;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,373;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,558;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,780;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1319;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1453;KILL,26;KILL,1197;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,26;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1197;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,270;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1412;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1412;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1412;WB_1324_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SERVICES,1412;GENERAL_HEALTH,1344;MEDICAL,1344;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1344;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,187;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,205;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,1538;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,187;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,205;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1538;SECURITY_SERVICES,270;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,270;WB_840_JUSTICE,270;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,270;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,270;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,270;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,270;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,863;LEGISLATION,258;EPU_POLICY_LAW,258;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1301;ARREST,991;SOC_GENERALCRIME,991;",Minnesota;Minneapolis;Apple River;Wisconsin
631,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/europe/ukraine-grain-hunger-crisis-world-intl/,"As the Razoni left the Ukrainian port of Odesa on Monday with the first shipment of grain since the early days of Russia’s war in Ukraine, there were sighs of relief from Somalia to Turkey, Indonesia and China, given how reliant these countries have been on Ukrainian grain to meet their daily needs.  Millions of people have been pushed into hunger as the Russian blockade fueled soaring grain commodity prices, which reached record highs this year as more than 20 million metric tons of Ukrainian wheat and corn remained trapped in Odesa.  But even as the UN-brokered agreement to lift the blockade has eased grain prices, experts say the belated shipments from Ukraine are no quick fix to the crisis, accelerated by years of pandemic-related disruptions, the climate crisis, conflict, food export restrictions and spiraling costs.  All these interacting factors “are going to remain for some time,” Laura Wellesley, a senior research fellow at think tank Chatham House’s environment and society program, told CNN. “It may be that we see peaks in food prices again, and peaks in food insecurity, but certainly not a resolution of the situation anytime soon.”  Global hunger has increased massively, from 135 million people acutely food insecure in 2019 to 345 million in 2022, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). It includes “50 million people in 45 countries that are knocking on famine’s door,” David Beasley, WFP’s executive director, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 20, as he called on other donor countries, like Gulf nations, to step in an “avert catastrophe.”    Today’s crisis is far worse than the previous food price spikes of 2007 to 2008 and 2010 to 2012, which both fueled riots around the world, including revolutions in the Middle East.   Food security experts have warned of huge geopolitical risk if action is not taken. This year has already witnessed political destabilization in “Sri Lanka, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, riots and protests taking place in Kenya, Peru, Pakistan, Indonesia … these are only signs things to come is going to get worse,” Beasley said.      Hunger hotspots   In the Horn of Africa, a four-year drought has led to food insecurity and starvation, according to aid groups. Somalian health facilities are seeing record levels of malnutrition following years of failed rainy seasons, a doubling of wheat prices and the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.   Ijabu Hassan lost three children to malnutrition this year, telling CNN that her 2-year-old daughter collapsed and died on their trek to the capital, Mogadishu, to seek help. “I cried so much,” she said, “I lost consciousness.”   As desperate parents like Hassan seek reprieve, the UN estimates 7 million people — or over half of Somalia’s population — simply do not have enough to eat.   Meanwhile, Afghans have seen their lives go from bad to worse since the Taliban seized power in 2021. After the United States’ hasty withdrawal from the country last August, Washington and its allies cut off international funding to the country, which has run heavily on aid for years, and froze about $7 billion of the country’s foreign reserves.  Afghanistan’s economic crisis has loomed for years, the result of poverty, conflict and drought. But this year, as below average harvests led to unprecedented levels of hunger across the country, long lines for aid have become ubiquitous even in the capital Kabul’s middle-class neighborhoods.   Longstanding conflict in countries like Somalia and Afghanistan has impacted people’s ability to access food, and the climate crisis is only worsening the situation. Droughts in main crop-producing regions, like Europe and North America, have pushed food prices upwards.   Extreme weather across parts of North Africa is a chilling reminder that, blockade or no blockade, food supply here is highly insecure anyway. The region is dependent on wheat from Europe, especially Ukraine. Tunisia, for example, gets nearly half its wheat from the country to make its daily bread.   Data from EarthDaily Analytics, obtained using satellite imagery, shows just how hard it is for some nations here to cover any of the gap themselves. Looking at crop cover in Morocco, the images suggest a “catastrophic wheat season” in the country, with output far lower than in recent years, because of a drought that began there at the end of 2021 and continued into early this year.  Morocco gets a fifth of its wheat from Ukraine and a larger 40% from France, according to Mickael Attia, crop analyst for EarthDaily Analytics.   “The current drought in North Africa, specifically Morocco, is profoundly impacting their ability to produce their own crops, not to mention that in the past, Ukraine was one of the largest exporters of food to the country. The cost to replace that is very high and a struggle,” Attia told CNN.  “The country needs the import for structural reasons – every year national consumption is far higher than production – and because the country is regularly exposed to massive weather events, drought and climate change will make things worse in the future.”  Ukraine’s wheat production, too, is expected to be 40% lower than last year’s, as its fields are impacted by the war; fertilizer and pesticides are harder to get; but also because of an early spring cold pattern and dryness in the country’s west, Attia said, adding that the impacts could last well into next year.  “If Ukrainian grains are partially, physically missing because of low production and difficulties in exporting then, this will lead to greater food insecurity this year and next,” he said.  Other major wheat exporters have also been hit hard by extreme weather exacerbated by climate change. France too should produce 8% less wheat than last year, Attia said. “May was dry in most of Europe, and crazy hot in Western Europe, impacting crops from France and Spain, especially,” Attia said. “June was also a dry and hot month in most of Europe, and accelerated the decrease in crops in France, Spain and Romania.”  Pandemic and protectionism    Meanwhile, many countries’ efforts to alleviate food insecurity were undone in the pandemic. It plunged the global economy into recession in 2020, upending supply chains and causing employment and transport problems. Governments began to face inflationary pressure and global food prices began to soar as production disruption and high demand from countries like China were “really tightening that balance between supply and demand and pushing up prices,” said Wellesley, from Chatham House.  Economies of poorer countries have been left in tatters while middle income nations have incurred large debts, limiting their governments’ ability to offer social safety nets and provisions that would help the most vulnerable through this food supply crisis, she added.   In Peru and Brazil, people working in the large informal jobs sector lost their savings and earning power during the pandemic’s lockdowns. “So these people moved from middle classes to poor… in Brazil the number of people living in severe food insecurity is extremely high,” Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told CNN.   In 2021, a record 36% of Brazilians were at risk of going hungry, surpassing the world average for the first time, according to the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), a Brazilian academic institution, which analyzed Gallup data.    The war has brought home just how many people and countries have come to rely on a complex and globalized commodities system. Europe’s dependency on Russian gas has exposed its vulnerabilities. While countries like Turkey, Egypt, Somalia, Congo and Tanzania are some of the most dependent on Ukrainian and Russian wheat, nations like Eritrea bought the grain exclusively from the two nations in 2021.   Analysts suggest the supply chain crisis might lead to more localized or regional sourcing strategies – but that might take a while.   “Let me give you an example – Africa uses 3% of the fertilizers in the world,” Torero said, yet Dangote’s fertilizer plant in Nigeria sends 95.5% of its product to Latin America. “Nothing stays in Africa. It is not that (the) Dangote plant does not want to export in Africa, it’s (because) there are too many barriers to export (to other parts of) Africa,” he said, adding that the infrastructure was poor and the risk high.   Going the other way and imposing protectionist policies is also problematic. As food prices exploded following Russia’s invasion, countries began restricting exports. India, the world’s largest producer of sugar, limited sugar exports to 10 million tons and banned wheat exports. Today, more than 20 countries have some sort of export restrictions in place, dashing hopes that these items might help alleviate hunger elsewhere.   “That has an immediate effect of pushing up prices, but over time, it also is kind of eroding trust and predictability in the global market,” Wellesley said.   Then there is the issue of fertilizer prices that remain high because it is energy intensive to produce and Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of its key components: urea, potash and phosphate.   Some analysts warn that as usage of fertilizer goes down, we will see smaller yields in 2023. And while the main concern has rested on grain supplies, some worry that the production of rice, a cornerstone of many diets in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, could take a hit amid high fertilizer costs.   Even if there are currently high inventories of rice, protectionism and people turning to rice as a substitute for wheat could impact prices. “Sub-Saharan Africa imports the most rice in the world, so if the price of rice goes up, then the most vulnerable countries will be substantially affected,” Torero of the FAO said.    The Razoni, a Sierre Leone-registered ship currently en route to Lebanon, is carrying around 26,500 metric tons of corn. “To meet 2021 August shipment levels, we’d have to see seven of those ships happen every single day for things to actually get back to where we were,” Jonathan Haines, a senior analyst at commodity data group Gro Intelligence, told CNN. There is a lot of uncertainty if that can happen, but flow is undoubtably “going to really pick up,” he added. The Ukrainian government and the Turkish Defense Ministry said three more ships were expected to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Friday laden with grain. As and when wheat prices drop to pre-war levels, Torero worries that the return of Ukrainian and Russian grain on the markets could further reduce wheat prices and in the process impoverish poor farmers, who shouldered high fertilizer and energy costs to plant their crops.  Just as the food crisis has had wide and varying impacts on people, the solutions are complex and multifaceted. These include improvements in how fertilizers are used, investments in social safety nets, decoupling food production from fossil fuel dependence while slashing greenhouse gas emissions, and a push to make the agricultural sector more resilient to global shocks by diversifying production and trade relationships, experts say.    “These all seem like things to tackle another day given the severity of the current situation. They are not,” Wellesley said. “They are problems contributing to today’s situation (and) will recur over the years to come – particularly as climate impacts continue to worsen.”  ",Jonathan

163,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/monkeypox-public-health-emergency/,"The Biden administration on Thursday declared monkeypox a public health emergency, with cases on the rise across the US. The announcement came during a briefing with the Department of Health and Human Services.  The administration has been criticized at times for its handling of the outbreak, and some have called on the government to declare a national emergency without delay.  Since the first US monkeypox case was identified in mid-May, more than 6,600 probable or confirmed cases have been detected in the United States. Cases have been identified in every state except Montana and Wyoming. The declaration follows the World Health Organization announcement last month that monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.” Some cities and states, including New York City, San Francisco, California, Illinois and New York, have already declared monkeypox an emergency, allowing them to free up funding and resources for their responses to the outbreak. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden named Robert Fenton as the White House’s national monkeypox response coordinator. Fenton – a regional Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator who oversees Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada – will coordinate the federal government’s response to the outbreak. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s director of the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, serves as the deputy coordinator. The Biden administration has been heavily criticized by some public health experts for not moving faster to address the crisis. One of the criticisms of the administration’s response, as CNN reported earlier Thursday, was that HHS waited more than three weeks after the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the US to order bulk stocks of the monkeypox vaccine, which the government owns and stores in Denmark, be bottled and sent to the US for distribution. The delay was in part out of concern that once those vaccines were taken out of bulk storage, they would lose years of shelf life. Monkeypox can infect anyone, but the majority of cases in the US outbreak have been among men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men and people who identify as transgender. Close contact with an infected individual is required for the spread of the monkeypox virus, experts say. The CDC initially announced vaccines for monkeypox were being released from the Strategic National Stockpile and offered to the “high-risk” contacts of monkeypox patients, as well as the health care workers treating them. Federal health officials have since expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that makes up most US monkeypox cases. In addition to providing vaccines, the CDC has said since June it has made a concerted effort to do extensive education and outreach to the LGBTQ community. Possible change to how vaccine is administered Health officials are considering changing the way monkeypox vaccine doses are administered because the country is “at a critical inflection point” with the virus’ spread, US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told reporters on Thursday.  “In recent days, it’s become clear to all of us that given the continued spread of the virus, we’re at a critical inflection point, dictating the need for additional solutions to address the rise in infection rates,” Califf said. “The goal has always been to vaccinate as many people as possible.” The commissioner said officials are considering allowing health care providers to be able to use a dose-sharing method where one vial of Jynneos vaccine – previously used as one dose – will be used to administer up to five separate doses.  This approach would change the way Jynneos is administered, Califf said. Instead of the vaccine being administered in the fat layer under the skin, it will be delivered underneath the skin layer. “There are some advantages to intradermal administration including an improved immune response to the vaccine,” Califf said. “It’s important to note that overall safety and efficacy profile will not be sacrificed for this approach. Please know, we’ve been exploring all scientifically feasible options and we believe this could be a promising approach.” This story has been updated with additional information.

284,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/michigan-abortion-ban-enforcement-appeals-court-ruling/,"A Michigan judge on Monday granted Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s request to temporarily block enforcement of the state’s pre-Roe abortion ban. Hours earlier, an appellate court said in a separate case that county officials were free to bring such prosecutions, concluding that a lower court’s ruling blocking enforcement of the pre-Roe ban only applied to state officials.  The 1931 criminal abortion ban – which has not been enforced while Roe v. Wade’s protection for abortion rights were on the books – has been the subject of litigation in the state in the lead-up up to and after the US Supreme Court’s recent ruling reversing the Roe precedent.  “Today’s dangerous decision by the Michigan Court of Appeals clears a path for county prosecutors to use Michigan’s extreme 1931 abortion ban to prosecute doctors and nurses and jail them for doing their jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement announcing her request for the temporary restraining order.  Michigan’s abortion ban states: “Any person who shall wilfully (sic) administer to any pregnant woman any medicine, drug, substance or thing whatever, or shall employ any instrument or other means whatever, with intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of any such woman” is guilty of a felony.  It has an exception to “preserve the life” of the woman but not in cases of rape of incest.  The law threatens abortion providers with prison time, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan.  Abortion rights advocates in the state, including Whitmer, had warned that it could be enforced if the Supreme Court overturned Roe. In hopes of avoiding that, Whitmer also sued to block the law from going into effect.  “The most important economic decision a woman makes in her lifetime is when and whether to have a child and this court decision threatens to rip that away from every woman in the country,” the governor previously said. “It’s going to be up to governors and that’s why this fight is so important.”  Monday’s appeal court order came in a separate case filed initially in the Michigan Court of Claims by Planned Parenthood of Michigan. In that case, a judge blocked enforcement of the abortion ban in May, but on Monday, the appeals court said that the judge’s ruling only applied to state officials – leaving county prosecutors free to enforce the law.  The appellate court ruling prompted Whitmer to successfully seek a temporary restraining order from the 6th Judicial Circuit Court for the County of Oakland, which is where Whitmer had launched litigation in April seeking a ruling that would strike down the 1931 abortion ban under Michigan’s Constitution. Planned Parenthood of Michigan said in a statement after Monday morning’s appeals court ruling that its doors remain open and that it “will continue to provide abortion services in accordance with the law.” The organization pointed to court rules that say appeals court rulings do not take effect for 21 days to give the parties the opportunity to appeal. But, before the more TRO was issued on Monday afternoon, anti-abortion activists said county prosecutors could enforce the ban immediately.

605,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/christopher-wray-terrorist-attacks/,"FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday expressed concern over potential terrorist attacks on US soil emanating from Afghanistan, citing “growing intelligence gaps” since the US pulled its troops out of the country in 2021. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Wray, “Are you worried about an attack on the homeland emanating from places like Afghanistan?” “We are,” Wray responded. “Especially now that we’re out, I’m worried about the potential loss of sources and (intelligence) collection over there.” The FBI director added that he was worried terrorists in the US could be inspired by the potential growth of terrorist organizations in  Afghanistan. “I’m worried about the possibility that we will see al Qaeda reconstitute, ISIS-K potentially taking advantage of the deteriorating security environment, and I’m worried about terrorists, including here in the United States, being inspired by what they see over there,” Wray said. His comments come just days after the US killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan via drone strike. In announcing the operation, President Joe Biden said Monday, “I made a promise to the American people that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond. We’ve done just that.” Biden pledged that Zawahiri “will never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven, because he is gone and we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.” Still, when asked Thursday whether he was surprised that Zawahiri was living in Afghanistan, Wray said he was “not surprised, but disappointed.” Wray’s comments echo a “worldwide caution update” issued by the State Department earlier this week in the wake of Zawahiri’s death. “The Department of State believes there is a higher potential for anti-American violence given the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri on July 31, 2022,” the notice said.  “Current information suggests that terrorist organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in multiple regions across the globe,” it described. “These attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics including suicide operations, assassinations, kidnappings, hijackings, and bombings.” CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.

690,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/asia/taiwan-joseph-wu-interview-china-military-drills-intl-hnk/,"China’s threat to Taiwan is “more serious than ever,” but the island will stand firm to protect its freedom and democracy – including by welcoming those who support it, Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told CNN in an interview Monday.  Wu’s defiant message came as China said it continued military drills around the self-governing island, after a four-day show of force following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taipei last week. “China has always been threatening Taiwan for years and it’s getting more serious in the last few years,” Wu said. “Whether Speaker Pelosi visits Taiwan or not, the Chinese military threat against Taiwan has always been there and that is the fact that we need to deal with.” Welcoming overseas friends to the island was a key part of Taiwan’s strategy to counter China’s attempts to isolate it from the international community – regardless of the potential backlash from Beijing, Wu said. “(China) cannot dictate to Taiwan that we should not welcome anyone who likes to come and show support for Taiwan,” said Wu, who has served as Taiwan’s foreign minister since 2018. Pelosi’s Taiwan trip – the first by a sitting House Speaker to the island in 25 years – was vehemently opposed by China’s ruling Communist Party, which views Taiwan as its territory despite never having controlled it.  In the wake of Pelosi’s visit, Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan, including via economic penalties, the launch of missiles over the island for the first time, and drills that Taipei has said were meant to “simulate” an attack against its main island and navy. Though those exercises were originally expected to end Sunday, drills around Taiwan continued Monday, according to an announcement from China’s military. But as the live-fire drills raised global fears of a possible military conflict, the mood in Taiwan remained calm, with life carrying on as usual with packed restaurants and crowded public transport. For Wu, the threat made it even more critical that Taiwan continue to build its international relationships and show it is not afraid. “I worry that China may really launch a war against Taiwan,” he said. “But what it is doing right now is trying to scare us and the best way to deal with it (is) to show to China that we are not scared.” Pelosi in Taiwan  Though her trip was long mooted and much discussed, Taiwanese officials only received short notice of her arrival, Wu said.  “Since her travel is always subject to a lot of considerations, especially security considerations … we were not able to find out until the very last moment when she firmed up her plan,” Wu said, adding Taipei knew the itinerary a few days beforehand, but not the exact timing of her arrival.  The visit from the speaker and an accompanying congressional delegation included meetings at Taiwan’s legislature and the office of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, where Pelosi said they came to send an “unequivocal message” that “America stands with Taiwan.” Wu said his most memorable impression of the trip was greeting Pelosi and the delegation at the airport, where she “showed her charm” by saying she’d been looking forward to her visit for a long time.  “And by the time she departed, she not only said goodbye to me, but also said goodbye to the ground crew, the security people, and to those people who had been taking care of the airport, one by one,” Wu said. When asked whether the United States would increase its support for Taiwan after the visit, Wu said the US has always been “highly supportive” of Taiwan – but the current support was “unprecedented.” In an exclusive interview with CNN last October, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed some US military trainers were in Taiwan – the first time a Taiwanese leader had admitted to their presence since Washington and Taipei severed diplomatic ties in 1979. But perceptions of American support sparked Beijing’s ire against the speaker’s visit, with China’s foreign ministry issuing a statement on the heels of Pelosi’s arrival Tuesday evening saying her trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations,” and “gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.” Beijing announced the large-scale military exercises in what it said were six zones around the island of Taiwan swiftly after Pelosi’s arrival, in response to what it viewed as an infringement of China’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity.”  While the US and many of its allies have decried the drills, China defended its actions as “legitimate and justified,” saying it was the US, not China, who was “the biggest saboteur and destabilizer of peace in the Taiwan Strait,” where China claims “sovereign rights and jurisdiction.” ‘Wrecking’ the status quo Taiwan and China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago, in which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei. Taiwan transitioned from authoritarian rule to a democracy in the 1990s, and is now ranked one of the freest jurisdictions in Asia by Freedom House, a US-based non-profit organization. In recent years, as his power has grown, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made clear his ambitions to “reunify” with the island – by force if necessary.    Wu accused China of trying to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, including by conducting military exercises in recent days across the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China that has previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei.  Dozens of Chinese warplanes crossed the median line between Thursday and Sunday, according to accounts from Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. While the informal median line has largely preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait for decades, China now openly denies its existence.  “This kind of behavior is wrecking the status quo, and it’s wrecking peace and stability in this region and it should not be accepted,” Wu said, adding that China had sought to declare the Taiwan Strait as its internal waters for “some time” before Pelosi’s visit. That had implications beyond Taiwan as China seeks to expand its influence across the Western Pacific, Wu said. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future. “Democracy is going to prevail,” he said. “If you look at authoritarianism, it’s not resilient. It may appear strong, and it may appear to be expanding. But it’s not resilient and at some point is going to break.” When asked if the situation could be called a crisis, Wu said that was ultimately up to Beijing. “It depends on the will of the Chinese leaders to see whether they want to pursue the relations with Taiwan … in a peaceful and stable manner.” Wu said he doesn’t know whether Chinese leaders “have made up their mind” to use force to take Taiwan, but Taiwanese officials were “looking at several different scenarios,” in particular due to concerns that Beijing could seek to divert attention from domestic problems by creating a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.    “The important thing for us is that we need to be prepared,” Wu said. “We want to defend the freedom and democracy that we enjoy over here. Nobody can take that away from us.”",Joseph Wu;Joseph Wu;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi,Taiwan Defense Ministry;Cnn;Cnn;Freedom House;Taiwan Military News Agency;Taiwanese Foreign Ministry Anadolu Agency Getty Images;United States;United States,"EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,2806;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2008;ARMEDCONFLICT,2140;ARMEDCONFLICT,5077;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,7039;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,7187;BORDER,5786;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2522;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3518;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,2373;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,2883;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,3055;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,3155;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,3974;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,6155;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,7253;TAX_FNCACT_TRAINERS,3924;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4120;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1839;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1839;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,193;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,1095;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,3072;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,1253;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1572;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,3981;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,5396;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,390;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,565;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,1171;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,2774;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,3017;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,4175;LEADER,2893;LEADER,3876;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2893;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3876;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2105;REBELLION,5077;WB_739_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_CIVIL_WAR,5077;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,5077;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,5077;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1253;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1839;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,4338;EPU_ECONOMY,1432;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1432;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,1247;WB_137_WATER,6473;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,5193;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1221;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1958;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,193;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1095;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3072;SOVEREIGNTY,4664;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,305;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1510;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1677;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1787;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4748;DEMOCRACY,115;DEMOCRACY,5213;DEMOCRACY,6692;DEMOCRACY,7577;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,115;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,5213;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,6692;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,7577;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,3139;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,3304;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,3585;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,3139;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,3304;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,3585;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,3139;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,3304;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,3585;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2383;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,7263;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,13;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,622;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,1981;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,606;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5389;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5854;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,7031;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,7179;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,606;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5389;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5854;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,7031;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,7179;",Taiwan;Taiwan Strait;United States;America;Chinese;Washington;Songshan;Beijing;Hualien;Taipei;American;Taiwanese;China
601,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/17/opinions/w-kamau-bell-kate-schatz-do-the-work-carr/,"Editor’s Note: The CNN Original Series “United Shades of America” airs on Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT.  What do you get when a sociopolitical comedian teams up with a best-selling children’s book author to write a book about fighting racism in America?  When those two people are W. Kamau Bell, host of CNN’s “United Shades of America,” and Kate Schatz, author of the best-selling “Rad Women” children’s books, you get “Do the Work! An Antiracist Activity Book” (Workman Publishing) – a workbook for adults filled with exercises, coloring pages, information about historical figures, lists of things (big and small) you can do to change the world, guidance on how to have tough conversations (with yourself, your family, your colleagues and your kids) and most of all, pages and pages of witty dialogue between its authors.  The book began in the wake of the racial reckoning that followed the murder of George Floyd. Bell and Schatz – already friends and fellow denizens of the East Bay area of California – kept having conversations about how to deal with White people who wanted to know: “What do I do?” Bell suggested they write a book together and during the first Zoom about the project, a simultaneous light bulb flared: “We both pitched an activity book or a workbook,” said Schatz.  According to her, “I blame that in large part on the fact that we’re both parents who had been pandemic schooling our kids. So we thought, maybe we could do some kind of activity book for adults, because all these big, scholarly tomes on the history of racial injustice perhaps weren’t getting through to everybody.” Said Bell: “After I wrote my first book, I was like, ‘I will never, ever write another book again.’ And then this idea came to me, and I was like ‘I think I would only do it with Kate.’”  Schatz, who is White, was resolute in not only collaborating with Bell but also with other Black artists and designers for such a visually-driven book. She gives a particular shoutout to designers Tré Seals and Dian Holton and praised all the many collaborators on the project, especially in book publishing, an industry that has long struggled to diversify.  So how do you write an activity book for adults about how – in this topsy-turvy, pandemic-riddled, just-make-the-headlines-stop world – to do something as overwhelming as fighting racism? If you’re a parent familiar with Schatz’s previous work in books such as “Rad American Women A to Z” and “Rad Women Worldwide” (guilty) you might not be surprised that Schatz cites a classic activist adage: think globally, act locally.  “It’s how I think about storytelling,” she adds. “How do we connect a really big thing to this immediate moment we’re living in?…. Here’s a specific thing you could do tomorrow” – just one example in the chock-full book includes putting numbers for the fire department, domestic violence and suicide hotlines in your phone, so calling the police for any emergency is no longer your default – “that to me is a concrete detail that lands it for a reader, especially when you’re dealing with a very big topic that could seem abstract.”  For Bell, “I’m just trying to make it clear that there’s more work to do, that just ‘cause you had the [difficult] conversation doesn’t mean you did the work. It is super important always to lead people with ‘What more can you do? What’s next?’” Bell and Schatz spoke with CNN Opinion about their book and how they see the world.  This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did your different experiences as a children’s book author and a comedian and commentator inform your project?  W. Kamau Bell: For me, so much of this book comes from being parents. How do you get people to learn things they don’t want to learn? Or how do you get people to value information they don’t value?  Kate Schatz: One thing I’ve come to realize in this collaboration is how much our respective, separate careers are similar. My work writing children’s books of complicated histories about women that a lot of people haven’t heard of (laughs) is not that different from the work I did as a high school teacher, which is not that different from my work as a parent. I think there are a lot of parallels with Kamau’s work as a TV commentator and a stand-up comic, which – again, that it’s about trying to communicate with an audience that maybe doesn’t want to hear you. So we both have these different, complementary kind of tactics of how we convey important, complex ideas in a way that’s funny and appealing, whether it’s parenting and trying to convince [our children] to do something, whether it’s getting high school students to care about a 19th century novel or getting my readers to be engaged in histories and people that they’ve never heard of. I’ve always felt with children’s books, I don’t think the kids need complicated ideas to be dumbed down, I think they can handle really difficult things. I also don’t think that we need to water down and dumb down complicated things for adults either. I think there are ways we can speak very directly and very candidly about controversial things to an audience that are still engaging and entertaining but don’t try to pretend otherwise. CNN: One thing that stuck out to me while reading the book was Kate’s comment in the introduction – that among a lot of other things, the book is for people who go to protests and think to themselves afterward, “What next?” Given what’s happened over the past few weeks, especially for those who may have been protesting now for generations and are confronting how things are evolving, I’m curious – how do you feel about this moment that your book is entering the world?  Schatz: I’m just completely devastated and enraged and so overwhelmed by all of it. But, despite those feelings, it’s actually fueling my excitement for this book to be in the world because that’s what this book is about, really: how to figure out what to do in the face of daunting and overwhelming horror.  And a lot of it is about getting people to think creatively, to think locally and to recognize that activism and change-making exist on a spectrum. Protesting is one really important part of the spectrum, but it’s not safe for everybody, it’s not accessible for everybody and it’s not the end all, be all. Neither is voting and neither is donating money. All of these things are pieces of a bigger puzzle.   In this book, I hope that readers can find some form of like, “Oh, this is a thing I could be doing,” or, “I could do this,” or, “I could do that.” Because it’s just very easy to feel paralyzed, like nothing matters. So yes, you protested and this terrible thing still happened, so what next? We definitely don’t have the answers, but we have a lot of ideas.  CNN: One of the things in the book is a set of affirmations for the reader, one of which is that they are now a “practicing anti-racist.” The idea then being that it’s an iterative process, something you have to keep practicing at to get better. Speaking of practice, and this is for both of you, what’s your favorite exercise in the book? Bell: I’m a big fan of the “check your privilege” checklist just ‘cause I think it really expands the idea of what privilege is. And even though there are many jokes in there, none of them are jokey. I used to say about myself, “I tell jokes but I’m not kidding.” I saw somebody who zoomed in on [the exercise] on Instagram and said, “Tall? Is that a joke? So you’re saying tall is a privilege?” And I’m like, “It’s not a joke at all. I’m tall, I know it’s a privilege.” I love the fact that embedded in there are lots of jokes, but it also makes people think differently about privilege. My favorite one is, “Are you George Clooney?” That’s a privilege, if you’re George Clooney. This idea of privilege gets so corrupted and confused – and made so boring – that to me, I feel like that exercise did a great job of being actually funny, but not joking at all. Schatz: And it takes this really loaded thing that people freak out about – this idea of privilege – and it disarms it by being funny. I will say that one of my favorites is the radical activists coloring page spread, which comes at the end of the section about history. I love the way that page looks, I just think the artist really nailed it. It’s fun. I love thinking about people coloring all these different names – it’s just this huge collage of individuals and groups,and organizations from across the centuries. I love the idea of thinking of someone coloring it in and then being like, “Who is this,” and googling it and learning about someone new. I cling to that kind of historical knowledge so much, especially in times like this because I think knowing that other people have been through this or iterations of this, or way more horrific s**t than this…to study how they did it and to know we’re part of that lineage of resistance is really important. CNN: I was really struck by the “know your lane” exercise. What would you say to someone who was maybe looking to change lanes, so to speak, to participate in or speak on something they aren’t as experienced with or haven’t confronted personally? Is that even possible? Schatz: Well, be sure to use your turn signal and really look over your shoulder as well. (laughs)  Bell: And that’s actually good advice, that’s not strained metaphor.  Schatz: I love nothing more than really squeezing the life out of a metaphor, so I can keep going with this. What I really mean is, look before you merge. If you want to change lanes, that’s great, but understand the lane that you’d like to go into before you go into it. Who’s already there? Who’s coming up behind you? Who’s up ahead? How fast are they going? What kind of cars are in there?  I think anybody can switch lanes and move into another kind of space of activism, but you’ve gotta know who’s already there and who’s been doing the work before you figure out where you fit in. Bell: For me, [I’d say] two things. One, yes of course you can change your lane, but don’t bulls**t yourself into thinking you’ve changed your lane if you didn’t. In the wake of 2020, there were many responses from White people about racism, and some of those people thought they changed their lanes and were bulls**tting. All those people thought with one Instagram black square that…who knows, but I think they thought they’re now in the anti-racist lane and they weren’t. They just were not.  And two is what Kate said. This anti-racism lane has been going for a long time. So if you wanna get into a new lane – and this could be anything in your life – that lane’s already going, so actually pay attention and study up before you get into that lane, so you can know, “I’m not good enough to go in the fast lane of that lane. I should sit on the sidelines and pay attention before I get in there.” CNN: You’ve both talked about parenting, and while so much this book is for adults, there are some really memorable spots where you talk directly to the adults about how to talk to children about anti-racism – a concept that is increasingly among the most politically divisive topics in our society. Why do you think classrooms have become ground zero for the battle over who gets to control history?  Schatz: It’s ground zero and it always has been, right? This is not a new thing. We’ve seen it for years, history textbooks getting re-written, edited, changed and controlled. It’s also how most Americans learn history, in the classroom – America considers history to be a subject in school, not an active part of our lives and existence. It’s a thing we learn in school that maybe you got a good grade in, but you probably didn’t.  And because of that, what happens in the classroom – unless you come from a family or a community that is really enthusiastic about history – really shapes most people’s sense of what this country is and how we got here. And it’s being taught in radically different ways all over this country. Bell: You don’t empower teachers to do their jobs by taking things away from them. And so if a teacher realizes, “I can’t say these words” or “I can’t talk about this book,” you’re not gonna get the teacher at their most powerful. But you’re not gonna stop teachers, either. You know what I mean? We understand that teachers are part of the revolution and we want to give them better tools.  Schatz: And, I would add that the other key component here of the revolution and change-making is, in addition to teachers, the young people. To them this is so uncool. Banning books is so uncool. Teenagers know that. Like, this is not a good look. (laughs) ‘Cause guess who knows how to get information? Kids and teenagers. They all know how to go on the internet. They all know how to access information and that’s actually where a lot of them get radicalized by White supremacists. So the more that we are taking books out of schools and the more that we are limiting what teachers can teach and what kids can learn, the more that they’re gonna be turning to the vast dark web to get information.  CNN: There’s a part in the book – under the heading of “We #@%*!’d up!” – where you both talk about a moment when you got it wrong and apologized. Can you say more about why you included those stories?  Schatz: Because it’s really important for us to be transparent. I think we’re very clear in the book that we are not experts. We’re also not perfect. We’re not outside of this thing that we’re talking about, right? When we say everyone’s gonna f*** up at some point, we literally mean everyone, including ourselves. That felt like a no-brainer, sharing these stories. As we’ve talked with people who’ve read the book, it’s really one of the things that clearly resonates with a lot with people. I’m glad we made that choice. I also think it models to the reader how we can be honest and vulnerable.   Bell: For me, if I don’t show vulnerability, then I’m a really poor example. ‘Cause as much as people may think I am him sometimes, I am not Cornel West. Like, I have not done all the reading, I have not studied all the things, I have not been to all the protests. So, I’m very aware that the more that I’m showing that I don’t always have the answer, the more you go, “Oh, I don’t always have the answer either.” And so, I think being vulnerable and apologizing, and being very clear about your apology, and loud about it is important. The example I wrote about in the book, we literally talked about it live on television when I had messed up.   Schatz: I was thinking about it recently, there’s that great example from a few weeks ago when Lizzo changed her song lyrics and did that great public statement. What a great example, I would’ve put that in our book. But there you go. That’s how it works. She said, “Hey, everybody. I had this song, there was a word in it. People let me know that it was offensive. I went in and re-recorded the song, re-released it. I’m sorry, I’ve learned,” like, there you go.  Bell: And I think that, while I’m sure Lizzo got some messages that were supportive, I’m sure she got some messages that hurt. And I think sometimes when we get caught, we think that if it hurts, then it’s wrong. “You hurt my feelings, so you must be wrong.” Um, not all the time. And sometimes it’s okay to have your feelings hurt.

275,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/rep-peter-meijer-michigan-gop-primary/,"In the final days of Rep. Peter Meijer’s close fight for his party’s nomination, the Michigan Republican and his allies are slamming Democrats for meddling in Tuesday’s GOP primary. An outside group supporting Meijer – one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump – launched a new ad over the weekend criticizing the Democratic establishment for helping the freshman congressman’s Trump-backed opponent.  “Fox News confirms it: Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to elect their hand-picked candidate for Congress in the Republican primary, John Gibbs,” the ad warns. “West Michigan must say no to Nancy Pelosi’s handpicked candidate for Congress.” And in a Monday morning post for the Common Sense Substack, Meijer rails against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as well as some of his Democratic colleagues – including some who sit on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding January 6, 2021 – for defending the House Democrats’ political arm. “The Democrats are justifying this political jiu-jitsu by making the argument that politics is a tough business. I don’t disagree. But that toughness is bound by certain moral limits: Those who participated in the attack on the Capitol, for example, clearly fall outside those limits,” Meijer writes. “But over the course of the midterms, Democrats seem to have forgotten just where those limits lie.” Among the House Democrats Meijer calls out by name are Reps. Jamie Raskin and Elaine Luria, both of whom sit on the select committee. Both members, Meijer writes, have “rationalized” the DCCC’s investment. The pro-Meijer group, Principled Leadership for Michigan, has spent just over $1 million on ads ahead of the high-profile primary contest. Much of the group’s budget appears to come from Meijer family members, according to FEC filings.  Overall, nearly $3 million has been spent on ads in the House primary, with Meijer and Gibbs locked in a close race for the nomination in the Western Michigan seat. Gibbs, a former Trump appointee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has embraced Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The former President endorsed Gibbs but has done relatively little to support his preferred candidate financially. The DCCC, on the other hand, has spent more than $300,000 on ads that lightly criticize Gibbs and highlight his endorsement from Trump. The signal boost for Gibbs is an attempt by Democrats to give the party a more favorable general election matchup.  And it’s just the latest in a string of primaries where Democratic groups have spent millions boosting far-right candidates in competitive GOP primaries. Not all Democrats are thrilled with the strategy. “I believe Democrats should focus on helping Democrats win,” Rebecca Katz, a longtime Democratic strategist who is now advising John Fetterman’s Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, told CNN last week. “In this year of all years, why make that gamble in a Republican primary? It just seems like their priorities are out of whack.” In his Substack post, Meijer writes that the gambit in his district undermines the “moral high ground” Democrats have taken.  “As the January 6 Select Committee continues to warn about the ongoing threat to democracy, their own party dues are paying to help elect the same villains they rail against,” Meijer writes.",John Gibbs;Donald Trump;Elaine Luria;Peter Meijer;Rebecca Katz;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Jamie Raskin,Department Of Housing;John Fetterman Senate;Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee;Cnn;Cnn;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer;Meijer,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,2640;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,805;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,407;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,246;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,550;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,681;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,2261;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1003;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1054;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2160;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,209;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,993;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,563;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,694;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,563;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,694;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,142;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,483;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1024;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1352;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1443;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2459;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2690;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2744;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2778;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,3162;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLARS,514;URBAN,2083;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1137;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1120;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1227;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,106;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,581;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2986;USPEC_POLICY1,496;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,496;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,3257;EXTREMISM,2629;LEADER,284;LEADER,2182;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,284;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2182;ELECTION,2149;ELECTION,2511;WB_699_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT,2095;IMPEACHMENT,267;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,69;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2477;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3275;TAX_FNCACT_APPOINTEE,2046;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,435;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,3244;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,1781;",Pennsylvania;Michigan

104,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/northwest-heat-oregon-deaths/,"The searing heat that has baked the Northwest is suspected to have led to at least 14 deaths in Oregon and eight in Washington state, officials said.  The most recent death in Oregon was reported Saturday.  An “elderly male who died was in his home that had a non-functioning air conditioner,” Clackamas County said in a news release. The medical examiner’s office is investigating the official cause of that death. Other suspected heat-related deaths happened in Multnomah, Clackamas, Umatilla and Marion counties, Oregon State Police spokesperson Mindy McCartt said. The official causes of those deaths are also under investigation, McCartt said. The temperature at Portland International Airport reached or exceeded 95 degrees for “6 straight days, with 3 of those at or just above 100,” the National Weather Service said Saturday.   In Washington, there were seven suspected heat-related deaths since last week, the State Department of Health said in a statement on Tuesday, citing preliminary data. At least three of those deaths occurred in King County, which includes Seattle, between July 26 and 31, the county medical examiner’s office said in a separate news release. During a 7-day period that ended Sunday, emergency rooms treated more than 540 patients with heat-related illnesses, the health department statement added. More than 13 million people across the Northwest were under heat alerts Sunday, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. Major cities impacted include Portland; Seattle; Billings, Montana; and Boise, Idaho. Much of the central and eastern regions of Washington and Oregon remained under excessive heat and red flag warnings Monday evening, according to NWS.  The Oregon Department of Emergency Management tweeted resources to get help, including a map showing cooling centers in the state and details on how to get transportation.   But the heat wave scorching the Northwest will ease up this week.  The most extreme temperatures have shifted away from the coast and into interior portions of the Northwest, Brink said Sunday. “This dome of heat will shift into the northern Plains by Tuesday and into the Midwest by Wednesday,” she said. “And even the Northeast will get into above average temperatures by Thursday and Friday.” CNN’s Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.

114,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/pact-act-burn-pits-legislation-cnntv/,"Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough on Sunday pushed back against Senate Republicans blocking passage of the administration-backed PACT Act, warning that if the chamber passes GOP senators’ proposed amendment to the legislation aimed at providing care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, “we may have to ration care for veterans.” McDonough told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that a proposed amendment from Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey would put “a year-on-year cap” on what the VA can spend to care for veterans suffering from exposure to burn pits and sunsets the fund after 10 years, telling Tapper, “I can’t, in good conscience, do that, because the outcome of that will be rationing of care for vets, which is something I just can’t sign on.” “This has been the No. 1 priority for President Biden,” McDonough said, touting executive action steps the Biden administration has already taken to remove the burden of proof for veterans seeking care for toxic exposure. “I guess what I’d say is, these folks have waited long enough. Let’s just get it done, and also let’s not be for a proposal that places artificial caps on year by year, and then functionally, at the end of those 10 years, makes this fund go away. Let’s not sign up to that, because at the end of the day, the risk of that is going to be rationing of care to veterans.”  On Saturday, McDonough visited people demonstrating at the Capitol in support of the legislation, delivering pizzas to the group, who pledged they would stay overnight. President Joe Biden, who remains in isolation at the White House after testing positive again for Covid-19 on Saturday, told the group via a FaceTime call, “I’ll tell you what, as long as I have a breath in me, I’m going to fight to get this done – as long as I have a breath in me.” Earlier on “State of the Union,” Toomey had defended his decision to lead a group of Republican senators in delaying passage of the bill. The Pennsylvania Republican accused Democrats of attempting to “sneak in something completely unrelated that they know could never pass on its own” while reiterating that he and his fellow Republicans are “not opposed” to the core provisions of the bill.  “[Democrats] know they’ll unleash their allies in the media and maybe a pseudo-celebrity to make up false accusations to try to get us to just swallow what shouldn’t be there,” Toomey said in an apparent reference to comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for victims of toxic burn pit exposure who has been vocal since the procedural vote failed. Stewart, who criticized Toomey last week for voting against the bill, pledged Sunday to join advocates for the legislation camped out on the US Capitol steps and refuse to leave until the Senate approves the bill.  “We will do our best to make sure that justice is done and that these veterans get – not an entitlement – but what they’ve earned and that this country has to live up to,” he told NBC. Toomey’s opposition to the legislation centers on the accounting categorization of certain spending in the bill, which he said would “allow our Democratic colleagues to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending spree.” He said he wants a vote on his amendment to change the spending categorization before he agrees to allow the bill to come to a vote.  “We are spending way too much money to use – to hide behind a veterans bill, the opportunity to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending spree is wrong,” Toomey said. “And we shouldn’t allow it.” When pressed on the text of the legislation that indicates the allocated money has to be spent on health care for veterans who were injured from toxic burn pit exposure, Toomey dismissed that interpretation of the bill.  “This is why they do this sort of thing,” said Toomey, who is not running for reelection this year. “Because it gets very deep in the weeds and very confusing for people very quickly. It’s not really about veteran spending. It’s about what category of government bookkeeping they put the veteran spending in.”  In response to Toomey’s comments, Senate Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, told CNN’s Jim Acosta Sunday evening that Democrats are not pulling “a fast one.” “I don’t agree with his assessment, and I think that veterans who serve this country are pretty important because they fight for our freedoms, and they make sure that we are safe and secure,” Tester said.  “And when it takes time to take care of them, we got to step up and do that. That is the cost of war,” he added. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

620,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/new-york-migrants-buses-texas/,"New York Mayor Eric Adams has claimed that some migrants are being “forced” on buses from Texas, as 14 more asylum seekers arrived in the city Sunday on another bus sent by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.  Fifty-four asylum seekers arrived in New York Friday on board a bus from Texas, according to the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs. Abbott’s office indicated that New York is now a designated “drop-off location for the busing strategy as part of the governor’s response to the Biden administration’s open border policies overwhelming Texas communities,” according to a statement released Friday announcing the arrival of the first bus. “It’s unimaginable, what the governor in Texas has done,” Adams told reporters Sunday. “When you think about this country, a country that has always been open to those who were fleeing persecution and other intolerable conditions, we’ve always welcomed that. And this governor is not doing that in Texas, but we are going to set the right message, the right tone, of being here for these families.” On Monday, Adams called it a “mean and cruel thing.” Abbott claimed in a statement Monday, though, that the asylum seekers freely chose to go to New York, “having signed a voluntary consent waiver, available in multiple languages, upon boarding that they agreed on the destination.” “What’s horrific is the thousands of illegal immigrants overrunning and overwhelming our border communities with populations smaller than a New York City borough, and Mayor Adams is hypocritically upset about welcoming a few dozen into his sanctuary city,” Abbott said. “If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis, he should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border—something the President continues failing to do.”  A fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies, Abbott began sending hundreds of willing migrants on buses to Washington, DC, earlier this year as an affront to the administration. Abbott’s office has said that “to board a bus or flight, a migrant must volunteer to be transported and show documentation from DHS.” More than 5,100 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 135 buses, according to the governor’s office.  “In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,” Abbott said Friday. His state has been busing people to Washington, DC and New York City “to provide relief to our local partners,” Abbott said in the statement. Manuel Castro, commissioner of the mayor’s immigrant affairs office, told CNN New York is a right-to-shelter city, so anyone who needs shelter may receive it. However, the city has “exhausted” its regular shelter space, so it has leased additional space at hotels, he said. “These are families, these are people,” Castro said. “They have a right to be here as asylum-seekers and New York is here to welcome them. They frankly need a lot of support. They’ve traveled a long way to get here.” Adams repeated Monday he hoped to be in touch directly with the White House about federal assistance on the matter.  “Right now, we are at a state where we must get to the assistance from the federal government,” Adams said.  The Biden administration has “been in regular contact with Mayor Adams,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said, and the administration is “committed to working with them as we do effectively with other local leaders through FEMA funding and other support.”  “As we have always said, there is a process in place for managing migration flows, and Republicans governors should stop meddling in that process and using desperate migrants as political tools,” Hasan said.  Some migrants did not want to come to New York, mayor says Around 40 people were expected to arrive Sunday, Adams said, adding that it is not known if others got off the bus before it arrived in New York. Some of the migrants who did arrive Sunday told the mayor they had relatives in other cities and did not plan to come to New York.  Some families “wanted to go to other locations and they were not allowed to do so,” Adams said Sunday. “They were forced on the bus with the understanding that they were going to other locations that they wanted to go to, and when they tried to explain, they were not allowed to do so.” Families whose desired destination was not New York said it took three days to get to the city from Texas, according to Castro, who also met with them, noting many “were hungry and thirsty, with small children.”  Adams issued an emergency declaration last week to “rapidly procure shelter and other services” for people seeking asylum in the city. Those who want to stay in New York will go to shelters, and volunteer groups will be helping “those who want to go somewhere else” to travel to another location, the mayor said. New York Taxi Workers Alliance executive director Bhairavi Desai told CNN they had 19 yellow cabs and Uber cars ready to voluntarily transport refugees arriving from Texas from the bus stop to shelters or to homes of friends or family in the area Sunday morning. “Everyone we saw looked exhausted by the journey. Many people looked relieved to finally reach safety but there were also people crying from the trauma,” Desai said. “It’s wrong, and in our melting pot city, it won’t work,” Desai added. “We wanted to do our part to let new neighbors know that they’re welcome here, and in NYC there are people who will help.”  Around 4,000 asylum seekers have entered the New York City shelter system since late May, according to Adams, who said the influx is the primary driver of around a 10% increase in the city’s Department of Homeless Services’ census. New York’s shelter system is currently receiving more than 100 asylum seekers looking for some form of housing per day, on average, according to the homeless service’s department. CNN has asked the mayor’s office for the total number of migrants the city is processing from Texas. Generally, once migrants are processed by federal authorities and released from custody, they are allowed to move throughout the country while they go through immigration court proceedings. They are often released in Texas and other border states, and then continue on journeys to other parts of the country. An immigration judge will ultimately decide if they are allowed to remain in the US or be deported.

208,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/joe-biden-covid-positive-day-two/,"President Joe Biden is continuing to isolate at the White House on Sunday after testing positive for a rebound case of Covid-19 Saturday morning, White House physician Kevin O’Connor wrote in a letter Sunday that was released by the White House, adding that the President “continues to feel well,” but, “unsurprisingly, his SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing remained positive.”  Biden, who emerged from isolation earlier last week after testing negative on rapid antigen tests starting Tuesday, “will continue to conduct the business of the American people from the Executive Residence,” O’Connor writes, continuing “to be very specifically conscientious to protect any of the Executive Residence, White House, Secret Service, and other staff whose duties require any (albeit socially distanced) proximity to him.” A White House official said Sunday that Biden, 79, had six close contacts prior to the positive test a day earlier that sent him back into isolation. None of those contacts have since tested positive, the official said. Sunday is considered “day one” of positivity in the President’s latest isolation period. When Biden first tested positive on July 21, there were 17 individuals who were considered close contacts. None ended up testing positive. Out of concern over a rebound infection, officials had worked last week to limit Biden’s exposure to others, including making events socially distanced.   In a sign that he’s committed to working despite testing positive again, Biden on Saturday FaceTimed a group of demonstrators protesting on Capitol Hill after Senate Republicans blocked efforts last week to pass legislation aimed at veterans suffering from ailments related to burn pits. During Biden’s first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough, according to his doctor. The President completed a five-day course of Paxlovid, which requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to doctors on May 24 advising that Covid-19 symptoms sometimes come back, and that may just be how the infection plays out in some people, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated or treated with medications such as Paxlovid. The CDC said that most cases of rebound involve mild disease and that there have been no reports of serious illness. Biden is fully vaccinated and received two booster shots. He received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination in March.

92,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/new-york-city-monkeypox-public-health-emergency/,"New York City officials declared monkeypox a public health emergency Saturday, saying the city is the epicenter of the state’s outbreak and the move will boost measures to help slow the spread of the disease. “We estimate that approximately 150,000 New Yorkers may currently be at risk for monkeypox exposure,” Mayor Eric Adams and Dr. Ashwin Vasan, commissioner of the city’s health and mental hygiene department, said in a joint statement. “This outbreak must be met with urgency, action, and resources, both nationally and globally, and this declaration of a public health emergency reflects the seriousness of the moment.”  The declaration takes effect immediately, the statement said. It comes just a day after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued an executive order declaring a state disaster emergency, saying “more than one in four monkeypox cases in this country” are in the state. Among several other actions, the governor’s order expands the number of people eligible to administer monkeypox vaccines, requires providers to send vaccine data to the state’s health department and will boost ongoing response efforts including efforts to get more vaccines and expand testing capacity, the governor’s office said.  What you need to know about monkeypox  Other leaders in the US – and across the globe – have been sounding the alarm over monkeypox as infection numbers continue to rise and vaccine supply is falling short of demand. Experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci have stressed the monkeypox outbreak needs to be taken seriously and handled in a more rigorous manner, while federal officials continue to weigh a nationwide public health emergency declaration.   San Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency on Thursday in an effort to strengthen its preparedness and response amid “rapidly rising cases” and high demand for the vaccine, the city said. The declaration goes into effect on Monday. “We know that this virus impacts everyone equally – but we also know that those in our LGBTQ community are at greater risk right now,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement. “Many people in our LGBTQ community are scared and frustrated. This local emergency will allow us to continue to support our most at-risk, while also better preparing for what’s to come.”   In Washington, the federal government is continuing to monitor the response to monkeypox and will use it to consider whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency, US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday.  “We will weigh any decision on declaring a public health emergency based on the responses we’re seeing throughout the country. Bottom line is, we need to stay ahead of it and be able to end this outbreak,” he said.  Former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned earlier this month it may be too late to contain the outbreak, telling CBS, “The window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed.” Last weekend, the World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern after convening its second emergency committee on the issue.  WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as “an extraordinary event” which constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.”",Eric Adams;Xavier Becerra;Scott Gottlieb;Anthony Fauci;Ashwin Vasan;Kathy Hochul;London Breed,Us Health;York City Department Of Health;Human Services;World Health Organization;Drug Administration,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2516;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2516;TAX_DISEASE_INFECTION,1487;HEALTH_VACCINATION,747;HEALTH_VACCINATION,1205;HEALTH_VACCINATION,1522;HEALTH_VACCINATION,2009;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,747;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,1205;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,1522;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,2009;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,747;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,1205;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,1522;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,2009;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,747;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1205;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1522;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,2009;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,205;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,3546;WB_1406_DISEASES,205;WB_1406_DISEASES,3546;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,205;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,3546;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2671;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,937;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,69;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,579;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1775;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2651;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2788;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,3270;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,3396;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,69;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,579;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1775;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1886;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2651;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2788;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,3270;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,3396;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,1388;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1091;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1359;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,59;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,569;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1765;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2641;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2778;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,3260;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,3386;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,3481;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,59;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,569;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1765;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2641;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2778;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3260;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3386;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3481;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,69;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,579;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,980;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1775;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1886;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2360;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2651;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2788;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3270;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3332;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3396;ECON_DEVELOPMENTORGS_WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION,3212;TAX_AIDGROUPS_WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION,3212;GENERAL_HEALTH,59;GENERAL_HEALTH,381;GENERAL_HEALTH,569;GENERAL_HEALTH,683;GENERAL_HEALTH,1230;GENERAL_HEALTH,1765;GENERAL_HEALTH,1876;GENERAL_HEALTH,2641;GENERAL_HEALTH,2663;GENERAL_HEALTH,2778;GENERAL_HEALTH,3199;GENERAL_HEALTH,3260;GENERAL_HEALTH,3386;GENERAL_HEALTH,3481;MEDICAL,59;MEDICAL,381;MEDICAL,569;MEDICAL,683;MEDICAL,1230;MEDICAL,1765;MEDICAL,1876;MEDICAL,2641;MEDICAL,2663;MEDICAL,2778;MEDICAL,3199;MEDICAL,3260;MEDICAL,3386;MEDICAL,3481;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,286;TAX_FNCACT_FEDERAL_OFFICIALS,1720;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,135;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,452;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1630;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,2625;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,2923;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,3074;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,3244;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,135;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,452;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1630;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2625;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2923;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,3074;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,3244;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,135;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,452;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1630;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2625;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2923;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,3074;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,3244;TAX_FNCACT_COMMISSIONER,362;TAX_FNCACT_COMMISSIONER,2986;GOV_LOCALGOV,24;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3342;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,2958;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,2958;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,2958;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2958;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2958;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,2958;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,3295;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,3421;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,43;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,300;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,739;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1008;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1159;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1474;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1621;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2567;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,3235;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,113;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,639;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,24;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1720;LEADER,317;LEADER,2245;TAX_FNCACT_MAYOR,317;TAX_FNCACT_MAYOR,2245;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,500;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2690;",San Francisco;Washington;New York
7,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/us/kentucky-man-rescues-children-teachers-from-floods/,"Nathan Day was up early Thursday morning helping his son get ready for work when he received a message from a neighbor asking him to save her grandchildren from the rising floodwaters.  Day, a former coal miner who lives in Hindman, Knott County, said he was unaware of what was happening in the region until he received the message saying the children needed help getting out of their house. “I didn’t know what they was talking about, then I went outside,” Day told CNN. “You heard a lot of people screaming and begging for anyone to help.” That day, Eastern Kentucky saw flooding that officials have called unprecedented, with entire houses and bridges swept away and communities isolated because of flooded roads. At least 35 people have died in the flooding, and many who survived lost everything they had. Hundreds of people are still missing.   Day and his wife, Krystal, had no boat, so they waded through the water to help save the five children and two mothers who were stuck on the roof of their home. “At 3 o’clock in the morning, I was in that water with my wife. I put a child under each arm and one around my neck and took them back to my house. The oldest child was holding a small dog,” Day said. After Day and his wife rescued the children and the two women, he set his sights on rescuing his former high school English teacher, Ella Prater, and his second grade teacher, Irma Gayheart, who both lived nearby. “I just kept pacing back and forth because I saw the water rising and I knew my two former teachers were probably trapped in their houses,” Day said. “It was heartbreaking.” He then enlisted the help of three other neighbors to help check on his teachers, who both live alone, according to Day. When they saw Prater, Day said they held her “by both side of her arms and never looked back. We said, ‘We have to go.’” It took Gayheart a few minutes to answer the door, but when she did, she told him she was okay, but had been sitting on her kitchen counter top watching the water rise.   “I wasn’t going to leave her there because she’s a special lady to me. You could tell by looking at her face that she was drained,” Day said. “She spent the night on the kitchen counter top and the water was up by the counter top.” With the help of his neighbors, Day was able to reunite both teachers with their families, who were waiting for any updates about their whereabouts. “These are two of the most special women you’ll meet in your life, and when they show you love, they show you true love. They truly care about everyone that’s around them and that stuck with me my whole life,” Day said when explaining why he risked his life to rescue his teachers. The ordeal has been emotionally draining, but he’s glad the children and former teachers are safe, Day told CNN.

89,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/30/weather/mckinney-wildfire-northern-california/,"A wildfire raging in Northern California was exacerbated by winds from thunderstorms this weekend, causing significant growth, officials said. The fire, known as the McKinney fire, has burned more than 51,000 acres as of Sunday afternoon, according to CAL FIRE. It is 0% contained. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for Siskiyou County, saying the blaze has threatened critical infrastructure and forced nearly 2,000 residents to flee their homes. The McKinney fire started on Friday in Siskiyou County near the California-Oregon border, about four hours north of Sacramento. The Klamath National Forest lists the cause of the fire as under investigation. Siskiyou county has a population of just about 44,000, according to the US Census Bureau. A mandatory evacuation order was announced for parts of Siskiyou County on Saturday, according to the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office. Residents within the evacuation zone are being asked to “please leave immediately.” About 60 people were evacuated from the Pacific Crest Trail on Saturday due to the McKinney Fire, the Jackson County Sheriff’s office in Oregon said on its verified Facebook page, noting the hikers were rescued from the “California side of the Red Buttes Wilderness.” The Pacific Crest Trail runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to Canada, according to the forest service. A red flag warning, which indicates dangerous fire conditions, is in effect in the area through Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service. “Abundant lightning” is expected through Monday, as well as scattered thunderstorms, which “could contribute to fire spread” but could also bring “locally significant wetting rainfall” in some areas, the weather service said. Firefighters were forced to shift their tactics “from an offensive perimeter control effort” to more of a defensive posture to assist with evacuations Saturday morning, an InciWeb report notes.  Two other fires burning in Siskiyou County – the China 2 and Evans fires – merged and together burned more than 300 acres, prompting evacuation warnings for more than 200 residents, according to the governor’s office. The state of emergency is meant to unlock state resources and allow firefighters from other states to help crews battling the fires in California, according to the governor’s office.

558,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/infant-safe-haven-law-abortion-invs/,"As many American women reckon with the sudden loss of their constitutional right to abortion, conservatives have floated an alternative they say makes abortion less necessary: safe haven laws.  The laws, which allow mothers to anonymously abandon infants at hospitals and other designated sites shortly after giving birth, have been in place in all 50 states since 2008. Two conservative Supreme Court justices nodded to safe haven laws during the case that overturned Roe v. Wade. Justice Samuel Alito noted in the majority opinion that Americans who want to restrict abortion point to the laws as an option for women. During oral arguments, Justice Amy Coney Barrett conceded that pregnancy is an infringement on bodily autonomy but distinguished that from concerns over forced parenthood and echoed a sentiment anti-abortion activists have been pushing for decades, asking: “Why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?”   But American women — even in states where in recent years they have had little access to abortion — rarely use safe havens as an option. A CNN review of the laws found that there have been at least 3,251 babies surrendered since 1999. Some states go years without a woman using the option. CNN reached out to social services agencies in all 50 states — 40 states provided figures while seven states told CNN they do not process data on safe haven use, partially because incidents are so rare. Three didn’t provide data. When women don’t have an abortion but opt not to raise the child, they more frequently turn to traditional adoption, which gives biological parents control over the placement of an infant and can allow for a longterm connection with the child through open adoption. Even so, the numbers in the United States are relatively low — in 2020, there were roughly 95,000 children who were adopted. This figure includes children who are adopted by family members and stepparents. Meanwhile, nearly a million American women received abortions in 2020. Northwestern University professor Katie Watson, who teaches law, ethics, and humanities to medical students, said the conservative argument that safe havens are an alternative to abortion is disingenuous. “When a person has an abortion, they are saying, ‘I do not want to have a baby.’ And adoption (or using a safe haven) does mean they don’t have to parent the child, but they still had a baby, which was the thing that most people having an abortion did not want to do,” Watson said.  Safe havens aren’t new  Safe havens were never intended to serve as an alternative to abortion. They were developed to offer an alternative to infanticide, Watson said. Texas passed the nation’s first safe haven law in 1999 after a spike of deserted babies in the Houston area. It allowed a mother or father to surrender their baby at any hospital, fire station or emergency medical services station in Texas. The only condition was that the baby not be more than 30 days old. Today, the law allows up to 60 days.  By 2008, all 50 states had adopted their own safe haven laws. The pace at which the relatively obscure concept gained steam in state legislatures was due to widespread public support on the issue, said Dr. Suzanne B. Haney, who chairs the Council on Child Abuse and Prevention at the American Academy of Pediatrics.  “We’re talking about babies being left in dumpsters. I mean, that’s a really easy bandwagon to get onto,” she said. Carol Sanger, a law professor at Columbia University, agreed with Haney but indicated that some abortion rights activists and legislators worried the laws were a distraction from the larger reproductive rights conversation, but felt they had little choice but to be on board. “If you don’t agree with safe havens, it’s like you can be accused of encouraging infanticide,” Sanger said.   The laws vary by state. In North Dakota, for example, babies under a year old can be abandoned at a designated safe haven site, which includes police stations, hospitals and even county social services offices. In Alabama, parents only have three days and the baby must be taken to a hospital. There’s been a recent push to expand safe haven laws. In March, Virginia lawmakers passed four bills to expand the state’s laws. In early June, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves penned a column for a Christian news website, titled “The New Pro-Life Agenda,” where he promised to “extend safe haven laws.” Last year, legislation expanding safe haven protections passed in Indiana and Pennsylvania.  Perhaps safe havens are doing their job: Incidents of infant homicides have become less frequent. According to a 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that looked at infant homicides and safe haven laws, the overall US infant homicide rate fell by 66.7% from 2008 to 2017 — after all 50 states had safe haven laws on the books. Babies are still 5.4 times more likely to be killed on the day they are born than at any other point in life.  But Watson, the Northwestern professor, said the existence of safe haven laws may not be the only reason why fewer infants are dying by homicide. “Our recognition and treatment of prenatal and perinatal depression — maternal depression — is so much better,” Watson said. “The awareness that pregnancy can mess with your head and your mental health sometimes may contribute to that lower rate of infanticide.” The anti-abortion movement’s ‘prominent’ connection to safe haven laws In the early 1970s, decades before safe haven laws were implemented, Monica Kelsey was abandoned by her biological mother at a hospital on the day she was born. Kelsey, who was adopted by an Ohio family, in 2016 founded Safe Haven Baby Boxes, a nonprofit that has installed more than 100 electronically monitored baby boxes at fire stations and hospitals across seven states. The boxes allow individuals to anonymously deposit unwanted infants. On her personal website, Kelsey advertises herself as “a pro-life advocate and speaker” but, in an interview, she emphasized that her organization depended on workers and volunteers from both sides of the debate. She noted that baby boxes are aimed at helping women who’ve already given birth.  “These babies — they’re (already) born,” Kelsey said. “This isn’t a pro-life or pro-choice issue that we’re working with.” Kelsey’s position — having one foot in the anti-abortion fight and another in the safe haven movement — isn’t unique. The efforts have long been intertwined. They share much of the same religious rhetoric and influence. The first safe haven law in Texas was called the ‘Baby Moses’ Law, named for the Biblical story of Moses’ rescue. In Missouri, parents can drop a child at a crisis pregnancy center, which are often faith-based organizations that aim to dissuade women from getting an abortion and are exempt from regulatory oversight that govern health care facilities, in addition to a hospital or a fire station. In some states, such as Arizona and New Hampshire, a parent can surrender a baby at a church, despite the fact that they lack medical resources. Religious groups such as the Catholic Church promote safe haven laws on their websites. “Choose Life” license plates in states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Washington, DC, help finance safe havens.   To those paying attention, Coney Barrett’s line of questioning on safe haven laws during the oral arguments in the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case may have sounded familiar. She pushed the lawyer representing Jackson Women’s Health to separate parenthood from pregnancy — a common narrative from anti-abortion groups, according to Watson — and framed the choice as one between undergoing an abortion at fetal viability, or 23 weeks, or waiting to “terminate parental rights at the conclusion.”  The language was remarkably similar to an amicus brief filed more than a year earlier by The Justice Foundation, an influential conservative legal non-profit, on behalf of 336,214 signers of a “Moral Outcry” petition. The Texas-based foundation argued that safe haven laws eliminate any legal need for abortion, in one instance contending that, under the 15-week Mississippi law, a woman could “simply wait a relatively short while later and place the child with the state after birth at no cost whatsoever.” The brief’s conclusion was even more explicit: “The Safe Haven laws give women total freedom from burdens of unwanted children.”  But experts say Coney Barrett’s comments from the bench ignore the dangers of childbirth — American women are 14 times more likely to die from childbirth than they are from a legal abortion, according to a 2012 study — and the months-long physical and financial demands of pregnancy. Lawyer Julie Rikelman, who represented the Mississippi clinic in the Supreme Court Case, highlighted these issues in her response to Coney Barrett. “Pregnancy itself is unique. It imposes unique physical demands and risks on women and, in fact, has impact on all of their lives, on their ability to care for other children, other family members, on their ability to work,” she said.  The fixation on safe haven laws by some of the nation’s most prominent anti-abortion legal scholars punctuated their decades-long collaboration with safe haven activists, said Laury Oaks, a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of a book on safe haven laws and reproductive justice. The anti-abortion movement’s connection to safe haven laws is “so prominent,” Oaks said. “Amy Coney Barrett very publicly connected the dots.” What does a post-Roe America mean for safe havens? Maybe not much Safe havens are unlikely to see a meaningful surge in popularity in a post-Roe America, according to Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University, who has written about safe haven laws. Without the protection Roe v. Wade provided, women will face more challenges in obtaining abortions: They will have less time to make a decision, and it may be more difficult to get one. This could mean women will seek out more dangerous options, including some self-induced abortion methods. “Changing the rules on abortion does not really change whether people want an abortion or even whether they’re able to get it, but it changes how it happens,” Grossman said. For those women who want an abortion and are unable to obtain one, even legally, they typically won’t turn to safe havens or adoption. Most women will probably choose to raise the babies themselves, according to data from the Turnaway Study, which was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, and examined the effects of unwanted pregnancy on nearly 1,000 women’s lives over the course of five years. The study revealed that for women who sought an abortion but were denied one, just 9% decided to put the baby up for adoption.   The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices touched on the study in their dissenting opinion and on the conservative majority’s focus on safe haven laws.  “The majority briefly notes the growing prevalence of safe haven laws and demand for adoption,” wrote Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. “The reality is that few women denied an abortion will choose adoption. The vast majority will continue, just as in Roe and Casey’s time, to shoulder the costs of childrearing.” Several experts told CNN that activists and governments should instead focus on how to prevent babies from being deposited at safe haven sites to begin with.  Oaks, the author of a book on safe haven laws, talked about the need for more awareness around existing social welfare programs so women can raise babies themselves. Haney, who works at the American Academy of Pediatrics, argued for, among other things, better paid parental leave and robust mental health support for new mothers. Sanger, the Columbia law school professor, said the United States needs to provide women with more options — including early access to abortion — before they feel the only choice is to abandon their baby.  “I don’t think that safe havens should be celebrated,” Sanger said.

377,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/nancy-pelosi-visit-taipei-taiwan-trip/,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan despite China’s threats of retaliation over the visit.  Pelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan.  Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said in a statement on Tuesday that the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.” “Our discussions with Taiwan leadership will focus on reaffirming our support for our partner and on promoting our shared interests, including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the statement said. “America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.” China responded by announcing military exercises and with bellicose rhetoric warning that the speaker’s visit “has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and seriously infringes upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” “It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces for ‘Taiwan independence,’ ” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. “China firmly opposes and sternly condemns this, and has made serious démarche and strong protest to the United States.” China’s military said it was on “high alert” and would conduct exercises around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s trip, saying in statements it was launching a series “targeted military operations to counteract the situation.”  Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said that 21 Chinese warplanes made incursions into its air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Tuesday. In response, the Taiwanese military issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor the activities, it added. China frequently sends warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ. The highest number of incursions ever recorded was on October 4 last year, when 56 military planes flew into the area on the same day. An ADIZ is unilaterally imposed and distinct from sovereign airspace, which is defined under international law as extending 12 nautical miles from a territory’s shoreline. US ambassador summoned China’s anger was underlined when Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xie Feng summoned the US Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, late on Tuesday evening local time to protest the visit, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported on Wednesday. Xie accused Pelosi of “deliberately provoking and playing with fire against people’s will,” saying her visit is “extremely egregious” and the consequences will be “extremely serious.” “Anyone who attempts to manipulate the Taiwan issue to gain political gain … will eventually be nailed to the pillar of shame in history,” Xie said, according to the state media report. Taiwan’s foreign ministry welcomed Pelosi on Tuesday evening. “It is believed that the visit of Speaker Pelosi and other heavyweight members of Congress will strengthen the close and friendly relationship between Taiwan and the United States and further deepen cooperation between the two sides in various fields globally,” the ministry said in a statement. Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je also embraced Pelosi’s visit but cautioned that the self-governing island should avoid being put “between a rock and hard place” in US-China relations. “Taiwan should keep its own agency.  We are friends with the US and Japan, and we don’t have to be on bad terms with China,” Ko said in a statement. “Taiwan is in between the US and China. We should keep an open communication channel with China and the US to effectively avoid crises.” Pelosi to meet with Taiwan’s president Wednesday The House speaker is expected to visit Taiwan’s presidential office and parliament on Wednesday morning (local time), a senior Taiwanese official told CNN. She will first visit the parliament before heading to the presidential office for a meeting with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, the official said. Pelosi is expected to depart Taiwan later on Wednesday, according to a news release issued by the foreign ministry. The official was not authorized to speak about Pelosi’s travel plans that have not been publicized.  Pelosi is traveling with House Foreign Affairs Chairman Gregory Meeks of New York, Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Mark Takano of California and Reps. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois and Andy Kim of New Jersey.   The American Institute in Taiwan said Pelosi’s delegation will meet with senior Taiwanese leaders “to discuss US-Taiwan relations, peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights, democratic governance, and other significant issues of mutual interest.” Pelosi wrote an op-ed that published in The Washington Post after she landed Tuesday, arguing that her trip demonstrated the US commitment to Taiwan under threat from China. “In the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s accelerating aggression, our congressional delegation’s visit should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom,” the California Democrat wrote. Pelosi’s stop in Taiwan was not listed on the itinerary of her congressional visit to Asia, but the stop had been discussed for weeks in the lead up to her trip. The potential stop prompted warnings from China as well as the Biden administration, which has briefed the speaker about the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory.  The White House said Tuesday that Pelosi’s trip was consistent with US policy on Taiwan, and that the US would be watching China’s actions closely after Pelosi leaves. “Obviously, we’re going to be watching this closely. There is no reason for this visit to become a spurring event for a crisis or a conflict or for a pretext that the Chinese might try to whip up for some sort of military action,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said on CNN’s “At this Hour with Kate Bolduan” on Tuesday. “Of course, we’re concerned about that, which is why part and parcel of her trip is to reaffirm the United States commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan with its self-defense,” Kirby added. “Again, there’s no reason for this to erupt in to conflict. There’s no change to our policy. This is absolutely consistent with it. And we’re just going to watch as things unfold.” Bipartisan praise A group of more than two dozen Senate Republicans, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, issued a statement supporting Pelosi’s congressional delegation, which was all Democrats, landing in Taiwan. “We support Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan,” the Republicans said. “For decades, members of the United States Congress, including previous Speakers of the House, have travelled to Taiwan. This travel is consistent with the United States’ One China policy to which we are committed. We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.” McConnell praised Pelosi’s arrival in Taiwan, saying Tuesday that he believes “she has every right to go.” “It’s been unseemly and counterproductive for President Biden and his aides to have publicly sought to deter her from doing so,” the Kentucky Republican said. “I welcome the speaker’s display of support for Taiwan’s democracy, but I hope she returns from Asia more mindful of the military dimensions of the Chinese threat, and more committed to working with Republican to address the changing balance of military power out in the region.” US President Joe Biden said publicly before Pelosi’s travel that the US military did not believe it was a good time for Pelosi to visit Taiwan, but he stopped short of telling her directly not to go, two sources previously told CNN. Biden did not speak to Pelosi before her trip, Kirby said Tuesday.  The issue of Taiwan remains among the most contentious in US-China relations. Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, discussed it at length during a phone call last week that lasted more than two hours.   Administration officials are concerned that Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.  While Biden has not endorsed Pelosi’s visit, US officials believe Chinese leadership may be conflating the House speaker’s trip with an official administration visit, and they’re concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden, much, if at all, since both are Democrats.  Pelosi has long been a China hawk in Congress. She’s previously met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. She also helped display a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square two years after the 1989 massacre, and in recent years she’s voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

517,https://us.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/albuquerque-4th-victim-was-at-funerals/,"When Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain looked outside his home, he used to see a safe, idyllic neighborhood. Now he’s haunted by the spot where his brother was ambushed and killed.  “I see from the window, this is the place where my brother died,” said Hussain, who lived in the same Albuquerque apartment complex as his brother Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.  “I’m scared to go outside of my apartment,” the grieving brother said. “I’m scared to sit on my balcony.” For Muslims in New Mexico, everyday life is now permeated by fear after four Muslim men — including Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – were gunned down in Albuquerque. Three of the victims – Hussain, 27; Aftab Hussein, 41, and Mohammad Ahmadi, 62 – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” said Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division. The fourth victim – 25-year-old Naeem Hussain – was found dead Friday night by Albuquerque police. He became the third Muslim man killed in the city within two weeks and the fourth since November. Hours before his death, Naeem Hussain – who just became a US citizen – attended a funeral for two of the other shooting victims. The young man expressed concern about the recent shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico. While no suspect information has been released, Albuquerque police say the killings of the four men from South Asia “may be connected.” Hussain said whoever killed his brother didn’t just steal the life of a beloved family member; they also ripped away his family’s sense of freedom. “My kids do not allow me even to step out of my apartment. They say, ‘Dad, it’s scary,’” Hussain said just steps from where his brother was gunned down. “We planted some flowers in our yard, and we haven’t even watered them. They said, ‘No, somebody might be hiding over there.’” Hussain had the grim task of identifying his brother’s remains at the medical examiner’s office. He said his brother’s body was mutilated so badly, it was clear the killing was deliberate.  “More than half of his head is gone. … At the time that I saw the body, he didn’t even have half of the face,” Hussain said.  “This is not a random killing. This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.” Reward money increases, but so does the anxiety The grief and terror have spread to Muslims across New Mexico, said Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico. “Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Assed said.  “Businesses are closing … early. Students won’t leave their homes,” he said. “It’s affecting people from coming over to the mosque to conduct their services, their prayers.” Police are seeking “a vehicle of interest” that might be connected to the four killings. They tweeted a photo of the car, a dark gray or silver Volkswagen with four doors and tinted windows. Police said it might be a Volkswagen Jetta. Anyone with information about the car or about the killings is asked to call the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or contact Crime Stoppers at 505-843-STOP or CrimeStoppersNM.com.  “All information you provide will be anonymous and confidential,” the city of Albuquerque said. “There is a $20,000 reward from Crime Stoppers and a $10,000 reward from Council on American-Islamic Relations for information that leads to an arrest.” Hussain said his family is fearful of going out with a killer or killers on the loose. But he said he’s speaking out to try to stop the violence. “I am raising voice for my brother because I do not want any other’s brother to become victim of those shooters, any sister to become victim of those shooters, any mom or dad to become victim of shooter,” Hussain said.  He said he hopes “other people do not become victim of those shooters and suffer like I’m suffering.” ‘They are afraid to go to school’ While police have not called the four killings hate crimes, “in my opinion, clearly it is hate-driven,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Monday. “They are obviously targeting Muslim men, and they are happening right here in our own refugee community,” Keller told CNN. “We know that folks in our community, in the Muslim community especially, they are afraid to even leave their house, especially at night. They are afraid to pray. They are afraid to go to school,” the mayor said.  Albuquerque is not just “in a place of grieving right now, but also at a place of outrage,” Keller said. But the community is determined to help.  “We have marshaled every resource to have now police presence at all our mosques during prayer time,” the mayor said. “We are even doing meal deliveries for families that are afraid to leave their house to get food.” Assed, the mosque president, said he’s now among the many Muslims in New Mexico grappling with fear every day. “I get in the car, and I’m watching every which way possible. I’m watching my side mirror. I’m looking in the back. I’m looking out for any sign of anything out of the ordinary,” he said. “At the end of the day, we don’t have an alternative.”  A new US citizen who fled religious persecution is killed in America Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had become a US citizen just last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami. “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” said Shahalami. “He was very hardworking. He shared whatever he made with his family back home.” The young man, who opened his own trucking business this year, had plans to bring his wife over from Pakistan and buy some property in Virginia, Shahalami said. “He had a lot of dreams, and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.” The day he was killed, Hussain attended a funeral for two other Muslim men who were recently killed in the city, said Tahir Gauba, director of public affairs with the Islamic Center of New Mexico. Hussain went to a lunch at the mosque after the funerals and approached Gauba to ask if he had more information on the shootings, Gauba told CNN. “He stopped by to say ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ He was worried. I told him to be careful,” Gauba said. “We thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear. … It’s driving everybody crazy.” Two other Muslim men killed – Muhammed Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein – were members of the same mosque. Both were from Pakistan and were killed in southeast Albuquerque just days apart, police said. After their killings, police began investigating whether the November 7 slaying of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan, was connected. ‘The fear is so strong’ The Islamic Center of New Mexico is painfully familiar with violence against Muslims in the community.  An arsonist started a fire on the center’s property in November, the city of Albuquerque’s website said. A month later, police arrested someone on suspicion of arson and negligent arson. Fortunately, no one was in the mosque at the time of the fire, Assed said. But now the center, where about 700 to 800 Muslims gather on Fridays, is warning residents to be cautious. “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” the center posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” After Hussain’s killing Friday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced she will send additional state police to Albuquerque. The city is also increasing police presence at mosques, Muslim-affiliated schools and the University of New Mexico, officials announced. “We have heard from the community that the fear is so strong, there is a concern about even things like groceries and getting meals for certain folks in certain areas of town,” Keller said in a weekend briefing, adding the city is helping with providing meals for those affected by the killings. Albuquerque has always felt like a welcoming community for Muslims, even after 9/11, Gauba said. “This is the first time we are feeling this kind of atmosphere,” he said. “We are in fear.” CNN’s Raja Razek contributed to this report.

Police posted the unidentified man’s photo on Facebook last week, asking the public to contact them with any information on his identity. And users were quick to respond with comments on the suspect’s resemblance to the “A Star is Born” actor. “Well, this is easy. Bradley Cooper. There ya go,” one comment reads.

361,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/california-mckinney-fire-tuesday/,"As a massive wildfire continues to cut a path of destruction through a Northern California forest, residents are left to contend with lost homes and treasured family items. The McKinney Fire, the largest in California so far this year, broke out Friday afternoon in the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border and exploded in size, quickly scorching more than 55,000 acres and forcing thousands to flee, not knowing if their homes will still be there when they return. The fire had zero containment as of Monday. Four people have died as a result of the fire, according to the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office. Two were found dead Sunday inside a vehicle burned in a driveway in the fire’s path near State Route 96, and two were found dead Monday in separate residences along that same route on the fire’s perimeter, the sheriff’s office said. Video from State Route 96, along the Klamath River, shows trees burned black, charred vehicles on the side of the road with wheels melted off and destroyed structures, including the Klamath River Community Hall. Resident Mike Nowdesha surveyed the rubble Monday where his home once stood, a house he and his wife recently renovated. “My wife and I have been married, in August, 51 years. So our whole life was right here,” Nowdesha told CNN affiliate KDRV. He gestured towards the charred remains, pointing to where their pantry, kitchen and dining room used to be.  Nowdesha said there was no home insurance his family could afford, “so it’s basically a total loss.” “If we can start over, we’ll make do,” he said. It’s still unclear how many homes have been lost to the McKinney Fire. Multiple communities remain under evacuation orders or warnings as the fast-moving fire spreads, burning through dry vegetation and in lands that haven’t burned in recorded history.  “In the first hours, we know we lost numerous structures in and around the community of Klamath River. We know that many homes burned to the ground, a tragic loss that compounds the loss of homes and property in catastrophic fires over the past few years,” Klamath National Forest Supervisor Rachel Smith wrote on Facebook. Search and rescue crews fanned out Monday, going through about 100 structures, including homes and sheds, in the burn area, Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue said during a community briefing. In the meantime, hundreds of firefighters continue to battle the blaze while contending with above-normal temperatures and low humidity levels. The early stages of the firefight were complicated by dry lightning strikes in the forest. “Mother Nature wasn’t very kind to us when this fire started,” Cal Fire Unified Incident Commander Darryl Laws said in the community briefing Monday. Fire officials believed there were enough resources to battle the blaze when it started Friday, but things quickly changed, Laws said.  “Thunder cell came over the top of it and our dreams were shattered,” Laws said. “It went to 18,000 acres immediately, in probably a very short time – a few hours – and it turned 180 degrees, and ran right at the community Klamath River.” By Monday, there were more than 1,300 firefighters battling the blaze from multiple agencies. Conditions improved Monday, with rain falling over a large swath of the McKinney Fire overnight and slowing the fire’s spread. However, there were numerous lightning strikes over the past two days and several other fires have been reported in the Klamath National Forest, according to the US Forest Service. “While last night’s weather mitigated fire spread, vegetation in the area is extremely dry and the continued threat of thunderstorms and the associated strong, erratic winds could result in increased fire behavior,” fire officials said in a Monday update on InciWeb, a US clearinghouse for fire information. A red flag warning for dangerous fire conditions was extended into Tuesday for “abundant” lightning hitting dry vegetation in the forest, officials said. California’s unrelenting drought has set the stage for explosive fire spread throughout the state. As crews worked to protect structures along the fire’s perimeter, some residents who had been evacuated were allowed to return to their homes Monday to survey the damage. Resident Kyle Lowe returned to the Klamath River home where generations of his family had been raised to find it destroyed. Only the fireplace and chimney were left standing. “My grandfather raised his children here,” Lowe told KDRV, pointing to the charred debris where the home used to be.  It’s unclear what sparked the destructive McKinney Fire. “Though the cause is still under investigation, it is clear this fire was not caused by lightning. A USFS specialized regional team is currently in place investigating the fire’s cause and will be actively working to identify what was responsible,” Smith, the forest supervisor, said. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for Siskiyou County, a move that officials said will help unlock state resources and allow firefighters from other states to help crews battling the fires in California.

Ten years ago, my friend Patrice and his wife, Brigitte, installed air conditioning in their summer home in the Pyrenees mountains in southwestern France. Their son insisted and paid for it – a good thing. It’s been getting hotter every year there, and this year the temperatures hit 95 degrees Fahrenheit and stayed there as forest fires spread across the country. In Paris, though, where temperatures broke 100 degrees several days this summer, my friends have never installed it. Their house is on a landmarked street. The bureaucratic hurdles would have been insurmountable. And now it’s less likely than ever that they’ll have a chance. France has never embraced air conditioning with any eagerness. Now, along with Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland, indeed most of the European Union, all are facing a toxic confluence of high temperatures, higher prices for energy and a Russian threat to cut off gas supplies. Now, all are putting increasing pressure on their citizens to hold down consumption. And the efforts are getting broader, deeper and will be immediately visible to everyone – visitor and citizen alike. Each nation and a host of European companies should also be serving as a role model for the world’s second-biggest environmental miscreant – the United States. France’s minister for ecological transition, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, issued an edict last week that shop owners who keep their street doors open with the air conditioning at full blast will be liable to pay fines of 750 euros ($765). She was, of course, quite right when she explained that this practice was “absurd” and led to 20% “more energy consumption,” according to The Guardian. The government may also have found a steady new revenue source. Walking through neighborhoods in some parts of Paris, there’s door after door open, each with a huge exhaust vent hose from the portable air conditioner snaking out to the sidewalk – not to mention the department stores with their doors flung wide, cold air blowing into the superheated streets. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, the largest glacier in the southern Alps, atop Mont Blanc, has lost half its mass – “a giant on borrowed time,” Le Monde headlined on its front page Saturday. Combined with forest fires that have incinerated large stretches of Europe, reportedly almost four times the 15-year average, environmental panic is all around. So in France, the government is going to demand concrete measures. Between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., there’ll be no outdoor illuminated advertising – violators risk a fine of about 1,530 euros ($1,562). During those same overnight hours, no inside temperature can be above 66 degrees in winter or below 79 degrees in the summer. In parking garages, there can be no lights at all, except when a car or a person arrives or departs. Indeed, the government is already preparing sweeping “load-shedding” plans for the winter ahead as are a host of major corporations. Carrefour, the giant chain of 1,700 supermarkets, plans to start roasting its chickens an hour earlier at 7 a.m. to smooth demands on the electric grid, according to the Financial Times. As it happens, France is the best positioned of most countries in Europe to cope with the carbon crisis. Energy has long been cheap in France – far cheaper than in the United States – largely a tribute to the proliferation of nuclear-generating plants, where it gets most of its electricity. And French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans earlier this year to build up to 14 new nuclear reactors.  Our monthly electric bills in our Paris studio apartment average 36 euros ($37) a month year-round, including electric heat during the winter. We bought a small portable air conditioner a couple of years ago, but we’re the only Americans in our 1870s-vintage apartment building, so the only ones with any air conditioning at all. The French government’s Agency for Environment and Energy Control estimates that lowering a home thermostat by 1 degree during the winter can save 7% on heating bills.  Italy is also preparing emergency plans that includes turning off lights that illuminate monuments, closing commercial buildings at 7 p.m. and implementing maximum cooling levels in summer and minimal heating in winter in all public buildings except hospitals. But with Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s recent resignation and the government in chaos, one can only hope these measures will kick in. It may be less of a problem in Spain, where Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez actually doffed his necktie and urged everyone to go tieless to cut back on air conditioning. The biggest problems are in regions staring down the twin problem of high energy use and deep dependance on natural gas from Russia. There, in some respects fear of a winter ahead with dwindling energy supplies seems to be trumping fear of damage wrought by excessive carbon use this summer. A dozen EU countries are especially affected by their reliance on gas supplies from Russia, exceeding even the European average of 40% dependency, and which explains at least some of their efforts at conservation. Germany is going beyond most of its neighbors to break the addiction to Russian gas. The city of Hanover is turning off all hot water, even for showers, in every public building, the BBC reports, while there’ll be no heat at all in such buildings from April through September. Berlin reportedly may even turn off nonessential traffic lights at night.  Germany moved to its second level of a three-stage emergency gas plan in June, proposing four floating liquefied natural gas import terminals and two permanent offshore sites, with two online by the end of this year, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Meanwhile, France is planning to restart its coal-fired power plant in Saint-Avold in the coal region of Moselle in the eastern part of the country, according to Le Monde. Shuttered in March, it’s now slated to reopen October 31. “It always comes down to the same thing, which is saying that you don’t want to cut your energy, but you also want to end polluting activities,” Le Monde quoted Macron as saying on July 14 while repeating his pledge to close all the nation’s coal-fired plants. France also reportedly wants to build a floating LNG terminal in its northern port of Le Havre and two massive floating wind farms off its Mediterranean coast.   The entirety of the 27-member European Union, except Hungary, has ratified a 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter – voluntary for the moment, but if Russia follows through on suggestions it might shut down all gas supplies, could become mandatory. In short, Russia is effectively forcing its biggest customer – the EU – to undertake dramatic reforms immediately that threaten to alter the need for its principal export permanently. The question, of course, is how much support for these kinds of measures there will be when the weather, especially across northern Europe, pivots sharply later this fall and into a brutal winter when there is simply not enough gas, especially from Russia, to go around. How long that game of chicken can go on may be the biggest question facing both ends of the gas supply lines. It is essential, on so many levels, for these nations to stand firm against Russian aggression and its attempts to manipulate global markets to its own benefit.",Mario Draghi;Mont Blanc,New York Times;Agency For Environment;European Union;European Union;Carrefour;Cnn;Cnn;Deadline Club Award;United States;United States,"UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,769;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2731;LEADER,3939;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_FRENCH,127;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_FRENCH,3929;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_FRENCH,4368;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,6;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,508;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1118;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1905;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2334;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2458;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4203;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4336;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5067;",Russian;Italy;Germany;Le Havre;Paris;France;Americans;United States;Berlin;Russia;New York;Hanover;Greece;French;Poland;Spain;Hungary
28,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/iranian-journalist-masih-alinejad-man-arrested-ak-47/,"Iranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad on Monday told the Iranian regime, “Go to hell,” just days after authorities informed her a man armed with an AK-47-style rifle was arrested in the Brooklyn neighborhood where she lives with her family, including her stepchildren. Authorities are investigating whether the man in custody was there to harm her, a law enforcement official told CNN. Alinejad was targeted in an alleged kidnapping plot by Iranian nationals last year after she spoke out against the Islamic republic. The plot was organized by an Iranian intelligence official, an indictment alleged, but Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied any involvement, calling the accusation “baseless and ridiculous,” according to semiofficial Iranian state media. In a CNN interview, she said the Iranian government had been targeting her and her family for her efforts to give voice to those being oppressed in the country where she was born. “I’m not scared (for) my life at all because I know what I’m doing. I have only one life, and I dedicated my life to give voice to Iranian people inside Iran who bravely go to the streets – face guns and bullets to protest against Iranian regime – but this is happening in America,” she said. Dictators are joining forces, sharing playbooks, she said, and if democratic countries don’t do the same, more Americans will be targeted. Toward the end of the televised interview, she asked if she could speak directly to the Iranian regime. Facing the camera, her curly hair uncovered and decorated with a flower, she  said, “Go to hell. I’m not scared of you. I have only one life. You care about power. I care about my dignity and freedom like millions of other people inside Iran. I’m not scared of you. You can kill me, but you cannot kill the idea. The idea is just fighting for freedom, dignity.” Alinejad, a US citizen, then urged President Joe Biden to expel Iranian diplomats in the country. “The Iranian regime twice challenged the US government on US soil. I deserve to have freedom in the United States of America. Kick them out. If you don’t, believe me, they’re going to come after more American citizens,” she said. FBI informs of her of man with rifle Alinejad was home Thursday when federal agents informed her about the armed person in her Brooklyn neighborhood, she said. “I was told by the FBI to stay away from your home,” Alinejad told CNN on Sunday. “I was shocked. I couldn’t even believe it. I was telling myself, ‘If I opened the door, what was I going to do?’ “ Officers with the New York Police Department arrested Khalid Mehdiyev on Thursday as he drove away from the Brooklyn neighborhood after he failed to stop at a stop sign, according to a federal criminal complaint. NYPD officers found he was driving without a license because it had been suspended, the complaint says. Police later found in the back seat of his vehicle a suitcase containing a “Norinco AK-47-style assault rifle … loaded with a round in the chamber and a magazine attached, along with a separate second magazine, and a total of approximately 66 rounds of ammunition,” the complaint says. Officers also found $1,100 in $100 bills, the complaint says. He is charged with possessing a firearm with an “obliterated” serial number, the complaint says. Mehdiyev is set to be back in court August 12. His attorney, Stephanie Marie Carvlin, told CNN the defense has no comment at this stage in the case. Law enforcement officials saw Mehdiyev, a Yonkers resident, in the Brooklyn neighborhood on two occasions last week and also discovered he had been issued a parking ticket in the same neighborhood the week before, on July 23, according to the complaint. On Thursday morning, Mehdiyev drove a gray Subaru Forester SUV and stayed in the area for several hours where he “behaved suspiciously,” the complaint states. On one occasion, Mehdiyev got in and out of his car several times, ordered food delivery to his car and approached a home in the neighborhood – where Alinejad resides – peering inside the windows and trying to open the front door, the complaint says. Following his arrest, police also recovered two license plates with different numbers and from different states than the Illinois tag on the Subaru, the complaint says. Mehdiyev, according to the complaint, told authorities his rent in Yonkers was too high, and he was visiting Brooklyn to find an apartment. The cash was for a hotel room, and he approached the home in the Brooklyn neighborhood because he intended to ask if the owners might rent him a room, before changing his mind, the complaint says he told investigators. The Subaru was borrowed, and he did not know the suitcase – which he said was not his – contained a rifle, he initially told investigators, according to the complaint. The suspect later told agents “the AK-47 was his, and that he had been in Brooklyn because he was looking for someone,” before invoking his right to counsel, the complaint says. ‘My stepchildren live in the same house’ Alinejad was on a Zoom call with the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, Garry Kasparov, and Venezuelan politician and opposition leader Leopoldo López when she found out about the armed person, she said. The trio was discussing how they can unite, as the Russian, Venezuelan and Iranian “dictators” are doing, she said Monday. “I’m glad my friend @AlinejadMasih is healthy and safe and that the police acted capably against what might have been a deadly situation,” Kasparov tweeted from his verified account Sunday. Alinejad shared a security video on Twitter showing the man she says federal agents told her was the same man arrested by police Thursday. “These are the scary scenes capturing a man who tried to enter my house in New York with a loaded gun to kill me,” she tweeted, though no gun can be seen in the image. “Last year the FBI stopped the Islamic Republic from kidnapping me. My crime is giving voice to voiceless people. The US administration must be tough on terror.” She keeps watching the video, thinking, “Wow,” she told CNN on Monday. “My stepchildren live in the same house, and just imagine if the guy had opened fire. Who knows how many of my neighbors would’ve been killed? My beautiful and supportive neighbors,” she said. Alinejad has spoken monthly with federal agents since the alleged kidnapping attempt last year, she said. “I really thought that the plot was over. I thought, ‘OK, I can focus on my job’ – which I am going to do. Nothing is going to stop me,” she said. “I see this as the continuation of trying to keep Iranian women down.” A voice for the ‘voiceless’ Alinejad, who frequently shares photos and videos of what she calls “voiceless” Iranian women through her social media accounts, says Iranian officials recently warned her about her activism. A spokesperson for Iran’s Headquarters for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice announced in July anyone who sends videos to Alinejad regarding the hijab or commits other anti-government activities is subject to a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Alinejad said the Iranian government has also forced women to publicly denounce her for her work. “I don’t have any weapon. My weapon is this. My weapon is my mobile, and I have photos on my Instagram and my social media, I publish the videos of Iranian mothers. The Iranian regime killed their sons. I just give them voice. I give voice to these women,” she said. The regime has jailed her brother, brought her sister onto TV to disown her and interrogated her mother “for hours and hours” to punish her, she said. “I don’t have any enemy. I’m not a criminal so, of course, this is the Iranian regime,” she told CNN. “When the US government does not take strong action, of course, they feel more powerful to continue this. I see this as a pattern, a continuation of oppressing women, oppressing dissidents outside Iran.” CNN’s Liam Reilly, Brianna Keilar and John Avlon contributed to this report.

43,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/democrats-question-biden-2024-bid/,"Amid an action-packed election night in five states, comments from a debate for a congressional primary set to take place later this month still managed to send shockwaves through the Democratic Party. During a debate in New York’s 12th Congressional District, Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler – who are facing off against one another in the August 23 primary following redistricting – were asked whether President Joe Biden should run again in 2024.  Maloney said, “I don’t believe he’s running for reelection,” while Nadler responded that it’s “too early to say” and that it “doesn’t serve the purpose of the Democratic Party” to deal with the question until after midterm elections. (In a follow-up Wednesday morning, Maloney told CNN of Biden: “If he decides to run, I’m supporting him.”) These comments are significant for several reasons.  1) Even as his job approval rating has dipped below 40%, Biden and his team have repeatedly made clear he plans to run for reelection. “The President intends to run in 2024,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week. 2) These weren’t back-bench members of Congress questioning their party’s leader. Maloney and Nadler both have served in the House for three decades and currently chair powerful committees.  3) They are far from the only elected Democratic officials who have publicly signaled they aren’t ready to get fully on board with a Biden 2024 bid just yet in recent days.  In fact, two Minnesota Democrats went even further on the question. In a local radio interview last week, Rep. Dean Phillips, who represents the Democratic-leaning 3rd District, said that he doesn’t think Biden should run for another term. “I think the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up,” Phillips said. Rep. Angie Craig, who faces a tough reelection bid in the state’s 2nd District, agreed with her colleague. “I would say we need new leaders in Washington up and down the ballot in the Democratic Party,” Craig told MinnPost when asked if she would support Biden if he ran again.  And in the Senate, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has danced around the question. When asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday whether he thought Biden deserves another term, Manchin said: “I’m not getting involved in any election right now. 2022, 2024, I’m not speculating on it.” The tune of some of these Democrats could change if/when a Biden 2024 campaign formally becomes a reality, which wouldn’t happen until after the midterms. But that these Democrats feel they can speak publicly in this manner underscores the perilous position the President finds himself in. According to the latest CNN polling, just 38% of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing, while 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they want the party to nominate someone else in 2024.  It also puts even more pressure on Biden to turn things around – and fast. There are some signs of progress on Capitol Hill, with Congress sending bills aimed at boosting semiconductor production and expanding health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits to Biden’s desk.  And a major part of Biden’s policy agenda, a climate and health care bill, was unexpectedly brought back to life by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Manchin. Getting that legislation over the finish line could help the President begin to put some of the party’s concerns to rest.  The Point: Until Biden is able to rack up a string of political victories, he will continue to face questions from his own party about his 2024 standing.

42,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/new-york-city-mayor-police-recidivists-bail-reform/,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams and police officials on Wednesday released data showing that the number of people arrested three or more times a year for crimes such as robbery, burglary and grand larceny increased significantly during the first six months of 2022.  Adams, a moderate Democrat and former police officer, has made calls for a change in bail laws to give judges discretion to consider a defendant’s “dangerousness” to the community a key part of efforts to combat rising crime in the city.  In New York, unlike every other state, judges can’t consider the harm a defendant may pose to others in setting bail.  Adams and NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said judges should be able to consider public safety and be allowed to remand defendants at their arraignments “based on the severity of their alleged crimes or their history of recidivism.” Adams on Wednesday insisted the release of the new data on recidivism and its role in the city’s crime wave was not an attack on bail reform but a rather window into what he called a “revolving door of justice.” “As a result of this insane broken system, our recidivism rates have skyrocketed and those who say the predicted wave of recidivism wouldn’t happen, and the studies that claim to show the rate of arrest for violent felonies has not changed since the reforms were passed, I have one word for you – wrong. You are wrong,” Adams told reporters at a news conference with NYPD brass.   Adams and police officials said 211 defendants were arrested at least three times for burglary through June of this year – a 142.5% increase compared with 87 people in the first six months of 2017. For shoplifting, 899 people were arrested three times through June – a jump of 88.9% over the 476 defendants in the same period in 2017.  Adams and police officials said nearly 25% of people arrested for burglary committed another felony within 60 days, compared with 8% in 2017. Data for grand larceny and grand larceny auto showed nearly identical increases for 2021, compared with 2017, city officials said.  Officials said the city’s “worst-of-the-worst recidivists” include an offender with 101 career arrests – 88 of them since 2020; another defendant out on parole after 57 arrests since 2020, including 23 for burglary; an offender now out on the street despite 63 arrests, including 13 for grand larceny auto and 39 arrests since 2020.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Thursday that she and the mayor are cooperating on many levels but pointed to some bail changes that are “still not doing the job.” “Some of the bail changes done in 2018, reformed again in 2020, were still not doing the job, that I needed to be done here, and that is to protect New Yorkers,” Hochul said. It takes time to change a culture and a system since the legislature isn’t back and in effect until January, Hochul added. Hochul, who was asked Thursday about the mayor’s remarks, also agreed with the mayor that people who were arrested on gun crimes should not have been let out of jail. The governor said she wants New York to be a state that doesn’t just slow down an increase in crime, but sees an overall decline. “That, to me, is success, when we start reducing the incidents of gun violence,” she said. In a statement, the Legal Aid Society accused the Adams administration of cherry-picking “a handful of cases to misguide New Yorkers and convince them that bail reform is responsible for all of society’s ills.” The non-profit public defender organization urged the state legislature to reject calls for a “dangerousness” provision to the bail statute. “Short of a crystal ball, no judge - or human being for that matter - can predict future behavior,” the statement said.  “Condemning more New Yorkers to languish at Rikers Island – a facility mired in crises perpetuated by this Administration’s inability and refusal to meaningfully act – is not the answer, and we caution the public from falling prey to this endless fear mongering, devoid of facts and ungrounded in reality,” the Legal Aid Society said, referring to the city’s troubled jail complex.  Marie VanNostrand, an analyst with Luminosity, which studies criminal justice data, said she had not seen the city’s data but the mayor’s suggestion that a small number of people were being arrested, released and then rearrested for serious crimes is consistent with other data on the subject.  “The number of people being arrested now who have pending cases – which is what the mayor is referencing – has in fact increased. Now, the causes of that aren’t necessarily clear,” she said. “The mayor made some reference to bail reform … We also know that cases are going on longer because of the pandemic court closures and those types of things. So there’s certainly potentially competing causal factors.” Still, VanNostrand said violent crime and gun violence are increasing across the country, including in states that have not implemented bail reform.  New York state passed bail reform legislation in 2019, making “release before trial automatic for most people accused of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies,” according to the Vera Institute of Justice. Three months after the law went into effect, it was amended to allow judges to institute cash bail in more situations.

73,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/kansas-ballot-abortion-amendment/,"In the leadup to Kansas’ monumental vote on abortion rights, volunteers and community organizers knocked on more than 60,000 doors, and made more than 600,000 phone calls. The goal, according to Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, the coalition opposing the amendment: to engage voters in the Sunflower State across the political spectrum, including rural voters, registered Republican voters who turn out in primaries and the large swath of unaffiliated voters who typically sit out primaries. It worked. CNN projected Tuesday night that voters had decided to reject a proposed amendment and maintain the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution. By Wednesday morning, the numbers were clear: Even as votes were still being counted, nearly 59% of Kansans voted “no” on the amendment – keeping the status quo in the state, where abortion is currently legal up to 22 weeks. And the turnout was tremendous, with more than 900,000 votes counted on the amendment as of Wednesday afternoon. (By comparison, less than 750,000 votes had been counted for the gubernatorial race.)  “Kansans turned out in historic numbers for a primary election to reject this change to our state constitution. They did this because we found common ground among diverse voting blocks and mobilized people across the political spectrum to vote no,” Rachel Sweet, KCF’s campaign manager, said during a media call on Wednesday. Nearly all of Kansas’ 105 counties had some local organization or local leader coordinating outreach, according to Ashley All, the communications director for KCF. The coalition had more than $6.5 million to fund its campaign opposing the amendment. Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University, called the margin a “shock.”   “Nobody in Kansas, from political strategists to pundits to analysts, predicted that kind of margin,” he told CNN.  The result was surprising for a few reasons, he said: Polling ahead of Tuesday showed the “yes” votes ahead, primaries are traditionally low turnout, and Kansas almost always elects Republicans in statewide contests. Christopher Emily, 27, was among those voted against the amendment. “I just think health care is a fundamental right,” he told CNN. “It’s something that needs to happen if the situation calls for it.” How the abortion question ended up on the ballot The amendment that appeared on Tuesday’s ballot was years in the making. In 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the right to an abortion was protected under the state constitution’s Bill of Rights.  In response, the constitutional amendment was drafted by the Value Them Both coalition, a group of organizations that included the Kansas Family Voice and Kansans for Life, which has been “working to push back and correct what our court has done,” Brittany Jones, the policy director of Kansas Family Voice, told CNN. A Senate resolution that sought to place the amendment on the ballot was first introduced in the state legislature in 2020, but it didn’t receive enough votes for final passage. The resolution was reintroduced last year and was approved by a necessary two-thirds majority of the GOP-controlled legislature in February 2021.  The issue then was placed on this year’s primary ballot, rather than the general election, which abortion rights advocates argued was done intentionally by state Republicans to limit turnout. But the stakes were raised when, in June, the US Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, ending the federal right to an abortion, in a case that involved a restrictive Mississippi abortion law.  Advocates in Kansas said that the state constitution was the only thing protecting abortion access with Roe overturned. After the US Supreme Court’s decision, KCF said they saw an increase in volunteer energy and fundraising.  The Value Them Both coalition, which proposed the amendment, blamed Tuesday’s outcome on an “onslaught of misinformation from radical left organizations that spent millions of out-of-state dollars to spread lies” about the constitutional amendment.  “Sadly, the mainstream media propelled the left’s false narrative, contributing to the confusion that misled Kansans about the amendment,” the Value Them Both coalition said in a statement. Still, voters explained to CNN why they voted for the amendment – thus backing Value Them Both’s cause. “I don’t think it’s confusing at all. It gives the legislature the ability to pass laws about abortion. It’s pretty straight cut to me,” Drew Sanlin, an early voter who backed the amendment, told CNN.  “It’s really hard, because I know there are women who feel differently, and it’s hard to be on the other side of them,” said Susan Peterson, 60, who voted “yes” on the amendment.  She told CNN that it’s “important to at least set some limits” on abortion, adding that, “If it’s going to happen, let’s do it within reason.” What happens next For now, abortion is currently legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas, and the state is likely to continue being a haven for women seeking the procedure from nearby states that have rolled back abortion rights. The Value Them Both coalition called Tuesday’s outcome a “temporary setback” and said their “dedicated fight to value women and babies is far from over.” “As our state becomes a abortion destination, it will be even more important for Kansans to support our pregnancy resource centers, post-abortive ministries, and other organizations that provide supportive care to women facing unexpected pregnancies,” the coalition said in a statement. “We will be back.” Despite celebrating the win Tuesday, KCF said Wednesday that the fight to protect abortion access in the state continues. Ashley All, the communications director for KCF, said the “biggest concern” she has now is over Republicans’ two-thirds majority in the legislature that could chose to pass another amendment related to abortion onto the ballot. She stressed that it will be important to protect Kansas’ Supreme Court justices who are up for retention votes this year, arguing that several anti-abortion groups will try to target the court as a result of Tuesday’s vote. All added that she has “no doubt that there will be additional bills that will be put forward in the spring to limit access in other ways,” adding that lawmakers “have not been deterred in the past, and I don’t think that will change.”  “I think that we will still have to have conversations with voters about this issue. We will continue to have to raise the alarm when bad bills are put forward,” she said.",Brittany Jones;Bob Beatty;Rachel Sweet;Susan Peterson;Christopher Emily,Washburn University;Us Supreme Court;Us Supreme Court;Kansas Supreme Court;Kansa Supreme Court;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;A Senate,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2266;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3557;RURAL,365;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,6142;WB_840_JUSTICE,6142;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,15;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1079;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1175;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1971;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,2233;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,2634;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,2885;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,3038;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,3798;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,5127;EXTREMISM,4136;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLARS,4192;TAX_FNCACT_VOLUNTEER,3979;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,261;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1826;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,1679;TAX_FNCACT_BABIES,5395;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,2388;TAX_FNCACT_VOLUNTEERS,90;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSA,42;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSA,1623;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSA,6119;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,5525;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,2023;ALLIANCE,252;ALLIANCE,1780;ALLIANCE,2833;ALLIANCE,4033;ALLIANCE,4413;ALLIANCE,5299;ALLIANCE,5676;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,1548;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,1757;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3028;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,5881;EDUCATION,1886;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,1886;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,338;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1490;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1868;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1988;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1570;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,4274;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1570;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,4274;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1570;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,4274;LEADER,6447;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,6447;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,6447;CONSTITUTIONAL,228;CONSTITUTIONAL,2778;CONSTITUTIONAL,4232;VETO,2346;USPEC_POLICY1,3019;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3019;ELECTION,294;ELECTION,372;ELECTION,403;ELECTION,470;ELECTION,556;ELECTION,4451;ELECTION,6584;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1146;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1242;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,6526;GENERAL_HEALTH,2383;MEDICAL,2383;MEDIA_MSM,4274;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,4786;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,5187;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,5386;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,5630;LEG_CONSTITUTIONALAMENDMENT,2788;LEG_CONSTITUTIONALAMENDMENT,4242;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,396;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5944;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,396;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5944;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1909;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,5916;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4945;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5488;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,6102;TAX_FNCACT_ORGANIZERS,113;SCIENCE,1876;LEGISLATION,3777;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3777;RATIFY,4487;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,1952;WB_695_POVERTY,1952;",Mississippi;Kansas;Washburn University
167,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/americas/puerto-rico-wanda-vazquez-governor-arrested/,"Former Puerto Rico governor Wanda Vázquez was arrested Thursday in San Juan on bribery charges connected to the financing of her 2020 campaign, the US Justice Department says.  Vázquez is the first former governor to face federal charges. And the political scandal is the latest to shake an island still recovering nearly five years after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria.  One of her attorneys, Peter John Porrata, told CNN Vazquez will plead not guilty to the charges. She was released on bond after a brief hearing Thursday.  “I am innocent and a great injustice has been committed, ” Vázquez told reporters after her release. “I have committed no crime.” A onetime political consultant for Vázquez and the president of an international bank have pleaded guilty to participating in the bribery scheme, according to a DOJ statement. A former FBI agent and the owner of the international bank that operated in San Juan also participated in the alleged scheme, federal officials say.  From December 2019 through June 2020, the 62-year-old former governor allegedly conspired in a scheme to finance her gubernatorial campaign, according to the DOJ.  Vázquez allegedly received more than $300,000 from two businessmen to finance political consultants during her campaign, Stephen Muldrow, US Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico, told reporters Thursday.  Vazquez and others are charged with conspiracy, federal programs bribery and honest services wire fraud.  The ex-governor, who is named in three of seven counts in an indictment, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.  “The alleged bribery scheme rose to the highest levels of the Puerto Rican government, threatening public trust in our electoral processes and institutions of governance,” Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. said in a statement.  The bribes were allegedly paid in exchange for Vázquez making an appointment to the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions that benefited businessmen involved in the scheme, Muldrow said. The indictment alleged the owner of the international bank and his consultant – the former FBI agent – agreed to provide funding for Vázquez’s campaign in exchange for her replacing the island’s top bank regulator with one of their choosing. At the time, the bank was the “subject of an examination” by the regulatory agency, federal prosecutors say.  Muldrow said the island’s current governor, who defeated Vázquez in an election, was not involved in the scheme.  A former Secretary of Justice, Vázquez served as governor of the US territory from 2019 to 2021. Her appointment came after disgraced former governor Ricardo Rosselló was forced to step down following islandwide protests against his government.  She became Secretary of Justice in January 2017 – with a mandate that included fighting corruption on the island – and was an ally of Rosselló.  In 2018, Vazquez came under fire for allegedly intervening on behalf of her daughter in a case stemming from a home theft. She faced charges of violating government ethics laws. But a judge later ruled there was insufficient evidence to arrest her. Arrest affects ‘the confidence of our people’  Vázquez’s brief tenure as governor was contentious. Her ties to the disgraced former governor brought scrutiny. Critics accused her of failing to open investigations against members of her own party, particularly Rosselló and his administration’s handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. In January 2020, Puerto Ricans poured onto the streets of San Juan calling for her resignation after Hurricane Maria supplies were found in a warehouse in the city of Ponce, more than two years after the storm.   Later that year, Puerto Rican officials confirmed Vásquez was being investigated for suspicion of mishandling resources meant to mitigate earthquake damage on the island.  Mayra Velez Serrano, a professor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, said Thursday that many people on the island were shocked at the arrest but not entirely surprised.  “That the former Justice Secretary …  and ex-governor, who is married to a judge, that she was involved in anything like this and that she was arrested is still shocking,” Velez said. “This continues to undermine the public’s confidence in the political system and their politicians and the two main parties.” Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, who was elected governor after defeating Vásquez in a primary election, said Thursday, “Under my administration there is zero tolerance for corruption.”  “Today we see once again that no one is above the law in Puerto Rico,” Pierluisi, a member of the same pro-commonwealth party as Vásquez, said in Spanish via Twitter.  The arrest “certainly affects and lacerates the confidence of our people,” the governor said.   “I reiterate that in my administration we will continue to have a common front with the federal authorities against anyone who commits an improper act,” said the governor.  “Wherever it comes from and whoever it may implicate, as well as promoting initiatives and following up on the bills that I have presented to combat corruption,” he said.  In 2019, Rosselló handpicked Pierluisi as his successor.  His short-lived tenure came to an end after just five days when Puerto Rico’s Supreme Court declared his governorship unconstitutional.  Vázquez was subsequently sworn in. “In light of the decision by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, I must step aside and support the Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico,” Pierluisi had said in a statement at the time. Pierluisi then won the election for the seat in November 2020.",Peter John Porrata;Stephen Muldrow;Mayra Velez Serrano;Pedro Pierluisi;Ricardo Rossell,Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;University Of Puerto Rico At Rio Piedras;Twitter;Puerto Rico Supreme Court;Puerto Rico Supreme Court;Cnn;Cnn;Us Justice Department,"TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,1824;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,3132;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,3132;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,3132;WB_2089_ETHICS_AND_CODES_OF_CONDUCT,3132;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,3757;SCANDAL,278;ARMEDCONFLICT,5402;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIANS,4602;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,403;ARREST,65;ARREST,4476;SOC_GENERALCRIME,65;SOC_GENERALCRIME,4476;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,65;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,4476;APPOINTMENT,1969;APPOINTMENT,2680;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,2408;TAX_FNCACT_COMMISSIONER,2003;TAX_FNCACT_BUSINESSMEN,1288;TAX_FNCACT_BUSINESSMEN,2056;CORRUPTION,97;CORRUPTION,813;CORRUPTION,1506;CORRUPTION,1664;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,97;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,813;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,1506;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,1664;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,97;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,813;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1506;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1664;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,97;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,813;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1506;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1664;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,97;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,813;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1506;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1664;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,97;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,813;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,1506;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,1664;NATURAL_DISASTER_EARTHQUAKE,3916;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,736;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,736;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SERRANO,3960;WB_135_TRANSPORT,3714;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,3714;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,3714;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,3427;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,3427;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,3427;TAKE_OFFICE,5655;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,4976;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,4976;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3887;TRIAL,253;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2437;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1729;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2816;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3125;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1729;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2816;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3125;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,375;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,3549;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,3673;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,375;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3549;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3673;MEDIA_MSM,624;MEDIA_MSM,1422;EDUCATION,3974;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,3974;WB_840_JUSTICE,167;WB_840_JUSTICE,2595;WB_840_JUSTICE,2851;WB_840_JUSTICE,4351;WB_840_JUSTICE,5769;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,270;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,691;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1309;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,3987;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,4575;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_WANDA,38;RESIGNATION,3657;LEADER,32;LEADER,229;LEADER,1080;LEADER,2485;LEADER,2630;LEADER,2717;LEADER,3294;LEADER,3355;LEADER,4686;LEADER,5076;LEADER,5254;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,32;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,229;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1080;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,2485;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,2630;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,2717;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,3294;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,3355;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,4686;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,5076;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,5254;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,3148;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,4406;CONSTITUTIONAL,4204;CONSTITUTIONAL,4294;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,5191;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,5191;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,669;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,1628;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1628;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1628;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1628;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1628;TAX_FNCACT_FEDERAL_OFFICIALS,1009;TAX_FNCACT_CONSULTANT,702;TAX_FNCACT_CONSULTANT,2173;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1373;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1833;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATOR,2307;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,4013;TAX_FNCACT_AGENT,885;TAX_FNCACT_AGENT,2194;MEDIA_SOCIAL,4988;SCIENCE,3995;LEGISLATION,3137;ELECTION,2529;ELECTION,4738;ELECTION,5867;EPU_POLICY_LAW,4869;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1009;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3801;TAX_FNCACT_CONSULTANTS,1321;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2584;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2840;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,4361;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,5758;",Puerto Rican;Puerto Ricans;Spanish;Puerto Rico

603,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/impeachment-10-midterms/,"Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state managed to do something that’s proven to be quite rare for the small band of House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump last year: he kept his political future alive.  Over the weekend, CNN projected that Newhouse would emerge out of the top-two primary in the state’s 4th Congressional District along with Democrat Doug White. That makes Newhouse just the second member of the “Impeachment 10” to make it to the general election.  Newhouse’s fellow Washington Republican and impeachment backer, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, conceded in her bid for reelection on Tuesday evening, although CNN has not projected the second place finisher in the 3rd District after already projecting the top spot for a Democrat.  Just one other primary battle remains for the 10 House Republicans who supported the second impeachment of Trump – and have subsequently been a constant target of his wrath. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack that led to Trump’s impeachment, is on the ballot next Tuesday. Ahead of that election, let’s take a look how the members of the “Impeachment 10” have fared this midterm cycle. Two won * Newhouse advanced to the November ballot following last Tuesday’s primary despite facing a Trump-backed challenger, Loren Culp. Washington’s 4th District, which Newhouse has represented since 2015, is a safe Republican seat. * Rep. David Valadao of California is the only House Republican impeachment backer who ran for reelection who did not face a Trump-backed primary challenger. Like Newhouse, Valadao benefitted from California’s top two-primary system, as he narrowly edged out Republican Chris Mathys, who ran as a Trump supporter, for the second spot on the general election ballot in the state’s battleground 22nd District. Valadao also received a valuable endorsement from his district neighbor, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Three lost * Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan lost his primary last Tuesday to John Gibbs, who has Trump’s endorsement. House Democrats’ campaign arm caused an uproar by boosting Gibbs, an election denier, in the Republican primary in hopes of making the state’s 3rd District an easier target in the fall. * Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina was handily defeated by the Trump-backed state Rep. Russell Fry in the state’s 7th District in June.  * Herrera Beutler conceded in Washington’s 3rd District on Tuesday, where she trails Trump-backed Joe Kent, a retired special forces officer, by about 900 votes. CNN already projected Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez would claim the first spot on the general election ballot, but has not yet made a projection for the second spot.  Four are retiring * Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan decided this past spring against seeking a 19th term in Congress. He would have been forced to run in a newly drawn district against the Trump-backed Rep. Bill Huizenga, who ended up being unopposed in last week’s primary.   * Rep. John Katko of New York announced at the beginning of the year that he would retire from the state’s 24th District at the end of the term. New York’s congressional primaries, the first to take place under a new map, are scheduled for August 23.  * Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of two Republicans on the January 6 committee, declined last fall to run for reelection in the state’s 16th District, clearing the way for GOP Rep. Darin LaHood, whose district was eliminated following the 2020 Census. Trump later endorsed LaHood.  * Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio was the first of the group to call it quits last September. Trump had initially endorsed a former aide, Max Miller, to unseat Gonzalez. But after redistricting, Miller ended up running in (and winning) the GOP primary for a different seat.  One is TBD * Cheney faces off against the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman on August 16 for Wyoming’s sole House seat. Despite running in a state that voted overwhelmingly for Trump, she is leaning hard into criticism of the former President. Last week, her campaign launched an ad featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, calling Trump a “coward.” The Point: Regardless of how the rest of the election season plays out, there will be significantly fewer GOP impeachment backers in the House come 2023, meaning Trump’s grip on the conference will be that much firmer.

Abrams paid tribute to the late “Star Trek” actress Nichelle Nichols, who died Saturday at the age of 89. Nichols had played Enterprise crew member Nyota Uhura on the series and multiple “Trek” films.  “I shall have more to say about the trailblazing, incomparable Nichelle Nichols, who shared the bridge with us as Lt. Uhura of the USS Enterprise,” Takei wrote on social media. “For today, my heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend.” Abrams, who directed the 2009 “Star Trek” reboot and 2013’s “Star Trek Into Darkness,” called Nichols “a remarkable woman in a remarkable role.” “A remarkable woman in a remarkable role. Nichelle, you will be deeply missed. Sending much love and respect,” he wrote on Twitter. “Star Trek” star William Shatner also paid tribute, writing, “She was a beautiful woman and played an admirable character that did so much for redefining social issues both here in the US and throughout the world.” Georgia politician and “Trek” fan Stacey Abrams posted a photograph of herself with Nichols, captioning it, “One of my most treasured photos - Godspeed to Nichelle Nichols, champion, warrior and tremendous actor. Her kindness and bravery lit the path for many. May she forever dwell among the stars.” Actor Colman Domingo wrote, “Nichelle Nichols told us that we belonged in outer space. We are limitless. The heavens have gained an Uhura today.” The official NASA Twitter account posted a tribute saying: “We celebrate the life of Nichelle Nichols, Star Trek actor, trailblazer, and role model, who symbolized to so many what was possible. She partnered with us to recruit some of the first women and minority astronauts, and inspired generations to reach for the stars.” Jason Alexander wrote, “My love for the original Star Trek is profound. Nichelle Nichols was a ground-breaker and a glorious ambassador for her show, her role and science all her life. And a truly lovely person. May she have a wonderful adventure to the final frontier.” ",William Shatner;William Shatner;George Takei;George Takei;Colman Domingo;Colman Domingo;Jason Alexander;Jason Alexander;Ripnichelle Uhurapic;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nyota Uhura;Stacey Abrams;Stacey Abrams;William Shatner Williamshatner,Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,2909;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,3174;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,933;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,975;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1119;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1352;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1554;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,1998;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,2186;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,2360;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,2776;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,3041;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,401;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,401;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,401;KILL,102;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,102;MARITIME_INCIDENT,328;MARITIME_INCIDENT,610;MARITIME,328;MARITIME,610;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,328;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,610;RECRUITMENT,2885;RECRUITMENT,3150;SCIENCE,3460;SCIENCE,3701;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,3426;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,3667;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,74;LEADER,1810;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIAN,1810;TAX_FNCACT_ROLE_MODEL,2805;TAX_FNCACT_ROLE_MODEL,3070;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2669;TAX_FNCACT_CREW_MEMBER,173;MEDIA_SOCIAL,401;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,401;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,401;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,401;",Georgia

The 22-month-old’s twin sister survived, along with the two adults who were in the vehicle, Harris County Sheriff’s Office Vehicular Crimes Division Lt. Simon Cheng told CNN affiliate KHOU. “The adults were able to exit the vehicle and rescue the girl – one of the twins – unfortunately the boy twin was not able to be freed from the vehicle being crushed by the cement truck,” he said. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said deputies had responded to a “major crash” at the intersection of Wood Forest and East Sam Houston Parkway on Friday afternoon. He said the truck lost control, “went over the overpass and landed on top of a vehicle with four occupants.”  The driver of the Ford pick-up truck was identified as the twins’ 54-year-old grandmother, while the front seat passenger was their mother, said Cheng.  The two women and the girl were transported to a local hospital in stable condition, according to the sheriff’s office.   The driver of the cement truck sustained possible injuries but refused transport to a hospital, according to Cheng. She “did not show any signs of impairment or intoxication” and there were no signs of speeding, he said. “She is distraught about the incident, and she is cooperating with the investigation.” Cheng said investigations into the crash are continuing. “We do want to conduct a full investigation to see why she lost control or any possible contributing factor on the beltway.” CNN’s Taliah Miller contributed to this report.",Simon Cheng;Taliah Miller;Ed Gonzalez,Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,695;WB_1777_FORESTS,695;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,695;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,695;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1045;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,1308;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1308;WB_1464_HEALTH_OF_THE_DISABLED,1308;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1451;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1553;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1451;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1553;WB_840_JUSTICE,1451;WB_840_JUSTICE,1553;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1451;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1553;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1451;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1553;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1451;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1553;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1451;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1553;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,53;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,553;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,791;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,910;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1181;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,885;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1161;GENERAL_HEALTH,1093;GENERAL_HEALTH,1243;MEDICAL,1093;MEDICAL,1243;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1093;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1243;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1093;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1243;KILL,25;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,25;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,300;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,603;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,1140;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,300;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,603;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1140;WB_1428_INJURY,1209;WB_1406_DISEASES,1209;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1209;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,1209;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1209;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1209;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,166;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1073;",Harris County;Wood Forest;Houston
629,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/kari-lake-arizona-governor/,"Republicans in Arizona have chosen Kari Lake, the former television journalist who has become a leading voice behind former President Donald Trump’s lies about election fraud, as their nominee for governor, CNN projects.  Her victory makes her the fourth Republican who has pushed Trump’s election lies to win a major nomination in Arizona, after CNN’s projections earlier this week for US Senate, secretary of state and attorney general.  Lake, who was endorsed by Trump, will defeat Karrin Taylor Robson, a former member of the state Board of Regents and the establishment GOP favorite, who was supported by outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence.  The race in its closing days turned into a proxy battle in the tug-of-war between Trump and Pence over the direction of the Republican Party, with Trump visiting Arizona to campaign for Lake and a slate of election deniers he had endorsed for statewide office and Pence campaigning alongside Robson.  Lake has made lies about election fraud the centerpiece of her campaign – an approach likely to continue in a November general election matchup against Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state who has defended Arizona’s 2020 presidential results and its largely mail-in voting system.  Hours before polls closed, Lake had already declared to reporters that either she would win or the outcome would be fraudulent.  “If we don’t win, there’s some cheating going on. And we already know that,” she said Tuesday.  In Arizona’s other top races, Blake Masters, the onetime venture capitalist, will secure the Republican nomination for US Senate, while Arizona Republicans have chosen state Rep. Mark Finchem, an election denier, as their nominee to take the helm of the state’s election machinery, CNN projects. And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN also projects. Masters will face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who was unopposed in his primary Tuesday, in what’s expected to be one of the nation’s most competitive, and expensive, midterm match-ups, with control of the 50-50 Senate on the line. Masters was chief operating officer of GOP megadonor Peter Thiel’s investment firm, and his campaign was backed by more than $15 million in spending by Thiel. Masters, who has spread lies about the results of the 2020 election and accused Democrats of trying to “change the demographics” of the country, defeated businessman Jim Lamon and Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, among others, in the GOP primary Tuesday. Finchem is aiming to be the chief elections officer in a state that conducts its voting largely by mail and has been the target of a series of conspiracy theories advanced by Trump and his allies, who falsely allege that the 2020 election was stolen from the former President. The Arizona secretary of state is the state’s second-highest executive elected official and first in line to succeed the governor, as the state does not have a lieutenant governor. Finchem was a member of the far-right “Oath Keepers” in 2014 and was an organizer of the “Stop the Steal” movement spurred by Trump’s lies about election fraud. Finchem has said the state legislature should be able to overturn the will of voters in presidential elections – a position that, if embraced by Republicans after November’s election, could lead to a crisis in the 2024 election in one of the nation’s most competitive battleground states. He’ll face Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, in the fall. This story has been updated with additional information.

265,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/kansas-abortion-midterm-election-what-matters/,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Given the chance to support abortion rights, even in a reliably Republican state in the middle of the country, voters will support abortion rights. That’s the unexpected and consequential lesson from the Kansas primary on Tuesday. CNN’s Greg Krieg called it a “thunderclap” in his analysis. That’s the right word. Lawmakers in Kansas asked voters to change the state constitution, which protects the right to an abortion, and give them permission to pass new laws restricting or banning abortion. The voters resoundingly said no. It was a bipartisan message. The vote was so overwhelming – more than 58% of Kansas primary voters voted to protect abortion rights – that it could not have happened without help from Republicans in the red state. More Republicans voted in the primary than Democrats. See the full results. “We found common ground among diverse voting blocs and mobilized people across the political spectrum to vote no,” said Rachel Sweet, campaign manager with Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which organized against the amendment. One reason the result is surprising. State-by-state polling from PRRI in 2018, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer, suggested Kansas was among the red states and battleground states like Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, where the public was almost evenly split when asked if abortion should be legal in most or all cases. The Kansas primary question was different, about whether lawmakers should have the power to regulate abortion rights. But it was the first time abortion was directly on a US ballot since the Supreme Court stripped women of the federally guaranteed right to obtain an abortion that they had grown accustomed to in the nearly 50 years following Roe V. Wade.  Turnout in Kansas was incredible. It’s August before a midterm election and yet more than twice the usual number of voters showed up.  In fact, turnout – more than 900,000 people took part in the primary – was on the level of recent midterm general elections. It was approaching presidential election levels – 1.2 million Kansans voted in 2016 and 1.3 million voted in 2020.  CNN’s Harry Enten dove into what we know about the turnout data and found that more than 150,000 people likely came out to vote only on the abortion amendment, suggesting it did motivate many voters.  “It’s very clear the abortion amendment drove turnout in Kansas in a way that the political environment without abortion on the ballot has not been able to,” according to Enten. Read his full analysis. The result is a ray of hope for Democrats. They want to use the issue of abortion to drive voters to the polls in November, when control of the House and Senate is on the line. They crowed in statements after the result, and President Joe Biden signed a new executive order on Wednesday meant to safeguard abortion rights – although it will have little or no effect in states moving to curtail or completely cut off access to abortion. Read more about Biden’s order. But abortion is not on most November ballots. The problem may end up being that, unlike in the Kansas primary, a direct question about abortion will not be on every voter’s ballot. “This was actually abortion on the ballot,” said CNN political director David Chalian on “Inside Politics” on Wednesday. “So we have to see if that carries over in the general election context.” But certainly Democrats will try to make this a top issue. “Right now, every Democratic politician on the ballot, their strategists are saying, if you are in a battleground state and you are trying to win back some of those suburban independent voters who were repelled by Donald Trump in ’18 and ‘20, put abortion rights front and center in your campaign.” A key question in key governor’s races. It will also feature in key governor’s races, including in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and especially in Michigan, where the Democratic governor is fighting to keep her job. Governors can provide a bulwark against GOP-dominated legislatures. Activists who support abortion rights in Michigan have submitted signatures to secure space on the November ballot for an amendment to add protection for abortion rights to the state’s constitution and erase a 1931 abortion ban that is currently blocked by a court fight. Where abortion might have less impact as an issue. In the parts of the country like Kansas, where Republicans have majorities in congressional delegations, it’s not at all clear Republicans who support abortion rights will defect to Democrats. In fact, there’s some evidence they will not. CNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy notes the public is clearly opposed to the Supreme Court’s decision – in a Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted July 22-24, a 65% majority said the ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade was a major loss of rights for women in America, with 35% saying it was not.  But she adds that opposition to the decision might not necessarily translate into a vote in November. The same survey finds that Democrats (62%) are less likely than Republicans (74%)  to say they’re certain they’ll vote in the upcoming midterms.  She has also written that while a significant minority of Republicans support abortion rights, polling does not suggest they will shift to support a Democrat based on that issue alone. What more voters are likely to list as a top priority is the economy. And that is a space where Democrats will have to explain why gas prices have taken so long to fall and why inflation continues to drive the costs of everyday goods up for Americans.

355,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/weather/kentucky-flooding-deaths-tuesday/,"Last week’s flooding has killed more than three dozen people in eastern Kentucky, the governor says – and stifling heat will soon compound the challenges for people who are without power and stranded by washed-away roads and bridges. Temperatures in the region Wednesday and Thursday will climb into the 90s, and because of the humidity it will feel close to 100 degrees, CNN meteorologists say. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area from noon Wednesday to 8 p.m. Thursday. “It’s going to get really, really hot, and that is now our new weather challenge,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a news conference Tuesday morning. The flooding, which began early Thursday when heavy rain hit an already saturated region, displaced scores of people from their homes, wiped houses from their foundations, snatched away entire livelihoods including farms and businesses, and left residents with catastrophic damage to their properties, vehicles and other belongings.  At least 37 people have died in the flooding, Beshear said Tuesday. The death toll is expected to go up, the governor said. Beshear for days has said numerous people are unaccounted for, in part because cell phone service was lost – and because the flooding took out rural roads and bridges that are in some cases the only access point for communities in this part of Appalachia.  Finding the missing isn’t the only difficulty. Many people are stranded because of the washed-out roads – and there’s a desperate need to either deliver supplies to them or move them, a resident of flood-hit Knott County says. “I still have aunts and uncles that are stuck in hollers. They are diabetics. They need insulin,” Knott County resident Zack Hall told CNN on Tuesday morning.  “I went to visit one yesterday – was lucky enough to get up there (and deliver supplies) with an ATV. But there was no road … and that’s what people need to understand, is the infrastructure here is just completely destroyed and it makes relief efforts” difficult, Hall said. Though cell service is being restored, some areas are still without it, leaving many unable to contact loved ones or emergency services.  The disaster also knocked out essential power and water utilities, which repair crews have been struggling to restore because of dangerous conditions and washed-out roads. More than 5,600 customers in eastern Kentucky were still without power Tuesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 18,000 service connections were without water Tuesday and an additional 45,600 were under a boil water advisory, Beshear said. The power and water outages are especially troubling for those who are stranded and don’t have easy access to supplies, Hall, the Knott County resident, said. “With the heat, once it dries up for the day, it’s just muggy, humid. … A lot of people on oxygen that don’t have power are already struggling,” Hall said. “I think the worst is still to come if we’re not able to clear paths and get to these people.” More people with utility terrain vehicles are needed to help in the area, he said. “If they can just come and help, help us move things, help us clear paths, help us deliver water, food, medicine to people. (And) pull people out that want to leave the area – we just need as many hands on deck as we can have,” Hall said.   In Fleming-Neon, a city in rural, eastern Kentucky, there’s little left besides debris and mud – and the people who are working to clean up. The City Hall was destroyed and everything inside covered by more than a foot of mud. The town bank, pharmacy and post office were also flooded, which means residents, many of whom are older and still get paychecks and retirement checks through the mail or at the bank, are struggling to access their money and medication, Mayor Susan Polis said.  There is also barely any cell service and the internet is down, making online banking next to impossible.  Access to clean, running water is another major concern. Road problems make it hard to know how many people are missing, governor says The infrastructure challenges make it “incredibly hard to get a good, reliable number on those missing,” Beshear told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday. “The way this water came in … it swept some people miles away from where they were taken, and it’s going to be a process that will take weeks to account for everybody,” Beshear said. More than 1,300 water rescues have been made since the flooding began, Beshear said. Rescuers have been battling the infrastructure difficulties for days as they work to reach trapped residents.  In one stunning video, an 83-year-old woman is seen being airlifted to safety by a Blackhawk helicopter in Breathitt County. A rescue team learned that she and four other family members were trapped in an attic Thursday, Wolfe County Search & Rescue Team spokesperson Drew Stevens told CNN.  The woman was unharmed, Stevens said, but a male family members suffered a broken collar bone and was taken to the hospital. He has since been released.  Some schools destroyed, others damaged Some schools in eastern Kentucky were destroyed and will need to be rebuilt while others are expected to delay the start of their school year because of the damage they sustained, the state’s education department told CNN Tuesday.  “All school districts in the region are assessing damages to buildings and facilities,” Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Toni Tatman said in an email. Tatman expects local schools boards in 11 affected public school districts will modify start days for the upcoming academic year.  Many of the impacted schools were scheduled to welcome students back next week. Now, start dates will likely vary depending on individual districts and schools. As soon “as the immediate needs of food, shelter, and clothing are identified and met and power and water services are restored, districts are beginning to plan their return to school,” Tatman said. Each school district “will create a plan that works best for their students, staff, the facilities available, etc. and virtual instruction may be a resource some districts may choose to use,” the spokesperson added. State grieving after several catastrophes   Flooding is just the most recent disaster to strike Kentucky, which has lost more than 16,000 people to the Covid-19 pandemic and is still recovering from a tornado outbreak that tore through the state in December, killing more than 70 people.  Beshear spoke at an event in western Kentucky on Monday for those impacted by the tornadoes and acknowledged that Kentuckians have been impacted across the state by deadly natural disasters.   “The flooding in eastern Kentucky has been hard, just like these tornadoes,” he said, adding that natural disasters “tear at the fabric of who we are.”    “I was at a breaking point the other night because that happens to all of us – it’s OK not to be OK,” Beshear said. “We’re going to get through it because we have to. We don’t have any other choice.”   The death toll from the flooding spans at least five counties and includes four siblings from Knott county who were swept away by the strong current. The children were identified to CNN by their aunt as siblings Chance, 2; Nevaeh, 4; Riley Jr., 6; and Madison, 8.  “I went to the location of what used to be their home yesterday,” Beshear said of the family that lost the four children. “I stood there in front of what would have been their front door and I saw one of the kid’s swings in the back. I think the oldest one would have been in second grade.

Speaking with Andy Cohen for his SiriusXM show, the “Yellowjackets” actress said Johnny Depp explained homosexuality to her “in the simplest terms” during a phone call when she was filming “Mermaids” with Cher and Depp’s then-girlfriend Winona Ryder.  “There was something going on on set and someone was not being nice to someone else. And they were like, ‘Oh, well, he might be homophobic.’ And then I was like, ‘Well, I don’t understand what that is,’” Ricci recalled in the interview. “And I was in Winona’s trailer and she was like, ‘I don’t know how (to explain).’ So she put me on the phone with Johnny, and Johnny explained it to me.” Ricci said she was 9 years old at the time and that Depp explained the term to her “very matter-of-factly.”    “He was like, ‘It’s when a man wants to have sex with a man and when a woman wants to have sex with a woman,’” Ricci said. “And I was like, ‘Ah, okay,’”  Cohen joked that he didn’t know why Ryder enlisted Depp’s help “when you’ve got Cher in the next trailer.”  Ricci laughed. “I know, we should have run right over there.”  “Yellowjackets” was nominated for seven Emmy Awards last month, including best drama.

417,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/history-refocused/,"These are the surprising and personal stories, lost and hidden in America’s past, hosted by CNN’s Abby Phillip, Suzanne Malveaux, Omar Jimenez, Athena Jones, Ryan Young, John Avlon and more. Knowing these stories might reshape your understanding of the disparities the country faces today.  July 11, 1868 - A former slave claims statewide power during Reconstruction By Channon Hodge, Ken Borland and Frank Fenimore, CNN On April 11, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what would be his last speech from a window at the White House to the crowd below. They had gathered there expecting a celebratory speech on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant just two days earlier.  But that evening, Lincoln’s speech was about Reconstruction, readmitting Louisiana into the Union and a proposal for “giving the benefit of public schools equally to Black and White, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man.” Plantation-owning elites, Southern Democrats and White supremacists, however, would not easily concede political power to those who had so recently been their slaves. That evening among the crowd of listeners was an enraged John Wilkes Booth, who would go on to assassinate the President just three days later at Ford’s Theatre.  For decades after Lincoln’s death, White supremacists would wage a war of intimidation, murder and massacre on anyone, Black or White, who dared covet a share of their power. Yet, Black people persisted.   And between 1865 and 1880, over 1,500 Black men took political office; most not for long, as their efforts were cut down by mobs of violent White men. 1868 Louisiana - African Americans participated in Constitutional Conventions like this across the South where delegates argued over Union demands, drew up new laws and elected new leadership. Oscar James Dunn was one of those determined men. He became the country’s first Black lieutenant governor in Louisiana in 1868 serving under Henry Clay Warmoth on the Republican ticket. Dunn’s first legislative address showed hope and restraint: “As to myself and my people, we are not seeking social equality. That is a thing no law can govern,” said Dunn. “We simply ask to be allowed an equal chance in the race of life.”  Oscar Dunn died mysteriously in office only four years later… The story continues…  1863-1923 - Tulsa was not an isolated incident; The Whitewashing of America By Channon Hodge, Breeanna Hare, Tami Luhby and CNN Staff  As the Civil War neared its end, Union General William Sherman had been convinced that newly emancipated slaves needed their own land to secure their freedom. He issued Special Field Order No. 15, setting aside 400,000 coastal acres of land for Black families and stating that, “…no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside.” A provision was added later for mules. In three months, the potential of Sherman’s order vanished with a single shot. That April, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and in the fall President Andrew Johnson reversed Sherman’s order, allowing Confederate planters to regain the land. It demonstrated a ruthless appropriation that would be repeated for decades to come. Still, Black Americans created pockets of wealth during the Reconstruction years and into the early 20th century. Yet where Black Americans created a refuge, White Americans pushed back through political maneuvering and violence.   “We estimate that there were upwards of 100 massacres that took place between the end of the Civil War and the 1940s,” says William Darity Jr., a Duke University economist who co-authored “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century,” with writer and folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen. “And they take place North and South, East and West.” We looked back through research and news clippings, paying particular attention to around 50 racially charged incidents between 1863 and 1923 when people of color lost property or economic opportunity. The events highlighted here reveal how acts of racial violence of different scope played out across the country and targeted various ethnicities. Historians then helped us examine how and why they had occurred and where we still see the impact today…  The story continues here…  March 1955 - Who gets to represent a movement?  By Brandon Tensley, Skylar Mitchell, Deborah Brunswick, Janelle Gonzalez, Abby Phillip, Jeff Simon and Cassie Spodak, CNN Claudette Colvin did a revolutionary act nearly 10 months before Rosa Parks. In March 1955, the 15-year-old was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a White person on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The teenager and others challenged the law in court. But civil rights leaders, pointing to circumstances in Colvin’s personal life, thought that Parks would be the better representative of the movement. “People said I was crazy,” Colvin recently told CNN’s Abby Phillip. “Because I was 15 years old and defiant and shouting, ‘It’s my constitutional right!’ “  The story continues here…  1968 - 53 years ago a government report about racism shook America By Amir Vera, Bryce Urbany and Cassie Spodak, CNN In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson’s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders – better known as the Kerner Commission – put out a report that attempted to address systemic racism in the US, including police violence against Black people. A Michigan State police officer searches a youth on Detroit’s 12th Street where looting took place in the 1960s. A Michigan State police officer searches a youth on Detroit’s 12th Street where looting took place in the 1960s. The report stated that racism was a major cause of economic and social inequality for Black people and that it was moving the nation toward two societies: “One Black, one White, separate and unequal.” That, coupled with the brutal police treatment of people of color and poverty, helped spark the race riots of the 1960s. At the time, the commission’s findings shocked many Americans because for the first time, “White racism” was noted as a major cause for the unequal status and living conditions of Black Americans, said the commission’s last surviving member, former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris. But the report’s findings and proposed solutions led nowhere. More than 50 years after the report, Harris, historians and policy experts tell CNN that change will only come when the people have the will and the government is truly honest about what must be done politically, socially and economically to address racial inequality. Jelani Cobb, historian and co-editor of “The Essential Kerner Commission Report,” tells CNN that people and institutions already know what the problem is and that the only action that needs to be taken now is actually following the recommendations of the commission, and pay the price that comes with it. “The actions are laid out, you really don’t need more recommendations,” Cobb said. “The fundamental observations (of the commission) have never been acted on.” The story continues…  Can a formula be racist? By Jacque Smith, Cassie Spodak, Jessi Esparza and Natalia V. Osipova, CNN When she first learned about race correction, Naomi Nkinsi was one of five Black medical students in her class at the University of Washington. Nkinsi remembers the professor talking about an equation doctors use to measure kidney function. The professor said eGFR equations adjust for several variables, including the patient’s age, sex and race. When it comes to race, doctors have only two options: Black or “Other.” Nkinsi was dumbfounded. “It was really shocking to me,” says Nkinsi, now a third-year medical and masters of public health student, “to come into school and see that not only is there interpersonal racism between patients and physicians … there’s actually racism built into the very algorithms that we use.” At the heart of a controversy brewing in America’s hospitals is a simple belief, medical students say: Math shouldn’t be racist. The argument over race correction has raised questions about the scientific data doctors rely on to treat people of color. It’s attracted the attention of Congress and led to a big lawsuit against the NFL. What happens next could affect how millions of Americans are treated… The story continues…  The three periods of the KKK ",Claudette Colvin;John Avlon;Andrew Johnson;Fred Harris;Rosa Parks;Rosa

177,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/weather/st-louis-flooding-thursday/,"A flash flood warning issued for the western suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, on Thursday morning came as the city is still reeling from last week’s destructive floods. Thursday’s warning, in effect until 11:45 a.m. CT, covers around half a million people in the communities of Kirkwood and Overland, as well as Lambert International Airport, the National Weather Service said. Doppler radar indicates between 2 and 4 inches of rain had already fallen on the area early Thursday, with between half an inch and 1 inch expected over the next hour or two, the weather service said.  The warning followed torrential rainfall overnight. Rain pounded the region at rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour. Wind gusts reached up to 60 mph and a flash flood warning impacting more than 1 million people was in effect for several hours.  The warning was lifted early Thursday for downtown St. Louis but remained in effect for the southern part of the city.  Overnight, there were reports of stranded motorists, flooded roads, and flooded basements, according to the weather service. Creeks were also rising and had exceeded levels reached last week. A whopping 2 inches of rain fell over Crestwood, Missouri, in just 23 minutes,the weather service said. Crestwood is a city on the outskirts of St. Louis. A resource center that opened for victims of last week’s flooding had to close earlier than expected Wednesday due to the new rainstorms, according to CNN affiliate KSDK. Hundreds of families had flocked to the center for assistance, the outlet said. “Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding. Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads,” the weather service warned.

452,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-four-killings/,"Authorities in Albuquerque, New Mexico, announced Saturday a fourth Muslim man was killed overnight and there is “reason to believe” his death is related to three other recent killings of Muslim men.  “These shootings are disturbing,” Albuquerque Police Department Chief Harold Medina said in a Saturday news conference. “We are putting every possible resource into these investigations.” The FBI is assisting in the investigation, the police department said in a news release.   New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also said on Twitter that she was sending additional state police officers to the city to work with local and federal authorities to bring “the killer or killers to justice – and they WILL be found.” “The targeted killings of Muslim residents of Albuquerque is deeply angering and wholly intolerable,” the governor tweeted. “We will continue to do everything we can to support to the Muslim community of Albuquerque and greater New Mexico during this difficult time. You are New Mexicans, you are welcomed here, and we stand with you.” Albuquerque police officers responded just before midnight Friday to reports of a shooting in the area of Truman St. and Grand Ave., and found the victim dead, according to the police department’s news release. The victim, a Muslim man believed to be in his mid-20s, was from South Asia, police said. His identity has not been positively confirmed, the release added.  The man’s death came a day after authorities determined there was a connection between the killings of Muhammed Afzaal Hussain, 27, and Aftab Hussein, 41, both Muslim and from Pakistan, who were killed in southeast Albuquerque within the past two weeks. Detectives are working to determine whether the November killing of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan, was also related. Ahmadi was killed outside of a business he ran with his brother, police said.  The victims in the first three cases were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the police department’s Criminal Investigations Division, previously said.  “Our top priority is keeping the community safe and we are asking the Muslim community especially, to be vigilant, to watch out for one another. If you see something, say something,” the police chief said Saturday. “Evil will not prevail.” There is a $15,000 reward for information that helps lead to an arrest, authorities announced.  “Albuquerque is on edge right now, and I want to be clear that we, and our partners across law enforcement, are directing every possible resource to these cases,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a statement. “We will protect our community and bring the perpetrator of these crimes to justice.” In a news release on Saturday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations announced it was raising its reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible to $10,000.  “The lives of Albuquerque Muslims are in danger. Whoever is responsible for this horrific, hateful shooting spree must be identified and stopped – now,” CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said in a statement.  “We thank local, state and federal law enforcement for their ongoing work on this crisis, and we call the Biden administration to ensure that authorities all of the resources needed to both protect the Albuquerque Muslim community and stop those responsible for these horrific crimes before they claim more innocent lives,” Mitchell added in the statement.

83,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/entertainment/pat-carroll-ursula-death-intl-scli/,"Pat Carroll, the Emmy-winning actress best known as the voice of the villainous sea witch Ursula in Disney’s “The Little Mermaid,” has died at the age of 95.  Carroll’s daughter, Kerry Karsian, told the Hollywood Reporter that her mother died from pneumonia at her home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts on Saturday.  Carroll’s other daughter, Tara Karsian, paid tribute to the star in an Instagram post on Sunday, asking fans to “honor her by having a raucous laugh at absolutely anything today (and everyday forward) because besides her brilliant talent and love, she leaves my sister Kerry and I with the greatest gift of all, imbuing us with humor and the ability to laugh…even in the saddest of times.”  Born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1927, Carroll landed her first major role in the 1948 film “Hometown Girl.”  Over the next seven decades, she went on to appear in TV shows including “The Danny Thomas Show,” “The Red Skelton Show,” “Busting Loose” and “ER,” and she also guest-starred on “The DuPont Show” with June Allyson.  In 1956, she was awarded an Emmy for her work on Sid Caesar’s sketch comedy series “Caesar’s Hour.”  In 1981, she won a Grammy for Best Spoken Word, Documentary or Drama for the recording of her one-woman show “Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein.”  Carroll landed her first voiceover gig in 1966, for the animated television series “The Super 6.” In 1988, she voiced the role of Granny in the English version of the Japanese classic animation “My Neighbor Totoro.” But it was her performance a year later as one of Disney’s most memorable villains, in “The Little Mermaid,” that catapulted her to international fame.  She also provided the vocals for the sea witches’ signature song, “Poor Unfortunate Souls.”   She later described the character of Ursula as one of her favorites and reprised the role in several “Little Mermaid” sequels, spinoffs,  videogames and even theme park rides.  “My desire before I kicked the bucket was to do a Disney film,” Carroll told “The Complete Pioneers of Television Interview” earlier this year.  She added that she was “so thrilled” when she got a call from Disney to play the role a year after auditioning six times and prepared by pretending that Ursula was an ex-Shakespearean actress who sold used cars.  “I’ve never enjoyed anything so much in my life and I’m still getting fan mail from children around the world.”  ",Gertrude Stein;Gertrude Stein;Gertrude Stein;Pat Carroll;Pat Carroll;Pat Carroll;Kerry Karsian;June Allyson;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Sid Caesar;Tara Karsian,Instagram;Disney;Disney;Disney;Disney;Disney;Disney;Cnn;Pioneers Of Television Interview,"TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,1615;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,1615;TAX_DISEASE_PNEUMONIA,275;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,275;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MASSACHUSETTS,330;MEDIA_MSM,239;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,239;KILL,141;KILL,260;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,141;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,260;TAX_FNCACT_WITCH,94;TAX_FNCACT_WITCH,786;TAX_FNCACT_WITCH,876;TAX_WORLDFISH_COD,299;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,42;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,1962;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,2025;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,2540;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,88;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,780;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,870;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1863;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2650;TAX_ETHNICITY_JAPANESE,1639;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_JAPANESE,1639;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2559;",Cape Cod;Hollywood;Japanese;Louisiana;Massachusetts
483,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/arkansas-judge-lake-death-jeremiah-bueker/,"An Arkansas judge was found dead at the bottom of a lake Sunday after he went missing during a trip with family and friends over the weekend, authorities said. Arkansas County Northern District Judge Jeremiah Bueker, 48, was in Jefferson County for “recreational travel” with his loved ones, but at some point during the trip he “ventured off alone” and was not seen alive again, according to a Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office news release. His death is being investigated as an accidental drowning, the office said. Bueker was last seen near Mud Lake, where his body was later found, the sheriff’s office reported. “After time had passed and no one had seen or heard from Bueker, worry began to set in,” the release said. “A search for Bueker by family and friends began.” After the sun set, the family had still not found Bueker, so they called 911, the release said. An extensive ground and water search was conducted late into the night and early morning by the sheriff’s office and wildlife officers with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Eventually, the search had to be paused due to low visibility, the sheriff’s office said.  On Sunday morning, the search resumed as authorities scoured the lake using boats with side-scan sonar, which allowed them to get “a birds-eye view of the water,” Sheriff Lafayette Woods Jr. said in the release. “At approximately 9:16 a.m., the side-scan sonar revealed a body on the bottom of the lake,” and deputies pulled the body from the water, the sheriff’s office said. The family helped authorities identify the recovered body as Bueker’s and an autopsy will be performed by the State Medical Examiner, the sheriff’s office said.  “I truly pray that the successful recovery of Judge Bueker’s body by our deputies and Arkansas Game and Fish Wildlife Officers brings some sense of closure to the Bueker family and those who knew him best,” Woods said. CNN has reached out to the Stuttgart District Court, where Bueker served as district judge. April Davis, the deputy coroner for Jefferson County who responded to the scene, said there were no signs of foul play. She noted the body was intact with no signs of trauma. According to Davis, a State Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy is standard procedure. The body was transported to the office on Sunday and the autopsy is expected to be performed this week, with a report expected in about three to six months, she said. Mud Lake is in Jefferson County and lies about 75 miles southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas. Correction: An earlier version of this story, along with a map, gave the wrong location for Mud Lake. It is in Jefferson County, Arkansas. CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.

352,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/middleeast/israel-lapid-nuclear-remarks-intl/,"Israel’s Prime Minister Yair Lapid made a rare allusion to the country’s widely suspected nuclear arsenal during a speech on Monday.  Speaking at an event to mark a change of leadership at the country’s Atomic Energy Commission, Lapid referred to Israel’s defensive and offensive capabilities, as well as what he called its “other capabilities” – understood to be a reference to nuclear weapons.   “The operational arena in the invisible dome above us is built on defensive capabilities and offensive capabilities, and what the foreign media tends to call ‘other capabilities.’ These other capabilities keep us alive and will keep us alive so long as we and our children are here,” Lapid said.  Israel is widely believed to possess a few hundred nuclear weapons, developing the technology in the 1960s. Unlike most assumed nuclear weapons states, Israel has never formally declared possession.  Instead it pursues a policy of ‘opacity’ – meaning Israeli leaders, when pushed, have preferred to make only oblique or ambiguous reference to nukes.   The first such statement was made in the early 1960s by then junior defense minister Shimon Peres who said that Israel would “certainly not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the region.”  More recently, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert appeared to acknowledge the nuclear capability when he listed Israel, along with the United States, Russia and France, as having nuclear weapons, though he later attempted to row back the comments, which were made on German television.  Benjamin Netanyahu too once referred to Israel as a “nuclear power” during a presentation to his Cabinet, before he corrected himself to say “energy power.” ",Benjamin Netanyahu;Ehud Olmert;Yair Lapid;Yair Lapid;Yair Lapid;Shimon Peres,Atomic Energy Commission;United States,"TAX_ETHNICITY_GERMAN,1681;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_GERMAN,1681;MEDIA_MSM,1692;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,1107;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,548;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,548;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,548;LEADER,43;LEADER,968;LEADER,1042;LEADER,1442;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,43;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,968;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,1042;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,1442;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,903;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,977;WB_508_POWER_SYSTEMS,1761;WB_509_NUCLEAR_ENERGY,1761;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,1761;TAX_FNCACT_CARETAKER,953;TAX_FNCACT_CARETAKER,1027;USPEC_POLICY1,1072;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1072;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,670;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,43;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,968;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1042;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1290;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1442;WMD,405;WMD,758;WMD,836;WMD,1386;WMD,1600;",Israeli;Israel;Jerusalem;France;United States;German;Israelis;Russia
456,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/mckinney-fire-dead-fish-klamath-river/,"“Tens of thousands” of dead fish have washed up along the Klamath River in the area of Happy Camp in northern California this week – a phenomenon that’s tied to a dangerous combination of flash flooding and the McKinney Fire that’s burning in the area, according to Craig Tucker, a policy advocate for the Karuk Tribe.  The blaze, which has killed at least four people, erupted on July 29 in the Klamath National Forest near the Oregon border. It’s the largest wildfire in California so far this year. Meanwhile, intense thunderstorms and heavy rains that rolled through the region this week prompted a flash flood warning for Klamath River from the National Weather Service on Tuesday. Officials warned that areas that had been burned by the wildfire were at higher risk of floods and mudflows – because of the lack of vegetation that would have otherwise been there to help absorb the water.  According to the US Geological Survey, “fast-moving, highly destructive debris flows” caused by heavy rainfall are “one of the most dangerous post-fire hazards.” According to a news release from the Karuk Tribe, their preliminary observations suggest “massive debris flows” following the flash floods in areas impacted by the blaze are the cause for the dead fish.  “We know the dissolved oxygen in the river plummeted two nights in a row as these pulses of mud hit the main stem of the river, so it is very clear to us that we had a high intensity fire and then we had a flash flooding event kind of come behind the fire and it just rushed ash and debris and mud into the river,” Tucker told CNN on Saturday.  “Virtually everything in the river died,” he said, adding that they don’t yet know for how many miles of the river the dead fish stretch as the area is still largely restricted because of the blaze.  “We are trying to work with the incident command for these wildfires to do a real assessment,” Tucker said. “We see there are thousands of fish floating downstream, but we really are having a difficult time figuring out how bad it is.” Dead fish have been seen as far as 20 miles from the source of the debris flow, the tribe’s news release said.  “The severity of the event is impossible to characterize until biologists can make direct observations in currently restricted areas,” the release said, adding it’s unknown how this might affect the fall migration of Chinook salmon, which is just starting. The fire, which has been burning in Siskiyou County for more than a week, has scorched more than 60,000 acres of land and was 30% contained as of Saturday morning as hot, dry and breezy conditions continued, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Its cause is under investigation, officials said.

79,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/investing/alibaba-stock-delisting-threat-intl-hnk/,"Alibaba shares fell after US regulators added the stock to a growing list of Chinese firms that might be kicked off Wall Street if US auditors can’t inspect their financial statements. Alibaba\n            \n                (BABA) slid as much as 6% in Hong Kong on Monday morning, but then pared losses to 3.8% in the afternoon.  On Friday, Alibaba’s US-listed shares plunged 11% after the Securities and Exchange Commission put the company on its watchlist.   Investors have been concerned about the tech giant for years now. In late 2020, Alibaba was caught up in a sweeping crackdown in China on the country’s booming technology sector. The stock has fallen nearly 70% from its all-time high.  The crackdown, coupled with a weakening economy, has slowed the revenue growth for many tech companies and wiped out billions of dollars from Chinese companies’ market cap.   The SEC has the power to kick companies off Wall Street if they fail to allow US watchdogs to inspect their financial audits for three straight years.  China has for years rejected US audits of its firms, citing national security concerns. It requires companies that are traded overseas to hold their audit papers in mainland China, where they cannot be examined by foreign agencies.  So far, the SEC has added more than 150 companies to its watch list, including Didi, JD.com\n            \n                (JD), Baidu\n            \n                (BIDU), and Yum China Holdings\n            \n                (YUMC). On Monday, Alibaba said it would monitor market developments and “strive to maintain its listing status on both the NYSE and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.”  Last week, the company announced it would seek a primary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, a move seen by many analysts as preparing for a potential loss of direct access to US capital market. Currently, Alibaba has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. “A primary listing status in Hong Kong gives Chinese ADRs (American Depository Shares) an optionality to diversify their listing risk and retain access to the public equity market” if they are forced to leave the United States, said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report last week. Alibaba’s smooth transition of listing status could also “set the path” for many more Chinese ADRs to pursue a similar switch, Citi analysts said separately. — CNN Business’ Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.",,Exchange Commission;Hong Kong Stock Exchange;Hong Kong Stock Exchange;Hong Kong Stock Exchange;Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd;Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd;Goldman Sachs;Yum China Holdings;United States,"ECON_STOCKMARKET,56;ECON_STOCKMARKET,842;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1699;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1799;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1981;WB_698_TRADE,1314;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1046;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1440;EPU_CATS_FINANCIAL_REGULATION,1046;EPU_CATS_FINANCIAL_REGULATION,1440;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1911;WB_332_CAPITAL_MARKETS,1911;USPEC_POLICY1,932;EPU_ECONOMY,932;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,932;SOC_TECHNOLOGYSECTOR,831;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1266;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1266;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1266;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1266;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATORS,40;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,781;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,897;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1266;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2391;WB_2943_SWITCHES,2391;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2391;WB_672_NETWORK_MANAGEMENT,2391;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2391;WB_334_EQUITY_MARKETS,2168;WB_1918_SECURITIES_MARKETS,2168;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,1839;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,2244;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,2407;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2059;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,84;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1015;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2045;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2359;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,84;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1015;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2045;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2359;",Hong Kong;United States;Chinese;Beijing;China

Penguin Random House announced its bid to acquire Simon & Schuster in November 2020. The deal – combining two of the top five book publishers in the United States – normally would have taken effect by now. But the Justice Department is standing in the way, and an antitrust trial is set to begin on Monday. Judge Florence Pan of the US District Court in Washington, D.C. will hear about three weeks of oral arguments. The government says, in its pre-trial brief, that the publisher combo “would further entrench the largest publishing giant in the United States (and the world) and give the merged company control of nearly half of the market to acquire anticipated top-selling books from authors.” The publishers say that “after the merger, the market dynamic will be just the same” and reject the arguments that authors will suffer. “The closely watched case holds major implications for a publishing industry that has been grappling with consolidation for years,” Publishers Weekly reporter Andrew Albanese writes. “It also looms as a key test for the government amid growing calls for more vigilant antitrust enforcement, and in the wake of a stinging defeat in 2018 in its bid to block the massive $85 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner.” Other publishing houses argue that the merger would be anticompetitive. But the government bears the burden of proof. “The lawsuit will test whether the government can mount more antitrust cases targeting the effects of corporate concentration on how much workers — in this case, writers of major books — get paid,” the NYT’s overview of the lawsuit notes. The judge is expected to rule in November…  Further reading Simon & Schuster (which, full disclosure, was the publisher of my most recent book) is going to be sold by Paramount Global one way or another. Speculation abounds about potential private equity bidders. But for now, the buyer is Penguin Random House, and S&S CEO Jonathan Karp (who previously spent 16 years at PRH) said in a recent memo to staffers that “we, and our authors, will benefit greatly from becoming a part of this superb publishing company.” >> “Regardless of the outcome,” Karp wrote, there will be a new owner, and “the best and most important thing we can do is to remain focused on achieving excellence on behalf of our authors and their books, assured in our purpose…” >> Vanity Fair’s Joe Pompeo (whose book publisher is HarperCollins, which reportedly lost out on the bidding for S&S) reports that “the witness list is a who’s who of publishing bosses, power agents, and authors,” including Stephen King… >> “An appearance at some point by King, whose works are published by Simon & Schuster, will be a highly unusual for an antitrust trial and will draw wide attention,” the AP’s Marcy Gordon writes in this great explainer… >> Another big antitrust trial is getting underway in DC on Monday: The government is also trying to block insurer UnitedHealth Group from buying Change Healthcare. “The cases represent a conscious strategy by the Justice Department to expand the frontiers of merger enforcement,” the WSJ says…",Jonathan Karp;Simon Schuster;Simon Schuster;Simon Schuster;Andrew Albanese;Joe Pompeo;Stephen King;Florence Pan;Marcy Gordon,Time Warner;Us District Court;Harpercollins;Justice Department;Justice Department;Unitedhealth Group;United States;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_BUYER,2026;TRIAL,1501;TRIAL,1731;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,562;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1180;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1462;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1534;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3002;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,562;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1180;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1462;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1534;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3002;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLISHER,612;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLISHER,1864;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLISHER,2515;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,395;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1227;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1559;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2830;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2943;WB_406_COMPETITION_POLICY,395;WB_406_COMPETITION_POLICY,1227;WB_406_COMPETITION_POLICY,1559;WB_406_COMPETITION_POLICY,2830;WB_406_COMPETITION_POLICY,2943;WB_2101_ANTITRUST,395;WB_2101_ANTITRUST,1227;WB_2101_ANTITRUST,1559;WB_2101_ANTITRUST,2830;WB_2101_ANTITRUST,2943;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,395;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1227;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1559;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2830;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2943;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,344;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3140;WB_840_JUSTICE,344;WB_840_JUSTICE,3140;MEDIA_MSM,1109;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,1109;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BEARS,1468;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,436;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1750;TAX_FNCACT_BOSSES,2647;ECON_MONOPOLY,1444;TAX_FNCACT_AGENTS,2662;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,1397;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1239;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3197;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2062;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2341;TAX_FNCACT_KING,2699;TAX_FNCACT_KING,2740;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1634;MEDICAL,3083;TAX_FNCACT_STAFFERS,2140;",Washington;New York;United States

Republicans probably did not end up redrawing their way into the five congressional seats they need to take control of the House of Representatives, at least not on paper. Instead, matching GOP gains in places like Texas and Florida with Democratic gains in blue states, Republicans nationwide ended up with nine new seats leaning toward them compared to eight now-Democratic seats based on their 2020 presidential performance, according to a 50-state analysis of the new congressional map by CNN’s political and data teams. It has the latest new congressional map for each state. The larger story may not be that one party or the other gained seats, but rather that the number of competitive seats dropped by 17, part of a decades-long trend of polarization among voters and consolidation of power by political parties. What’s a competitive district? In the current situation, just 34 of the 435 seats – less than 10% – are competitive districts, down 17 from when the maps were lasted used in 2020.  For the purposes of this CNN analysis, which applied 2020 election results to newly drawn districts, “competitive” refers to districts that either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 5 percentage points or less. The competitive landscape of 34 districts in the CNN analysis is more than enough to swing control of the 435-member House of Representatives, and a wave in either direction could even put districts that were not competitive in previous elections in play. Parties capitalized in specific places Republicans in Texas gained 10 GOP-leaning seats, according to the CNN analysis. But there are 10 fewer competitive seats in Texas. Democrats there gained two seats.  In Florida, where Republicans hijacked the process from a more nonpartisan system urged by voters, there are three new GOP-leaning seats and two fewer Democratic-leaning seats. Democrats capitalized in Illinois, where there are three new Democratic-leaning seats, one less Republican-leaning seat, and zero competitive districts. That’s also the case in states such as Georgia, Missouri and Nebraska. The process is changing for the better nationwide Princeton professor Samuel Wang, who runs the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, factors multiple recent elections, instead of just 2020 Biden versus Trump data, into his analysis. He also notes a decline of competitive seats between 2020 and 2022, but an increase of competitive seats since 2012, which he views as “banner year for gerrymandering” for Republicans, although their advantage has gradually faded at the national level. “One big reason is improvements in the redistricting process,” Wang told me, pointing to independent commissions and neutral map-drawing processes that have taken over in key states and what his organization views as better congressional maps in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina, and New York. Fewer competitive districts. But there will be competition Professional handicappers use a multitude of factors to determine which races might actually be in play.  The website Inside Elections identifies 54 districts as battlegrounds and just 11 of those are in the tossup category. “There might be fewer swing districts, but that doesn’t mean there are fewer competitive races,” Inside Elections editor Nathan Gonzales, a CNN analyst, told me in an email. More safe Republican districts added than Democratic districts Another organization, Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, finds an increase in the number of very safe Republican districts where Biden got 40% or less of the vote in 2020. There are marginally fewer districts that are very safe for Democrats and more districts where Biden won by between 2 and 7 percentage points. That suggests Democrats, more than Republicans, will be on defense in the new maps, perhaps even in races that are not on the competitive list. A wave could reach deep into Biden territory There is a difference between competitive seats, which have been declining, and competitive races, of which there can be many. “What districts actually are ‘competitive’ changes from cycle to cycle,” Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, told me in an email. “For instance, there probably will be several double-digit Biden seats that Republicans end up having a good chance to flip this year, particularly if the wind is at their back in the fall (we’ll see if that happens).”   He also made the important point that what seems like a safe district for Republicans or Democrats today, might look very different an election or two away. KONDIK: Plenty of districts drawn to be safely Republican in places like Georgia and Texas got much more competitive over the course of the 2010s as Donald Trump pushed away a lot of traditional suburban Republican voters. Likewise, Trump made several typically Democratic districts in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania more competitive after he ascended to the top of the GOP and shook loose a lot of Barack Obama voters. Voter coalitions change over time, and they can change in ways that are hard to predict. The district most like the country Kondik has argued that based on 2020 results, the new House district most like the country at large is in Kansas, where voters this week turned out to support abortion rights. Specifically, he points to the lone Kansas district held by a Democrat, Rep. Sharice Davids. Her newly redrawn district was made more competitive by Republicans who controlled redistricting in the state. Parties are switching control of Congress more frequently Professor Alan Abramowitz at Emory  University has written that the overall polarization may have less to do with gerrymandering than many people think. Even as parties have engineered fewer competitive districts, control of Congress has changed hands with more regularity  – three times since 2002 and decent odds for a fourth in November, compared with just once from 1972 to 2000. One reason: incumbents have less power and there is a lot more churn in even moderately competitive districts. Which way is the wind blowing?  Suddenly Democrats might have some reason for optimism in what is still expected to be an extremely tough political environment when control of Capitol Hill is on the line in November. But over all of this looms the persistent inflation that’s made American life more expensive and helped build a deep pessimism about the economy has helped keep Biden’s job approval at or below 40%, which is a telling indicator as more and more districts become more solidly partisan.",Kyle Kondik;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Barack Obama;Nathan Gonzales;Sharice Davids;Samuel Wang;Joe Biden,Supreme Court;Professor Alan Abramowitz At Emory University;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,200;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,595;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,666;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,2931;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,131;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,402;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1653;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1841;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2631;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3949;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,4460;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,4675;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5623;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,6600;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,131;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,402;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1653;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1841;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2631;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3949;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4460;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4675;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5623;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6600;ECON_INFLATION,6994;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,6994;WB_442_INFLATION,6994;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,6682;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,5532;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2814;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2814;WB_838_PUBLIC_ACCOUNTABILITY_MECHANISMS,2814;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,6908;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,5396;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,5504;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,6756;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVES,264;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVES,1485;KILL,6566;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,6566;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,6566;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,6566;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,5710;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,5962;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,5710;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,5962;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,7013;LEGISLATION,6520;LEGISLATION,6634;USPEC_POLICY1,6520;USPEC_POLICY1,6634;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,6520;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,6634;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,6508;LEADER,1267;LEADER,1296;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1267;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1296;PIRACY,1850;TAX_ECON_PRICE,7033;EDUCATION,2284;EDUCATION,5738;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2284;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,5738;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,616;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,913;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,6350;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENTS,6113;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,3425;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,4327;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1786;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1992;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,3840;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,3933;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,4687;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,6253;ELECTION,875;ELECTION,1909;ELECTION,4963;ELECTION,5160;ELECTION,5411;TAX_WEAPONS_GUNS,6642;ALLIANCE,5178;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,6930;WB_470_EDUCATION,6930;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,6930;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,6930;GENERAL_HEALTH,6503;MEDICAL,6503;EPU_ECONOMY,7083;SOC_POLARIZED,862;SOC_POLARIZED,5816;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,862;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,5816;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGING_EDITOR,4327;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,3457;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3608;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,5774;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3503;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3713;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4804;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4956;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4616;WB_2745_JOB_QUALITY_AND_LABOR_MARKET_PERFORMANCE,6884;WB_2670_JOBS,6884;WB_2689_JOBS_DIAGNOSTICS,6884;WB_2748_EMPLOYMENT,6884;",Pennsylvania;North Carolina;Ohio;Illinois;Kansas;Princeton;Americans;Michigan;Georgia;Nebraska;New York;Virginia;Texas;Missouri;Florida;American;University Of Virginia
234,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/florida-turtles-born-female-climate-change/,"Florida’s sea turtles are grappling with a unique problem made worse by climate change: recent heat waves have caused the sand on some beaches to get so hot that nearly every turtle born was female. “The frightening thing is the last four summers in Florida have been the hottest summers on record,” said Bette Zirkelbach, manager of the Turtle Hospital in Marathon, a city in the Florida Keys, which is a string of tropical islands stretching from the southern end of the state. “Scientists that are studying sea turtle hatchlings and eggs have found no boy sea turtles, so only female sea turtles for the past four years,” Zirkelbach said, whose turtle center has operated since 1986. The trend is just one of many signs that the climate crisis is interfering with the Earth’s natural ecosystems, advancing too rapidly for many species to adapt. When a female turtle digs a nest on a beach, the temperature of the sand determines the sex of the hatchlings. Zirkelbach said an Australian study showed similar statistics — “99% of new sea turtle babies are female.”  Instead of determining sex during fertilization, the sex of sea turtles and alligators depends on the temperature of developing eggs, according to the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). If a turtle’s eggs incubate below 81.86 Fahrenheit (27.7 Celsius), the turtle hatchlings will be male, whereas if they incubate above 88.8 F (31C), they will be female, according to NOAA’S National Ocean Service website. “Over the years, you’re going to see a sharp decline in their population because we just don’t have the genetic diversity,” said Melissa Rosales Rodriguez, a sea turtle keeper at the recently opened a turtle hospital at the Miami Zoo. “We don’t have the male-to-female ratio needed in order to be able to have successful breeding sessions.” The two turtle hospitals are also battling tumors in turtles known as fibropapillomatosis, also known as FP. These tumors are contagious to other turtles and can cause death if not treated. With climate affecting the future of turtles and the disease being so widespread, Zirkelbach sees the need to save every turtle she can and open more rehab centers. “The Turtle Hospital was the first. But, sadly and fortunately, there’s a need all throughout Florida.” Clarification: This story has been updated to be clear that the climate crisis is having an effect on the biological sex of the sea turtle hatchlings.",Melissa Rosales Rodriguez;Bette Zirkelbach,National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration;National Ocean Service,"TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLE,541;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLE,1064;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLE,1746;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,333;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,2177;WB_1406_DISEASES,2177;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2177;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2177;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BETTE,312;GENERAL_HEALTH,356;GENERAL_HEALTH,1145;GENERAL_HEALTH,1794;GENERAL_HEALTH,2302;MEDICAL,356;MEDICAL,1145;MEDICAL,1794;MEDICAL,2302;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,356;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1145;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1794;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,2302;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,356;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1145;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1794;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2302;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,185;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,347;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,541;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,666;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,879;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1064;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1116;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1136;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1370;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1433;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1746;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1785;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,1942;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,2245;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLE,2293;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1003;WB_615_GENDER,56;WB_615_GENDER,954;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,20;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,534;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,581;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,610;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1057;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1213;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1739;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,95;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,95;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,95;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,95;TAX_DISEASE_CONTAGIOUS,2065;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,805;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,805;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITALS,1952;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,114;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_ALLIGATORS,1234;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_EGGS,559;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_EGGS,1280;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_EGGS,1375;TAX_FNCACT_BABIES,1071;AFFECT,2141;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,28;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,589;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,618;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,1221;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,1988;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,2082;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_TURTLES,2163;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLES,28;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLES,589;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLES,618;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SEA_TURTLES,1221;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,108;",Florida Keys;Florida;Australian;Miami
649,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/parkland-shooting-sentencing-massacre-scene/,"Editor’s Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of gun violence that readers might find disturbing. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s 1200 building has been sealed since the massacre on February 14, 2018. On Thursday, jurors in the sentencing phase of the school shooter’s trial walked through the undisturbed scene, where the blood of the victims still stains classroom floors. Bullet holes also mark the walls of the Parkland, Florida, school where Nikolas Cruz killed 14 students and three staff members.  A lock of dark hair remains on a floor more than four years after the body of a victim was taken away. Valentine’s Day gifts and cards are strewn about, as shards of glass crunched beneath of the feet of visitors.  These are the unsettling notes from a group of reporters allowed to enter the building after jurors completed their walk-through to provide details to media outlets across the country, including CNN.  FIRST FLOOR  We entered from the east stairwell just as Cruz did. In the stairwell where Cruz entered and assembled his gun, a stuffed white teddy bear lay dirtied on the floor next to a bag with Valentine’s Hearts on it, probably dropped by a fleeing student.  Everywhere you walk throughout the building there are shards of broken safety glass that crunch loudly as you walk over them. They are especially loud and crunchy in the threshold of each door.  ROOM 1218   Brittany Sinitch’s English class: No one was killed or wounded here, but this is where Cruz fired first his shots. Textbooks on the desks were open to a section discussing Mercutio. A Valentine’s teddy bear was on a desk. A 2017 Stoneman Douglas football poster was on the wall – photo of the team with the motto: Faith Family Football. A pink note wishing a Happy Valentine’s Day sat on a desk next to a worksheet belonging to student Sarah Louis. A clear plastic drink cup sat half-full on a desk, its contents now a dark brown sludge. On a desk a Valentine’s Day card that reads “I don’t just like you, I really, really like you.”   ROOM 1215   Study Hall led by Spanish teacher Juletta Matlock: There is dried blood outside the door where Luke Hoyer, Martin Duque and Gina Montalto were killed. Just inside the door, some earphones with a long cord lay on the floor. The book “To Kill a Mockingbird” remains on a desk. On the wall is a poster titled “Let’s Guac About It” with basic Spanish words: Padre, Madre, Abuelo, Abuela.” On another wall is a poster of common Spanish phrases and colors.  ROOM 1213 – Ronit Reoven’s AP Psychology class: On the far wall away from the door is a table with a large pool of blood. This is where Carmen Schentrup died from a bullet wound to the head. She and the children hid behind the teacher’s desk, which is in the southeast corner of the room. In front of the desk where Maddy Wilford lay wounded, the teacher’s desk phone lay on the floor. On the walls behind the desk are photos of what appears to be the teacher’s family and a 8 X 10 drawing of President Trump with the saying “We will win in everything we do.” On the north wall is a bulletin board with about two dozen wallet size photos of students. A lone white sneaker remains on the floor.  HALLWAY - HIXON SITE Hixon, after he was shot dashing through the west door, took cover in an alcove in front of the elevator about 20 feet from the door. Cruz shot him a second time as he passed, but he remained alive and spent about 10 minutes trying to get up, according to video played in court. There is a large bloodstain on the floor and on the wall. A black rubber shoe, possibly, a Croc, lay on the floor there.  Room 1214 – “The Holocaust Room” - Teacher Ivy Schamis’ room  She taught Holocaust Studies. This is where Nick Dworet and Helena Ramsay died.  On the whiteboard is the hashtag #TogetherWeRemember. There are also references to eyewitness accounts. On a table are two yellowed Sun Sentinel newspapers, there are bullet strike marks on desks, laptops still open, headphones, and a water bottle still on a desk. On the floor is a tossed 2017-2018 school year planner. Blood-stained markings where Dworet and Ramsay died. Their blood coats a book called “Tell Them We Remember” by Susan Bachrach and “Listen to the Wind” by Greg Mortenson There is a Holocaust sign on a bulletin board with the words “we will never forget”. One desk had a white plug and earbuds on top. Indicating the rapid way everything unfolded  The learning objective on the board “To be aware of the world and its surroundings.”   Room 1216   No one classroom had as many of the murdered and wounded as Dara Hass’ English class. A blue folder with Alaina Petty’s name still on the desk - right behind that - between the teacher’s desk and the wall is a large bloodstain. Bullet holes in the walls.  Right next to the bloodstain on the floor where Alyssa Alhadeff and Alaina Petty died - is a handwritten paper about Malala Yousafzai - “the girl who wanted to go to school” - the paper goes on to say “a bullet went straight to her head but not her brain” ending with “In conclusion, we the people should have freedom for education.”   (Note: Malala is the Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban - she has fought to advocate for education access for girls and women).   Essays written by the students remain on their desks, never to be recovered. “We go to school every day of the week and we take it all for granted,” one student wrote. “We cry and complain without knowing how lucky we are to be able to learn.”  On cabinet doors, a previous assignment is on display. It shows headstones with epitaphs written by the students. “R.I.P. Here lies pretty.” “R.I.P. Here lies funny.” “R.I.P. Here lies nice.”  Next to a shoe on the ground is a pink Valentine’s Day stuffed animal and balloons.   The pooling of blood looks aged, dark, caked, flaky.   Desks are covered in a thin layer of dust, a landline phone lays upside on the ground.   At Alex Schachter’s desk - a bloodstain on other side of silver bar that connects the plastic seat to the desk.   WEST STAIRWELL  Near west stairs - where Hixon was shot - there is a discarded shoe.   SECOND FLOOR - HALLWAY QUOTES   Quote on hallway between rooms 1221 and 1229  “Dream as if you’ll live forever, live as if you’ll die today.” -James Dean   Further down the hallway it reads:  “Never live in the past but always Lear form it.” - anonymous   Room 1230  A large heart shaped box of Valentine’s Day chocolates on a desk.  On another an open pen and pencil case.   Room 1232 Calculators still on desks, spiral notebooks still open to math subject, students were working on algebra problems.   Room 1231 Clustered Desks   “Class of 2018” photos of students in casual settings (not formal pics).  THIRD FLOOR  Room 1256, Scott Beigel’s classroom:  Entering the hallway from the east side stairs, the first thing you see is a pool of caked blood that’s much smaller than others. This is where Scott Beigel’s body fell in front of classroom 1256. Unlike other rooms, the window on his door is intact. Beigel died holding the door open. His body blocked the door from closing. The children hiding in the front of his room were vulnerable, but Cruz did not choose to enter it.   Plastic world maps about the size of a placemat on most desks. There were three wall clocks lying face down by the door. On Beigel’s desk were worksheets comparing Christianity and Islam. On the whiteboard, notes on the 2018 Winter Olympics medal-winners. A deflated Valentine’s Day balloon lay on the ground.   Room 1255, Stacey Lippel’s classroom:  The door is pushed open – like others to signify that Cruz shot into it – and a “No Bully Zone” hangs on the inside. The creative writing assignment for the day is written on the whiteboard: “How to write the perfect love letter.”  The teacher’s desk is to the left and one can imagine students huddled behind it. The desks are in disarray, some pushed on top of each other from what was described in testimony as a mad rush back to get back inside. Atop one desk is an enviable Valentine’s Day spread – a large gift bag with tissues stuffed inside it, a box of round, silver-wrapped candies, and a heart-shaped box.   Moving down the hallway, dry, cracked rose petals mixed with the glass shards lend a cinematic feel to the scene. There’s a large pool of blood in the middle of the third-floor hallway where Anthony Borges was injured. A sign above the water fountains has a quote from Star Wars’ Yoda: “Do or do not. There is no try.”   Beneath the water fountains, three large pools of dried blood mark the spots to where authorities dragged the bodies of Cara Loughran, Meadow Pollack, and Joaquin Oliver. A faint trail of blood traces the path of the girls’ bodies from the alcove where their bodies fell after being shot. A pool of blood is observed in the alcove outside 1249 where Pollack and Loughran died. They remained there, injured, after the rest of the group that was huddled in the alcove with Ernie Rospierski fled down the hallway. Then Cruz returned and shot them again.    ROOM 1249, Ernie Rospierski   There is an unfinished chess game. A friend of Peter Yang testified they were playing a game when the fire alarm went off.  Room 1250  Valentine’s Day balloons, flower petals, stuffed white bear.  One of the most disturbing sights is the alcove outside the bathroom where Joaquin Oliver died. There’s a large pool of blood and holes from bullets that were fired at him at close range. There are blood drops leading into the alcove from the first shots where he was wounded. But most of the blood is from when Cruz caught up to Oliver in the alcove and fired. We know from the evidence that Oliver was conscious after he was hit. He could not run when the others fled. He heard Cruz coming. He heard the shots into Pollack and Loughran. He knew he was next. We know from testimony that he held his hands up to protect himself. Two bullets in the wall show how vain that attempt was. There’s a lock of dark hair on the floor near where his body would have been. The corner of a heart-shaped paper Valentine’s Day decoration (perhaps was a card) is collapsed, presumably was drenched with blood   Moving down the hall toward the west wall, bullets scraped against the south walls, an indication that Cruz was aiming for the fleeing students and not just randomly firing ahead of him.  We see the corner in front of the stairwell where Peter Wang fell after being shot as he ran down the hallway.  The wall is drawn into squares resembling search quadrants. It is stained with dark splotches of blood and yellow-greenish material that was described in testimony as brain matter. Pin-sized holes in the wall have circles drawn around them and are marked “fragment D” and “fragment F.”   There are six bullet holes in the window above where Wang died. Cruz tried to blow the windows out to shoot the fleeing students.  Jaime Guttenberg was struck outside the stairwell but fell inside. There is very little blood where she fell. The bullet never left her body.  In the teacher’s lounge, a windowpane facing the 1300 building has 4 bullet holes. Another windowpane next to it has another bullet hole. These overlook the courtyard and a parking lot where students were fleeing.  A poster next to a windowpane reads like so:  “Typical or Troubled? Notice: Notice if you are seeing troubling signs in a student.  Talk: Talk with the student  Act: Share observations with school mental health staff Changing a life’s course.

271,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/manchin-deal-gas-pipeline-permitting-climate/,"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Democratic leadership have agreed to advance a stalled natural gas pipeline in Manchin’s home region as part of a larger deal to reform federal environmental permitting, according to a one-page summary Manchin’s office shared with CNN. The permitting deal was struck between Manchin, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to secure Manchin’s vote on the larger economic and clean energy package.  Manchin would not have come on board unless Democratic leaders vowed to enact legislation addressing the permitting of energy infrastructure, which could ease the path for the pipeline, CNN has previously reported. The party’s leadership agreed to fast-track the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline located in the Appalachian region. Manchin and the rest of West Virginia’s congressional delegation are strong advocates for the project. It’s not clear how this deal struck in Congress would speed the completion of the project, since it has been delayed due to litigation. Environmental advocates and landowners concerned with private property rights have opposed the pipeline. The one-page summary says the agreement will “require the relevant agencies to take all necessary actions to permit the construction and operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline and give the DC Circuit jurisdiction over any further litigation.” The permitting reforms will likely be tackled in a separate bill later this fall that will need support from Senate Republicans in addition to Democrats. West Virginia news station WOWK13 first reported the deal. The permitting agreement would set two-year maximum timelines for energy project permitting reviews, including environmental reviews through the National Environmental Policy Act. It would designate a lead agency to coordinate interagency review and also work to expedite certain major interstate electricity transmission projects.",Joe Manchin;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden;Joe Biden,Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer;Senate Republicans;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;National Environmental Policy,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1711;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,1046;WB_1785_ENVIRONMENTAL_POLICIES_AND_INSTITUTIONS,1969;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1969;WB_598_ENVIRONMENTAL_MANAGEMENT,1969;WB_849_ENVIRONMENTAL_LAWS_AND_REGULATIONS,1969;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,692;DELAY,92;MEDIA_MSM,1766;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,439;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,439;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,439;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,439;PROPERTY_RIGHTS,1306;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,1306;WB_1907_PERSONAL_PROPERTY_RIGHTS,1306;WB_1039_PROPERTY_LAWS_AND_REGULATIONS,1306;EPU_ECONOMY,431;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,431;WB_549_OIL_AND_GAS_SYSTEMS,113;WB_549_OIL_AND_GAS_SYSTEMS,961;WB_1768_OIL_AND_GAS_PIPELINE,113;WB_1768_OIL_AND_GAS_PIPELINE,961;NEGOTIATIONS,481;NEGOTIATIONS,566;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,481;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,566;WB_840_JUSTICE,481;WB_840_JUSTICE,566;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,481;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,566;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,481;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,566;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,481;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,566;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,481;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,566;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,481;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,566;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,481;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,566;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,481;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,566;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1969;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1141;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,1141;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1736;WB_2299_PIPELINES,113;WB_2299_PIPELINES,815;WB_2299_PIPELINES,936;WB_2299_PIPELINES,961;WB_2299_PIPELINES,1332;WB_2299_PIPELINES,1509;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,113;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,815;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,936;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,961;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,1332;WB_539_OIL_AND_GAS_POLICY_STRATEGY_AND_INSTITUTIONS,1509;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,113;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,815;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,936;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,961;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,1332;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,1509;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,113;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,815;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,936;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,961;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,1332;WB_548_PPP_IN_OIL_AND_GAS,1509;LEGISLATION,719;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,719;USPEC_POLICY1,719;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,719;ENV_NATURALGAS,104;ENV_NATURALGAS,952;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1211;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,1211;WB_1979_NATURAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT,920;WB_1979_NATURAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT,1493;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,920;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,1493;WB_1986_MOUNTAINS,920;WB_1986_MOUNTAINS,1493;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,342;TAX_FNCACT_MAJORITY_LEADER,342;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,372;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1448;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,1448;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,1448;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,1448;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,193;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1244;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1919;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1962;EPU_POLICY_REFORM,171;",West Virginia;Washington
493,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/stephen-breyer-optimist/,"Justice Stephen Breyer made sure Saturday night to steer clear of any controversy in his first public appearance since he retired and the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade.  Instead, the 83-year-old retired justice spoke broadly about the rule of law and maintained that he remains an optimist overall. “I think over long periods of time we have in America a system that has adjusted – with its drawbacks and its going-the-wrong way from time to time,” he said. “But overall, I’m still an optimist,” Breyer added. Breyer made no mention of the string of losses for liberals at the end of last term on abortion, gun rights, the environment and religious liberty. Instead, addressing an audience of lawyers attending an American Bar Association Conference in Chicago, he repeated strains from past speeches and told the audience that the work of the ABA, and lawyers in general, is important.  He said that judges “need the help from the outside,” even if they may think that they don’t. Breyer repeated a story about assurances he gave to a judge visiting him from a foreign country several years ago about the rule of law. He said he told her about Bush v. Gore – the controversial Supreme Court decision that decided the 2000 presidential election – and how then-Democratic Sen. Harry Reid once emphasized that after the opinion was released that there was no rioting in the streets. “What Reid said,” Breyer recounted, is that maybe you know you have the rule of law “when enough people are prepared to accept an opinion that affects them personally that they don’t like.” (Breyer made no mention of recent events including the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack.) “This has not been a country of sheer ups you know,” Breyer said he told the visiting judge.  “There was a civil war, there was slavery, 80 years of Jim Crow segregation,” Breyer said speaking broadly. “But gradually we try … if this generation doesn’t, the next one might.” Breyer began his talk with a joke after he was praised for writing over 500 opinions from the bench. “There is one question I have about your introduction,” he said. “You said I’ve written 525 opinions – but why is the world in such a mess?” he said to laughter.",Harry Reid;Justice Stephen Breyer,American Bar Association Conference;Supreme Court;Supreme Court,"BAN,530;BAN,584;ARMEDCONFLICT,2062;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,2062;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,34;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,265;WB_840_JUSTICE,34;WB_840_JUSTICE,265;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1225;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1909;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1922;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1985;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1922;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1985;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,361;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,879;TAX_WORLDBIRDS_CROW,2098;RELIGION,804;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGES,1091;SOC_SLAVERY,2082;WB_2507_HUMAN_RIGHTS_ABUSES_AND_VIOLATIONS,2082;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2082;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2082;WB_2511_SLAVERY,2082;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1816;TRIAL,857;TRIAL,1030;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,857;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,1030;REBELLION,2062;WB_739_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_CIVIL_WAR,2062;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,2062;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,2062;SLFID_RULE_OF_LAW,301;SLFID_RULE_OF_LAW,1301;SLFID_RULE_OF_LAW,1641;ELECTION,1423;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,792;FIREARM_OWNERSHIP,774;TAX_WEAPONS_GUN,767;LEGISLATION,301;LEGISLATION,1301;LEGISLATION,1641;EPU_POLICY_LAW,301;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1301;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1641;PROTEST,1539;VIOLENT_UNREST,1539;",America;Chicago

Zawahiri, 71, was a key architect behind multiple assaults on the US, and was “deeply involved” in the planning of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, Biden said.  “People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer. The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm,” Biden said from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House. Here’s what you need to know about Zawahiri and the US’ strike against him.  How did Zawahiri rise to power? Born in 1951, Zawahiri grew up in an upper-class neighborhood in Cairo, Egypt, the son of a prominent physician and grandson of renowned scholars.  His grandfather, Rabia’a al-Zawahiri, was an imam at al-Azhar University in Cairo. His great-uncle, Abdel Rahman Azzam, was the first secretary of the Arab League. Zawahiri was imprisoned for his involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. “We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? Who are we?” he said in a jailhouse interview. By that time, Zawahiri, a young doctor, was already a committed terrorist who conspired to overthrow the Egyptian government for years and sought to replace it with fundamentalist Islamic rule. He proudly endorsed Sadat’s assassination after the Egyptian leader made peace with Israel. What was his relationship with Osama bin Laden? Zawahiri left Egypt in 1985 and made his way to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he worked as a surgeon treating the fighters who were engaged with Soviet troops in Afghanistan. That is where Zawahiri met bin Laden, a prominent Mujahedeen leader and who also had left behind a privileged upbringing to join the fight in Afghanistan. The two became close, linked by their common bond as “Afghan Arabs.” After reuniting in Afghanistan, bin Laden and Zawahiri appeared together in early 1998 announcing the formation of the World Islamic Front for the Jihad Against the Jews and the Crusaders – formally merging the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda.  At one point, he acted as bin Laden’s personal physician. “We are working with brother bin Laden,” he said in announcing the merger of his terror group in May 1998. “We know him since more than 10 years now. We fought with him here in Afghanistan.” Together, the two terror leaders signed a fatwa, or declaration: “The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim.” What role did Zawahiri play in al Qaeda’s attacks against the US? The attacks against the US and its facilities began shortly after bin Laden and Zawahiri’s fatwa, with the suicide bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 5,000 others.  Then, there was the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, when suicide bombers on a dinghy detonated their boat, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39 others. The culmination of Zawahiri’s terror plotting came on September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, headed for Washington, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back. Before and after the September 11 attacks, Zawahiri appeared on numerous video and audiotapes calling for attacks against Western targets and urging Muslims to support his cause. Some Egyptians traced Zawahiri’s anger toward the United States to what many Afghan Arabs felt was the CIA’s betrayal to support their cause after the Soviets left Afghanistan and the country slipped into tribal anarchy. Others date Zawahiri’s wrath to 1998, when US officials pushed for the extradition of a number of Egyptian Islamic Jihad members from Albania to stand trial in Egypt for terrorism. Zawahiri’s brother, Mohammad, told CNN in 2012, “Before you call me and my brother terrorists, let’s define its meaning. If it means those who are bloodthirsty merciless killers, then this is not what we are about,” he said. “We only try to regain some of our rights that have been hijacked by Western powers throughout history.” When did Zawahiri start leading al Qaeda? Zawahiri became al Qaeda’s leader after US forces killed bin Laden in 2011.  He was constantly on the move once the US-led invasion of Afghanistan began after the September 11 attacks. At one point, he narrowly escaped a US onslaught in the rugged, mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, an attack that left his wife and children dead. Zawahiri “was not a charismatic leader in the mold of bin Laden,” CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said Monday. “He didn’t prove to be a very competent leader of al-Qaeda. But the reason I think that he was killed in Afghanistan over the weekend was he was beginning to take a lot more risks.”  “According to the United Nations, he’d released kind of an unprecedented number of videos. Every time you record a video, there’s the chain of custody of that video, getting it out there, somebody maybe taking the video,” Bergen continued.  “So he was becoming more prominent. And, I think, it seems to me that may well have been the reason that he was detected.” In a briefing by a United Nations panel of experts last week it was noted that Zawahiri’s apparent increased comfort and ability to communicate has coincided with the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan and the consolidation of power of key al-Qaeda allies within their de-facto administration. The last known public address by Zawahiri was an audio message released on July 13 by the media arm of al Qaeda. How did the US kill Zawahiri? The US undertook “a precision counterterrorism operation” in Afghanistan targeting Zawahiri, who was sheltering in a safehouse in Kabul, a senior administration told reporters Monday.  According to the official, “a precise tailored airstrike” using two hellfire missiles was conducted at 9:48 p.m. ET on Saturday, July 30 – 6:18 a.m. Kabul time – via unmanned air strike and was authorized by Biden following weeks of meetings with his Cabinet and key advisers.  No American personnel were on the ground in Kabul at the time of the strike. CNN’s Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood, Natasha Bertrand and Donald Judd contributed to this report.

137,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/us-iran-sanctions/,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken backed a proposal from the European Union aimed at salvaging the Iran nuclear deal, saying Monday that the United States is “prepared to move forward on the basis of what’s been agreed,” but it is unclear if Iran is prepared to do the same. His comments come as hopes for reviving the 2015 agreement fade as Iran continues to breach its commitments under the deal and grow its nuclear program. The US withdrew from that deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018 under former President Donald Trump. Multiple rounds of indirect talks between the two sides have yet to yield a result.  The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, recently put forward a proposal that he described as “the best possible deal that (he), as facilitator of the negotiations, see as feasible,” noting that “after 15 months of intense, constructive negotiations and countless interactions with the JCPOA participants and the US, the space for additional significant compromises to reach an agreement has been exhausted.” “It is not a perfect agreement, but it addresses all essential elements and includes hard-won compromises by all sides,” Borrell wrote in a post Saturday. “Decisions need to be taken now to seize this unique opportunity to succeed, and to free up the great potential of a fully implemented deal. I see no other comprehensive or effective alternative within reach.” During a press availability at the United Nations on Monday, Blinken noted that “the EU has put forward a best proposal based on many, many months of discussions, negotiations, conversations.” “It’s very consistent with something that they put forward in March that we’ve we agreed to, that we would pursue it in March,” Blinken said. “But it remains to be seen whether Iran is willing and able to move forward.” “We continue to believe, as I said this morning, that that would be the best path forward – a return to compliance off both sides to the JCPOA, to make sure that we are putting Iran’s nuclear program back in a box and averting any kind of crisis,” he said. Tehran has also said they “stand ready to conclude the negotiations in a short order, should the other side be ready to do the same.” “We shared our proposed ideas, both on substance & form, to pave the way for a swift conclusion of Vienna negotiations which were aimed at fixing the damaging complicated situation caused by the U.S. unilateral & unlawful withdrawal,” Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani said on Twitter Sunday. “We work closely with our JCPOA partners, in particular the Coordinator, to give another chance to the U.S. to demonstrate good faith & act responsibly,” he said. New sanctions Earlier on Monday, the Biden administration unveiled a new tranche of sanctions targeting “illicit” support for the Iranian oil industry. Blinken said in a written statement that “until Iran is ready to return to full implementation of the JCPOA, we will continue to use our sanctions authorities to target exports of petroleum, petroleum products, and petrochemical products from Iran.” According to Blinken, Monday’s sanctions target “six entities facilitating illicit transactions related to Iranian petroleum as well as petroleum and petrochemical products, key sources of revenue for the Iranian government.”  The two entities sanctioned by the State Department are Pioneer Ship management PTE LTD, “a company that managed one liquified petroleum gas tanker, for serving as the commercial manager for a vessel that transported Iranian petroleum products” and Golden Warrior Shipping, Co. Ltd., which “has engaged in transactions related to Iranian petroleum and petroleum products, to include providing logistical support to the Iranian petroleum trade.” “The Department is further identifying the vessel Glory Harvest as blocked property of Golden Warrior Shipping Co. Ltd,” Blinken said. The US Treasury Department sanctioned “four entities that support Iran’s Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Commercial Co.,” which is under US sanction and “continues to be involved in the sale of Iranian petroleum products and petrochemical products abroad,” Blinken said. According to the Treasury Department, Monday’s sanctions build on those issued in June and July. They target a company based in the United Arab Emirates called Blue Cactus Heavy Equipment and Machinery Spare Parts Trading L.L.C., as well as Hong Kong- and Malaysia-based Farwell Canyon HK Limited, Shekufei International Trading Co., Limited, and  PZNFR Trading Limited, all of which supported PGPICC, according to the US Treasury.",Donald Trump;Antony Blinken,Golden Warrior Shipping Co;Us Treasury Department;Cnn;Iran Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Commercial Co;United States;United States;United States;Treasury Department;Treasury Department;Shekufei International Trading Co;Farwell Canyon,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1330;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1330;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,1528;TAX_FNCACT_PIONEER,1406;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,123;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2021;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,324;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,324;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,324;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,324;ENV_OIL,114;MARITIME_INCIDENT,1488;MARITIME,1488;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1411;SANCTIONS,68;SANCTIONS,579;SANCTIONS,2239;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,591;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,591;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,591;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,226;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1934;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2209;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2607;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,1934;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,2209;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,2607;WB_1045_TREASURY,1934;WB_1045_TREASURY,2209;WB_1045_TREASURY,2607;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,110;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1222;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1319;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1566;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1676;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1764;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,2114;WB_698_TRADE,1780;TAX_ETHNICITY_PERSIAN,1993;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_PERSIAN,1993;LEADER,781;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,781;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,781;TAX_FNCACT_WARRIOR,1602;TAX_FNCACT_WARRIOR,1883;TAX_ETHNICITY_ARAB,2324;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1558;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,217;",Tehran;Iran;United States;Washington;Iranian;United Arab Emirates
349,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/us-sanctions-alina-kabaeva/,"The US Treasury Department on Tuesday sanctioned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s reputed girlfriend as part of a series of measures targeting Russian elites in the Biden administration’s latest attempt to punish the Kremlin for its ongoing war in Ukraine. Alina Maratovna Kabaeva, who has been romantically linked to the Russian leader, was sanctioned “for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the Government of the Russian Federation,” a Treasury Department statement said. That statement describes the 39-year-old Kabaeva as having “a close relationship to Putin.” She is a former member of the State Duma “and is the current head of the National Media Group, a pro-Kremlin empire of television, radio, and print organizations.” In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that sanctioning Kabaeva was under consideration by the US, but there was concern that such a move would inflame tensions given her close proximity to Putin. Kabaeva was previously sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In addition to Kabaeva, the Treasury Department announced sanctions against a number of other oligarchs, a major steel production company and two of its subsidiaries as well as a financial institution accused of running a sanctions evasion operation and its general director.  Separately, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions on three oligarchs, a Russian state-owned company overseen by the Ministry of Transportation, “four individuals and one entity illegitimately operating in Ukraine’s territory in collaboration with Russia,” and 24 Russian defense and technology-related entities.  The US is also imposing visa restrictions on 893 Russian Federation officials and “31 foreign government officials who have acted to support Russia’s purported annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine and thereby threatened or violated Ukraine’s sovereignty,” Blinken said. Many of the designations announced by the US target oligarchs who were previously sanctioned by allies like the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the European Union. They come as the war in Ukraine has entered its sixth month.  ‘Opulent lifestyles’ “As innocent people suffer from Russia’s illegal war of aggression, Putin’s allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “The Treasury Department will use every tool at our disposal to make sure that Russian elites and the Kremlin’s enablers are held accountable for their complicity in a war that has cost countless lives.” The oligarchs sanctioned by the State Department Tuesday are Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, Alexander Anatolevich Ponomarenko, and Dmitry Aleksandrovich Pumpyanskiy. The yacht AXIOMA was identified as blocked property in which Pumpyanskiy has an interest, the State Department said in a fact sheet. According to that fact sheet, Ponomarenko “is an oligarch with close ties to other oligarchs and the construction of Vladimir Putin’s seaside palace” who has previously been sanctioned by the UK, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Among the oligarchs sanctioned by the Treasury Department Tuesday is Andrey Grigoryevich Guryev, the Russian billionaire founder of the chemical company “PhosAgro” and former government official described by the Treasury as “a known close associate” of Putin. He is also sanctioned by the UK, and according to the US Treasury, he “owns the Witanhurst estate, which is the second largest estate in London after Buckingham Palace.” The Treasury Department on Tuesday identified the yacht Alfa Nero, reportedly owned by AG Guryev, as blocked property. AG Guryev’s son, Andrey Andreevich Guryev, was also sanctioned by the US Tuesday, after previously being sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Switzerland, and the UK, as was his investment firm Dzhi AI Invest OOO. Natalya Valeryevna Popova was sanctioned “for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy, and for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of LLC VEB Ventures,” which is a sanctioned entity. She was also sanctioned for being the wife of Kirill Aleksandrovich Dmitriev, the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). Both he and the RDIF were sanctioned in the days following the start of the war.  The Joint Stock Company Promising Industrial and Infrastructure Technologies, “a financial institution owned by the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management,” and its General Director Anton Sergeevich Urusov were sanctioned Tuesday in relation to alleged sanctions evasion.  According to the Treasury Department, “JSC PPIT attempted to facilitate the circumvention of sanctions imposed on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).” The Treasury Department sanctioned Publichnoe Aktsionernoe Obschestvo Magnitogorskiy Metallurgicheskiy Kombinat (MMK), described as “one of the world’s largest steel producers,” the chairman of its board of directors Viktor Filippovich Rashnikov – who has also been sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the EU, Switzerland, and the UK – and two of MMK’s subsidiaries. “MMK is one of Russia’s largest taxpayers, providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation,” the Treasury Department said. The agency has authorized a wind-down period for transactions with MMK and one of its subsidiaries.

328,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/carolyn-maloney-apologizes-biden-2024-cnntv/,"Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York publicly apologized to President Joe Biden while standing by her comments earlier in the week that she didn’t believe he would run for reelection in 2024.  “Mr. President, I apologize. I want you to run. I happen to think you won’t be running, but when you run or if you run, I will be there 100%,” she said during an appearance on CNN “New Day” Thursday. Maloney, who’s running for reelection herself this year in the New York’s 12th Congressional District, had said “I don’t believe” Biden is running for reelection during a Tuesday night primary debate. The comments from Maloney drew attention as she’s the latest high profile Democrat to publicly cast doubt on a second Biden term. Asked Thursday by CNN’s Brianna Keilar why she thinks Biden won’t seek the White House again, Maloney replied that it was “just my own personal belief.” Pressed further, the New York congresswoman said: “Well, we are all entitled to have our own information and our own beliefs.”  She reiterated that she would support Biden if he decides to run, adding that “it’s totally his decision.”  A few Democrats have privately expressed concerns about Biden, who is approaching 80 and facing poor approval ratings, seeking a second term, while a few, including Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, have gone further in saying that Biden shouldn’t run.  Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the President’s aides have pushed back on any idea that he won’t run again, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying just last week that “the President intends to run in 2024.” But an overwhelming number – 75% – of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters would like to see someone other than Biden be the party’s nominee in the 2024 election, according to a CNN poll out last month.

33,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/media/alex-jones-sandy-hook-trial/,"The dishonesty of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was spotlighted in a Texas court on Wednesday as a lawyer for a pair of Sandy Hook parents cross-examined the Infowars founder and fact-checked his answers in real-time. The jury hearing the case will determine how much Jones will have to pay the parents, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, who won a default judgement against him earlier this year. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis has asked the jury to award $150 million in damages. Jones, who was the sole witness for the defense during the trial, did not fare well Wednesday as he was cross-examined by the plaintiffs’ attorney, Mark Bankston. In a remarkable moment, Bankston disclosed to Jones and the court that he had recently acquired evidence proving Jones had lied when he claimed during the discovery process that he had never texted about the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting.  Bankston said that Jones’ attorney had, in an apparent mishap, sent him two years of cell phone records that included every text message Jones had sent.  The cell phone records, Bankston said, showed that Jones had in fact texted about the Sandy Hook shooting.  “That is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn’t have text messages about Sandy Hook,” Bankston said.  Bankston showed Jones a text message exchange he had about Sandy Hook. But Jones testified that he had “never seen these text messages.” When reminded Jones had testified under oath that he had searched his phone during the discovery phase of the trial and could not locate messages about Sandy Hook, Jones insisted he “did not lie.” Jones baselessly said in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 26 people were killed, that the incident was staged. Facing lawsuits, Jones has since acknowledged the shooting occurred. Jones said in a 2019 sworn deposition that a “form of psychosis” caused him at the time to believe it was staged. And in court on Wednesday, Jones said that he does believe the Sandy Hook shooting happened, saying it was “100% real.” In another notable moment during cross-examination Wednesday, Jones was asked whether he had connected Maya Guerra Gamble, the judge overseeing the trial, to pedophilia and human trafficking.  When Jones denied having done so, Bankston played video for the court of an Infowars video which did just that. In the video, Jones attacked Gamble’s prior work for Child Protective Services by claiming the agency had been “exposed” for “working for pedophiles.”  Gamble, whose office did not respond to an earlier request for comment about the fact Infowars has been attacking her in such terms, laughed when she saw a screengrab from the video in court on Wednesday. “The person on the left of this image is our judge, correct?” Bankston asked Jones. Jones replied that it was. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Tuesday that they intend to ask for sanctions against Jones for being dishonest on the stand. And Gamble on Tuesday had also admonished Jones for having violated his oath to tell the truth twice. “You are already under oath to tell the truth,” Gamble said Tuesday. “You’ve already violated that oath twice today, in just those two examples. It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify. Yet here I am again.” “This is not your show,” Gamble added to him Wednesday.    After Jones finished testifying Wednesday, the defense rested its case and closing arguments got underway.  The jury could potentially decide how much it will award in damages to the Sandy Hook parents as early as this week.  The current trial is the first of three that will determine how much Jones will have to pay multiple Sandy Hook families who sued him and won default judgments.

429,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/parents-lawsuit-transgender-child-tennessee/,"The parents of a third-grade transgender child in Tennessee filed a lawsuit in federal court this week, challenging a state law that prohibits transgender students, employees, and teachers from access to the bathroom, locker rooms and other sex-segregated facilities consistent with their gender identity.  The lawsuit was filed against the Williamson County Board of Education, and the Tennessee Department of Education in the District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff identified as D.H. is a transgender girl who started third grade this week. D.H. was assigned male at birth and since age six has identified as a girl.  According to the lawsuit, the parents approached their child’s school to discuss the transition. “When A.H. and E.H. met with the Elementary School about how to support D.H. in her social transitioning, the Elementary School initially agreed to use “she/her” pronouns, but did not want to make a public announcement to students,” the lawsuit states.   After the discussion, the 2021 School Facilities Law was signed by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, and went into effect.  Under Tennessee’s bathroom law, a person can seek monetary damages if school officials allow a transgender person into a bathroom or locker room that does not correspond with their gender assigned at birth when others are present. The law also allows them to sue if they are required to stay in the same sleeping quarters with someone assigned the opposite gender at birth who is not a family member. “At that time, D.H.’s parents made multiple attempts to speak with various school administrators about D.H.’s transition and how the Elementary School could best support D.H. By that time, however, the Elementary School administration could not provide D.H. with the support she needed to complete her social transition as the School Facilities Law had come into full effect, preventing D.H. from using the restrooms corresponding with her gender identity, unlike the rest of her non-transgender classmates,” the lawsuit states.   After the law was enacted, D.H.’s school accommodated the child by letting her use one of four single-occupancy restrooms, which the lawsuit claims “reinforce the differential treatment” of D.H. “By singling out transgender students for disfavored treatment and explicitly writing discrimination against transgender people into State law, the School Facilities Law violates the most basic guarantees of equal protection under the U.S. Constitution and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,” the suit claims.    The defendants are named as Williamson County Board of Education; Jason Golden, director of Williamson County Schools; the Tennessee Department of Education and Penny Schwinn, Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Education.    CNN has reached out to the attorneys representing D.H. and her parents.    CNN has also reached out to Williamson County Schools and the Tennessee Department of Education whose spokespeople declined to comment on pending litigation. CNN has not received comment from its requests to all members of the Williamson County School Board, County Schools Director Jason Golden, or state education director Penny Schwinn.

9,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/joe-biden-counter-terrorism/,"The United States killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike, President Joe Biden said Monday in a speech from the White House. “I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield, once and for all,” Biden said.  Zawahiri, who just turned 71 years old, had remained a visible international symbol of the group, 11 years after the US killed Osama bin Laden. At one point, he acted as bin Laden’s personal physician. Zawahiri was sheltering in downtown Kabul to reunite with his family, Biden said, and was killed in what a senior administration official described as “a precise tailored airstrike” using two Hellfire missiles. The drone strike was conducted at 9:48 p.m. ET on Saturday was authorized by Biden following weeks of meetings with his Cabinet and key advisers, the official said on Monday, adding that no American personnel were on the ground in Kabul at the time of the strike. Senior Haqqani Taliban figures were aware of Zawahiri’s presence in the area, the official said, in “clear violation of the Doha agreement,” and even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday’s successful strike, restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children, who were intentionally not targeted during the strike and remained unharmed. The US did not alert Taliban officials ahead of Saturday’s strike. In a series of tweets, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, “An air strike was carried out on a residential house in Sherpur area of Kabul city on July 31.” He said, “The nature of the incident was not apparent at first” but the security and intelligence services of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and “initial findings determined that the strike was carried out by an American drone.” The tweets by Mujahid came out prior to CNN reporting Zawahiri’s death. Mujahid said the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan “strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.” ‘Justice has been delivered’ Biden, who was kept abreast of the strike against Zawahiri as he isolated with a rebound case of Covid-19, spoke outdoors Monday from the Blue Room Balcony at the White House.  Zawahiri, Biden said, “was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11, one of the most responsible for the attacks that murdered 2,977 people on American soil. For decades, he was the mastermind of attacks against Americans.” “Now, justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer,” he continued. “The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm. We make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.”  The President said the precision strike targeting was the result of the “extraordinary persistence and skill” of the nation’s intelligence community. “Our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year – he moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family,” Biden said. The strike comes one year after Biden ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, prompting Taliban forces to rapidly seize control of the nation. Biden said on Monday that when he withdrew US troops from the country, he “made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm, and I made a promise to the American people, that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond. We’ve done just that.”  Biden pledged that Zawahiri “will never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven, because he is gone and we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”  The President concluded by expressing gratitude to US intelligence and counterterrorism communities, saying that he hopes Zawahiri’s death will bring some measure of closure to the friends and families of 9/11 victims.  “To those who continue to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act – and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe,” he concluded.  Embarrassment for Taliban A senior counterterrorism analyst told CNN that it would have been impossible for Zawahiri to be in Kabul without the invitation and acquiescence of at least a small number of Taliban, whether from the Haqqani network or another part of the group. The analyst said that this strike was embarrassing for the Taliban as they had claimed there were no foreign fighters in Afghanistan and no al Qaeda. He added that recent statements from Zawahiri had suggested the al Qaeda leader was feeling more relaxed. The statements had referred to more recent events, the analyst said, adding this potentially revealed a complacency that may have led to the successful strike. The issue now arises as to who will be Zawahiri’s successor. The current al Qaeda No. 2, Saif al Adel, is thought to have been in Iran, according to United Nations reports. The analyst said that this raised an urgent issue for the Iranians who now have to choose between expelling the new al Qaeda leader or harboring him. A former official in the Afghan government with an intimate grasp of counterterrorism said that he had heard al Adel had already left Iran for Afghanistan. Close ally of bin Laden Zawahiri comes from a distinguished Egyptian family, according to the New York Times. His grandfather, Rabia’a al-Zawahiri, was an imam at al-Azhar University in Cairo. His great-uncle, Abdel Rahman Azzam, was the first secretary of the Arab League. He eventually helped to mastermind the deadliest terror attack on American soil, when hijackers turned US airliners into missiles.  “Those 19 brothers who went out and gave their souls to Allah almighty, God almighty has granted them this victory we are enjoying now,” al-Zawahiri said in a videotaped message released in April 2002.  It was the first of many taunting messages the terrorist – who became al Qaeda’s leader after US forces killed bin Laden in 2011 – would send out over the years, urging militants to continue the fight against America and chiding US leaders.  Zawahiri was constantly on the move once the US-led invasion of Afghanistan began after the September 11, 2001, attacks. At one point, he narrowly escaped a US onslaught in the rugged, mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, an attack that left his wife and children dead.  He made his public debut as a Muslim militant when he was in prison for his involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.  “We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? Who are we?” he said in a jailhouse interview.  By that time, al-Zawahiri, a young doctor, was already a committed terrorist who conspired to overthrow the Egyptian government for years and sought to replace it with fundamentalist Islamic rule. He proudly endorsed Sadat’s assassination after the Egyptian leader made peace with Israel.  He spent three years in prison after Sadat’s assassination and claimed he was tortured while in detention. After his release, he made his way to Pakistan, where he treated wounded mujahadeen fighters who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.  That was when he met bin Laden and found a common cause.  “We are working with brother bin Laden,” he said in announcing the merger of his terror group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, with al Qaeda in May 1998. “We know him since more than 10 years now. We fought with him here in Afghanistan.”  Together, the two terror leaders signed a fatwa, or declaration: “The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim.”  Mastermind of 9/11 The attacks against the US and its facilities began weeks later, with the suicide bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 5,000 others. Zawahiri and bin Laden gloated after they escaped a US cruise missile attack in Afghanistan that had been launched in retaliation.  Then, there was the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, when suicide bombers on a dinghy detonated their boat, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39 others.  The culmination of Zawahiri’s terror plotting came on September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, headed for Washington, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back.  Since then, al-Zawahiri raised his public profile, appearing on numerous video and audiotapes to urge Muslims to join the jihad against the United States and its allies. Some of his tapes were followed closely by terrorist attacks.  In May 2003, for instance, almost simultaneous suicide bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, killed 23 people, including nine Americans, days after a tape thought to contain Zawahiri’s voice was released.  The US State Department had offered a reward of up to $25 million for information leading directly to his capture. A June 2021 United Nations report suggested he was located somewhere in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that he may have been too frail to be featured in propaganda. 9/11 families group expresses gratitude but calls on Biden to hold Saudis accountable Terry Strada, the chair of 9/11 Families United – a coalition of survivors and families of victims of the September, 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – expressed gratitude for the strike, but called on the President to hold the Saudi Arabian government accountable for alleged government complicity in the attacks.  The group has criticized the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour, which began its third competition at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster at the end of July – some 50 miles from Ground Zero in Manhattan.  “I am deeply grateful for the commitment of intelligence agencies and our brave military’s dedication and sacrifices made in removing such evil from our lives. But, in order to achieve full accountability for the murder of thousands on Sept. 11, 2001, President Biden must also hold responsible the Saudi paymasters who bankrolled the Attacks,” Strada said in a statement.  “The financiers are not being targeted by drones, they are being met with fist pumps and hosted at golf clubs. If we’re going to be serious about accountability, we must hold EVERYONE accountable,” Strada added – appearing to reference the President’s controversial gesture with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

22,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/kyrsten-sinema-democrats-big-week-for-biden-presidency/,"Democrats this week have the chance to validate their monopoly on political power in Washington, create a legacy of true significance for President Joe Biden and even boost their hopes in daunting midterm elections in three months. But first they must push a back-from-the-dead climate and health care initiative through the Senate using their tiny majority, notably by locking in the crucial vote of moderate Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who has yet to sign off on a bill that may not save Democrats in November but may at least give them a big new win to run on. Tensions are, meanwhile, soaring between the parties, especially over a Republican blockade of a bill that would fund health care for veterans sickened by exposure to burn pits during service in America’s foreign wars. The move opened up the GOP to accusations of cruelty – and, for once, Republican leader Mitch McConnell has looked outmaneuvered. The opening on climate did not exist a week ago. But the stunning deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and holdout moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin created possibilities most of the party thought were gone. Democrats, who have suffered as Biden’s legislative agenda repeatedly stalled, will be desperate to pass the bill this week before a Senate recess slows its momentum. But there remains at least one huge question mark – the vote of Sinema, whose support is just as critical as Manchin’s in the 50-50 Senate. Like Manchin, she has opposed dismantling the Senate filibuster to pass other Democratic priority bills. She did help remodel Biden’s larger Build Back Better bill before Manchin blocked it last year. But now there are questions over whether she will back tax changes affecting private equity investors in the Manchin-Schumer compromise. As the 50th Democrat needed to pass the measure with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote, Sinema has huge leverage to seek changes that threaten the bill’s fragile foundation, and she has so far avoided giving her verdict on the deal. Manchin suggested on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that he hadn’t spoken to Sinema about the package since he agreed on it with Schumer. But he paid tribute to his Arizona colleague and her previous work on reducing prescription drugs prices – a goal that is included in the new draft law.  “When she looks at the bill and sees the whole spectrum of what we’re doing and all of the energy we’re bringing in – all of the reduction of prices and fighting inflation by bringing prices down, by having more energy – hopefully, she will be positive about it,” Manchin said. “But she will make her decision. And I respect that.” Manchin wields his power Manchin, blanketing Sunday TV talk shows, demonstrated his power at the fulcrum of a closely divided Senate as he put his spin on the legislation – always with an eye on voters back home in a deeply red state. Once again, Manchin has succeeded in putting his state, one of the poorest and smallest in the nation, at the center of Washington policy making.  He has also used his power to champion centrism at a time when both parties seem to be moving toward their most radical base supporters. After repeatedly infuriating Democrats by thwarting Biden’s agenda, he’s now disappointing Republicans who had hoped he would maintain his opposition. On Sunday, Manchin insisted his package would lower inflation, expand domestic energy production, ensure certain corporations pay their fair tax share, and would benefit Americans by cutting prescription drugs costs for Medicare patients. The measure would also spend nearly $370 billion on fighting climate change and developing a new green energy economy, reviving efforts that had seemed doomed just weeks ago by opposition from the coal-state senator. If the bill does pass the Senate and later makes it through the House, it would instantly transform Biden into the President who made the greatest commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and would enshrine his global leadership of the effort to stave off the most disastrous future effects of climate change. It comes as extreme weather events – from drought in the American West to flooding in Kentucky that has killed at least 28 people – are ravaging the US.  The climate funding is not the only key Democratic priority in the bill. The Manchin-Schumer bill, now rebranded as the “Inflation Reduction Act,” includes extended Affordable Care Act subsidies that would also cement another key reform wrought by Democratic power in the 21st century – Obamacare. These twin achievements could go some way to changing perceptions of the Biden presidency – which, despite some successes, including a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package and a rare bipartisan infrastructure law – has seen key agenda items like voting rights and police reform founder in the Senate.  While the passage of the bill could come too late to save Democrats from the painful punch of high inflation in midterm elections in November, it might juice turnout of progressives demoralized by the failure to do more with the party’s thin control of Washington power. Taken together with the mobilization of liberals following the conservative Supreme Court’s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion, and majority public support for gun restrictions in the wake of a string of mass shootings, Democrats would at least have a platform to run on in November if they can succeed in weaving a coherent narrative on their achievements.  While Republican strategists believe that the House is already heading toward them, according to new CNN reporting over the weekend, a late spike in Democratic enthusiasm could spur the hopes of party leaders who believe the Senate is not a lost cause – especially against a clutch of candidates in ex-President Donald Trump’s image who could scare off suburban voters.  GOP mobilizes to prevent Democratic win  Manchin explained on Sunday that he understood the invective hurled his way by many Democrats, and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, after he derailed the previous “Build Back Better” plan over his belief that it would fuel already soaring inflation. He said that he hoped the new measure would pass by the end of this week, when the Senate is due to break for an August recess.  The timetable remains a high wire act – just one case of Covid-19 among Democratic senators, for example, could fracture the party’s majority since all Republicans are expected to be against it. There have been several recent positive tests among senators that have sent them into isolation, including Manchin.  In defending his deal with Schumer, the West Virginia senator said that “in normal times,” Republicans would support the bill, since it would pay down the deficit, accelerate permitting for oil and gas drilling and increase energy production – all of which the GOP has previously been on record supporting. But GOP senators are mobilizing to try to prevent passage of the bill, which would represent a victory for Biden and the Democrats before the midterms. “It really looks to me like Joe Manchin has been taken to the cleaners,” Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey told Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “Look, this bill, the corporate tax increase, is going to slow down growth, probably exacerbate a recession that we’re probably already in,” said Toomey, who’s retiring. He argued that prescription drug price controls would slow development of life-saving medicines and that the bill would subsidize “wealthy people buying Teslas.” Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said on ABC News’ “This Week” that another multi-billion dollar spending bill could inject “an incredible amount of uncertainty” into the economy just as it entered a recession.  Debate is raging in Washington on that last point following the release of an official report last week showing a second straight quarter of negative growth. The White House insists that given strong job growth, the economy is not in a classic contraction. In practical terms, however, the inside-the-Beltway semantics make little difference to Americans confronted by grocery bills that are far more expensive than a year ago, even if the prices at the pump have eased somewhat in recent weeks. Republicans accused of ‘cruelty’ over veterans’ health care The battle over the climate and health care bill will take place in parallel this week with a fierce controversy over the GOP blockage of a bill that would provide health care to veterans exposed to toxic fumes from burn pits, which were used to incinerate waste at military installations during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Activists, including comedian Jon Stewart, have accused the GOP of “cruelty” after some senators who voted for a previous version of the bill voted not to advance this one. Republicans, meanwhile, accuse Democrats of inserting new spending and complain that their amendments were not included. Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough said on “State of the Union” that a Toomey amendment would put a “year-on-year” cap on what the department can spend on veterans exposed to burn pits and would lead to “rationing of care.”  Biden, in a FaceTime call from isolation after he registered another positive Covid-19 test on Saturday, promised protesters at the Capitol that he’d fight for the legislation “as long as I have a breath in me.” Toomey told Tapper, however, that he had long raised opposition to the measure since he wanted funding for burn pit care included in year-on-year appropriations rather than in the mandatory spending column. He said the current legislation would allow Democrats to divert $400 billion to other purposes. And he denied claims that Republicans are holding up the bill to prevent Democrats from scoring another win, following the closing of the Manchin-Schumer deal, as “absurd and dishonest.”  However, the sight of Republicans voting against veterans’ health care – whatever the intricate details of the case – threatens to further an impression that the party is becoming more extreme. And it also takes the focus off the key issues that are most likely to sway the midterm elections in the GOP’s favor, including inflation, gasoline prices and Biden’s low approval rating.",Bill

363,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/five-things-august-2-trnd/,"A glimmer of relief is emerging at the checkout aisle: the return of discounts. Major retailers – including Walmart, Best Buy and Target – stocked up on merchandise months ago to prepare for supply chain shortages. But now, with extra goods sitting on their shelves, many stores are increasing promotions and lowering prices to entice inflation-weary shoppers.  Here’s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Al Qaeda The US killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike, President Joe Biden said Monday in a speech from the White House. Zawahiri, the world’s most wanted terrorist and one of the masterminds of the 9/11 terror attacks, was killed after months of highly secret planning by Biden and a tight circle of his senior advisers. Throughout the complex effort to plan the strike, Biden repeatedly tasked his officials with ensuring that civilians – including members of Zawahiri’s family – were not killed. None were, according to the White House. “People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer,” Biden said. The moment was a political win for the President, as he emphasized the US “will always do what is necessary” to ensure the security of Americans. 2. Taiwan House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to visit Taiwan as part of her tour of Asia, according to a senior Taiwanese government official and a US official, despite warnings from Biden administration officials who are worried about China’s response to such a high-profile visit. The stop – a first for a US House speaker in 25 years – comes at a time when US-China relations are strained. US Defense Department officials are now working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe. While the expected stop in Taiwan is not currently on Pelosi’s itinerary, China has warned against the “egregious political impact” of the planned visit to the self-governing island that China claims as a part of its territory. Chinese officials have also reiterated that its military “won’t sit by idly” if Beijing feels its “sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being threatened. 3. Extreme weather Extreme weather has thrashed parts of the US over the past week – one of the many signals that climate change is here now, scientists say. Recovery efforts are underway after two devastating floods, one in Kentucky and another in Missouri. The death toll in Kentucky rose to 37 on Monday and the governor said hundreds remain unaccounted for. Missouri is also trying to recover after St. Louis was drenched with 9 inches of rain last week, setting the city’s highest daily rainfall total since 1915. Meanwhile, a severe drought has fueled California’s largest wildfire of the year so far – the McKinney Fire – which burned so hot that massive pyrocumulus clouds erupted into the atmosphere. Climate scientists say more of these extremes are expected as the planet continues to warm. The biggest single contributor to the climate crisis is fossil fuels, but many countries are delaying their phaseout plans in response to the energy crunch caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   4. Ukraine The US announced an additional $550 million security assistance package for Ukraine on Monday to “meet Ukraine’s critical security and defense needs,” according to a statement from the Pentagon. The assistance, which is being drawn from US stockpiles, includes 75,000 rounds of artillery ammunition and an undisclosed amount of additional ammunition for advanced rocket systems to help defend Ukraine. The aid comes as the Ukrainian military has repelled Russian advances in the eastern Donetsk region near the strategically important city of Bakhmut. However, Russian shelling has intensified in the city of Mykolaiv, where Russian forces hit a university dorm overnight, Ukrainian officials said. Recent attacks in this area are being described by the city’s mayor as the “strongest” since the start of the war.  5. Uvalde More than a dozen major news organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Texas Department of Public Safety to obtain public records relating to the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde, Texas. The coalition includes CNN, the Texas Tribune, and many of the state and the country’s biggest news outlets. The news organizations have been fighting for weeks to obtain information on behalf of the public amid falsehoods and stonewalling from Texas officials in the aftermath of the mass shooting. Separately, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott met privately with families in Uvalde on Monday to discuss school safety. But some expressed skepticism regarding the governor’s visit to the town, where questions and frustrations remain over the official response to the May 24 massacre that left 19 students and two teachers dead.

TODAY’S NUMBER 7 years That’s how long a man was sentenced to serve in prison on Monday for participating in the Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. The rioter, Guy Reffitt, received the longest insurrection-related sentence to date for bringing a gun to the US Capitol and threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Reffitt, a recruiter for a right-wing militia, was the first Capitol rioter to go to trial rather than take a plea agreement. TODAY’S QUOTE “Anyone who has a recalled product in his or her possession should dispose of it immediately or return it to the place of purchase for a refund.” – A beverage recall issued by food company Lyons Magnus, warning 53 drink products should be thrown out or returned due to possible Cronobacter bacterial contamination. The voluntary recall includes certain lots of beverages, liquid coffee, pediatric nutritional supplements, protein shakes, nutritional shakes and thickened liquids.

221,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/investing/stocks-week-ahead/,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. If you’re reading this, it means you’ve survived the busiest week of the summer. Congratulations.  The last week of July came with an overwhelming confluence of economic data, earnings reports, Federal Reserve announcements and spending deals in Congress. The impact of these past seven days will reverberate for the next several weeks around the abandoned halls of Wall Street and Washington DC as politicos and investors retreat to the Hamptons or Martha’s Vineyard or wherever they summer.  Are we in a recession? It’s hard to say, but hopefully by September the knowledge we gleaned during this treacherous week will be fully absorbed, and our understanding of the US economy will be more clear.  So what are we working with here? Let’s recap. That’s a lot to digest. Especially in a very persistent heat wave. Unfortunately, we do have another data-heavy week before we get a break. Earnings continue next week with Starbucks\n            \n                (SBUX), Uber\n            \n                (UBER) and Airbnb reporting. We also expect the release of some important economic data: JOLTs (job openings) unemployment rates, and PMI, a key indicator of US economic activity, are all headed our way.  So hold off on the swimsuits and SPF for now. Or don’t, and bring the beach to your desk. Vacation is a state of mind right?   Ducati takes on the world  My CNN colleague Jonathan Hawkins recently had the opportunity to sit down with Ducati CEO Claudio Domenicali in Misano, Italy, where World Ducati Week drew roughly 80,000 avid fans and owners across three days. The company, which is owned by Volkswagen, announced Friday that it brought in record revenue of €542 million ($552 million) in the first half of 2022 and boosted operating profits by about 15%. But the chief of Ducati described a difficult mix of business conditions that have made it harder to meet a surge in demand for bikes. Supply chain issues since the pandemic have been a “complete nightmare,” Domenicali said. “It’s been a very complicated mix of everything,” he said, noting that the time it takes to get a container from Asia to Europe has doubled, while closures in China have made it tough to secure necessary parts. Yet he pushed back on the idea that supply chains should become more localized, noting the pitfalls of reversing decades of globalization. “When you do business for the whole world, you stay more connected,” Domenicali said. Amid the uncertainty, the company does have an advantage. The cheap euro, which fell to parity with the US dollar in July for the first time in two decades, benefits exporters like Ducati, since it makes their goods cheaper for foreign customers. “It’s a help,” Domenicali said, not a problem. And he said the company, one of Italy’s best-known brands, hasn’t been shaken by the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government. Ducati has gotten used to executing its long-term plans without counting on the government, according to Domenicali.

623,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/white-house-lightning-strike/,"Three people are dead and one is injured following a lightning strike across the street from the White House Thursday night. James Mueller, 76, and Donna Mueller, 75, died from injuries following the lightning strike in Lafayette Park near the White House Thursday night, a DC Metropolitan Police spokesperson confirmed. The couple was visiting from Wisconsin. Friday afternoon, police said a 29-year-old man died from his injuries. His name is being withheld pending family notification. The condition of the other person who was injured has not been released. The victims were riding out the storm under a tree, a law enforcement source said. The thunderstorm hit the DC region around 7 p.m. ET. “We are saddened by the tragic loss of life after the lightning strike in Lafayette Park,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Friday. “Our hearts are with the families who lost loved ones, and we are praying for those still fighting for their lives.” The three people killed were the 10th, 11th and 12th killed by lightning so far this year in the United States, according to John Jensenius, an expert at the National Lightning Safety Council. The US averages 16 lightning deaths per year through August 4 based on data for the past 10 years, Jensenius said Friday evening. He also noted that this week’s fatalities were the first in Washington since May 17, 1991 when one was killed and 10 others injured when lightning struck a tree at a lacrosse game. “This incident underscores the need for people to get to a safe place any time a thunderstorm is in the area. Even a distant rumble of thunder should serve as a warning to get inside a substantial building or hard-topped metal immediately,” Jensenius wrote. “The incident also underscores the danger of sheltering under a tree, as images from the scene show victims near a tall tree. Lightning tends to strike the tallest object in the immediate area, which is often a tree.” This story has been updated with additional information.

333,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/entertainment/aj-mclean-backstreet-boys/,"Editor’s Note: You can read a Spanish version of this interview on CNNE.com. For Backstreet Boys’ AJ McLean, pursuing a solo career doesn’t mean he has to step away from the band with which he’s performed for almost 30 years.  “Each thing goes hand in hand. If I have a successful album, it only reflects on my success with the group, where I started and where I will always return to,” McLean told CNN en Español via Zoom. The music industry has witnessed time and again how bands like *NSYNC or One Direction have gone their separate ways for good after one or more members pursue their own endeavors, breaking hearts worldwide. But McLean said when it comes to BSB, going strong since 1993, “even if I have the most successful period solo, I’m still not going anywhere.”  “That is my home,” he said. “That is where I belong. But I don’t see there being a problem with having the best of both worlds.” This unity and knowing they have each other’s back has given them the confidence to explore other avenues. Kevin Richardson, who left the group for six years period from 2006-2012, has done Broadway; Brian Littrell did a Christian album and Howie Dorough released a children’s record. Meanwhile, Nick Carter has been in movies, released multiple solo albums and teamed up with Jordan Knight from the New Kids on the Block for their duo Nick & Knight. “The number one priority amongst the five of us is Backstreet Boys, which is at the epicenter,” he said. “And, some of us, not all of us, are aspiring to do things outside of the group.” Earlier this month, McLean released “Smoke,” the first single of his upcoming album “Sex and Bodies.”  The song draws inspiration from Prince and George Michael and incorporates funk falsettos that contrast with the singer’s signature raspy voice. The song celebrates love and how a relationship should feel “as easy as blowing smoke,” McLean said.  “No pun intended, but I lit a cigarette and I was like, you know, sometimes relationships can be as easy as blowing smoke,” he said. “Like, that’s how easy it is if this person is the one. That’s kind of what inspired the title.” “Sex and Bodies” will be McLean’s second solo album and is set to release in early 2023. “I keep saying it’s an incredible record. I’m so proud of it. And even though ‘Smoke’ is an amazing record, it’s still not the best record on the album.” McLean is currently touring the United States with the Backstreet Boys. The successful second leg of the DNA World Tour is showing how strong the Backstreet Boys are after three decades. “The rest of the tour is sold out. Europe is sold out. Latin America is sold out,” McLean said. “It’s a testament to each other. It’s a testament to our fans, and it’s a testament to the music.”  He added: “I’m honored to say that I’m a Backstreet Boy, and I’m proud to be a Backstreet Boy in 2022.”",Nick Carter;Nick Carter;Las Vegas;Howie Dorough;Howie Dorough;Kevin Richardson;Kevin Richardson;Nick Knight;Jordan Knight;George Michael;Brian Littrell;Brian Littrell,Cnn;Cnn;United States,"TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_LATIN,2733;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,430;WB_2670_JOBS,121;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,121;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,121;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,121;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,121;KILL,1598;KILL,2275;TAX_FNCACT_KNIGHT,1247;TAX_FNCACT_KNIGHT,1304;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,1917;TAX_RELIGION_CHRISTIAN,1091;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHRISTIAN,1091;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,1840;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,1408;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,22;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,22;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1133;",America;Nevada;Spanish;United States
334,https://us.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/georgia-brianna-grier-body-camera-footage-reaj/,"Georgia authorities released body camera footage Friday of an incident from earlier this month where a mother experiencing what her family called a mental health crisis died due to a fatal injury while in police custody.  Brianna Grier, 28, was experiencing a mental health episode on July 15 when her mother called police to assist with the matter, civil rights attorney Ben Crump said at a news conference Friday.   Crump, who is representing the Grier family, said Grier had a history of mental health crises and the family had called police several times in the past.   “When they used to come out to the house they’d call an ambulance service,” Grier’s father Marvin Grier said. “The ambulance service would come out and they would take her to the hospital to get some help.”   “But this time they only called the police, and the police didn’t bring the ambulance with them, even though, Ms. Mary (Brianna’s mom) clearly stated she was having an episode,” Crump explained.   Crump said Hancock County Sheriff’s deputies came into the home, handcuffed Grier and placed her in the back of a patrol car to take her into custody for allegedly resisting arrest.   In body camera video released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Grier asks deputies to give her a breathalyzer test and repeatedly tells officers she is not drunk. According to a time stamp on the video, Grier was placed in the patrol car shortly before 1 a.m. on July 15.  Grier then yells to officers saying she’s going to hang herself if she is placed in the car. They proceed to place her in handcuffs and attempt to place her in a squad car but when she resists further, an officer is seen unholstering his taser.    When Grier sees this, she yells at officers saying they can tase her, and that she doesn’t care. The officer replies, saying he’s not going to tase her.   The video shows the officer putting the Taser away and then walking away from the rear driver’s side door. When the officer returns, he is seen lifting Grier off the ground and putting her in the back seat of the patrol car.   The body camera video fails to show if officers opened, closed or had any interaction with the rear passenger side door, but an officer is heard asking another officer if the door is closed.   GBI investigators concluded Wednesday that “the rear passenger side door of the patrol car, near where Grier was sitting, was never closed,” according to a news release.   Less than a minute later, after the officers drive away from the Grier family home, the video shows an officer suddenly stop his vehicle and get out.   Once out of the car, the officer locates Grier laying on the side of the road, face down. Grier doesn’t respond to the officer, who is tapping her side and saying her name. The officer then radios to an oncoming patrol car that is behind him that they’re going to need an ambulance.   The footage does not show the moment Grier falls out of the vehicle but does show her laying face first on the ground and the rear passenger car door open.   The second officer says that Grier is still breathing. Grier never responds to the officers calling her name after falling out of the patrol vehicle. The video ends with Grier on the ground while police wait for paramedics.  Crump alleges that police didn’t secure Grier in a seatbelt while she was handcuffed in the back of the police car and as a result, when the vehicle started moving, she somehow fell out of the car, landed on her head, cracked her skull and then went into a coma for six days before dying because of her injuries.  Investigators reviewed multiple body camera videos, conducted numerous interviews and conducted “mechanical tests on the patrol car” to determine “if there were possible mechanical malfunctions” to the vehicle, the GBI statement reads.  The GBI news release notes that two deputies were trying to get her into the back of the patrol car after she was arrested and put in handcuffs.   Grier told the deputies she was going to hurt herself and was on the ground refusing to get into the patrol car, according to the release.   The GBI statement said the two deputies and Grier, who was on the ground, “were at the rear driver’s side door of the patrol car” when “one of the deputies walked around and opened the rear passenger side door.” The same deputy quickly returned to the rear driver’s side door, the GBI statement says, and both deputies put Grier into the back of the patrol car.   Deputies closed the rear driver’s side door and, according to the GBI statement, “The investigation shows that the deputy thought he closed the rear passenger side door.”  In the video, an officer can be seen picking Grier up and placing her in the car through the driver’s side rear door.  Off camera, one of the officers is heard asking if the door on the other side is closed, to which the other officer replies yes.   Deputies left the scene of the incident and drove a short distance before Grier fell out of the moving car, according to the statement.   CNN has reached out to the Hancock County Sheriff’s Department for comment but did not immediately hear back.  “I just don’t understand why they couldn’t put her in a seat belt why they violated so many policies to prevent anything like this from happening,” Crump said.  “We loved her regardless, unconditionally. Now we got to raise these kids and tell them a story, and I’m not planning on telling no lie,” Marvin Greer told reporters Friday. “I want to tell the truth, so it won’t happen to nobody else.” CNN’s Zenebou Syllaand and Camila Moreno-Lizarazo contributed to this report.",Marvin Grier;Brianna Grier;Brianna Grier;Ben Crump;Ben Crump;Marvin Greer;Zenebou Syllaand;Mary Brianna,Georgia Bureau Of Investigation;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_DEPUTY,4377;TAX_FNCACT_DEPUTY,4628;MEDIA_MSM,5506;TAX_DISEASE_COMA,3599;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1098;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1402;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1522;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1600;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2046;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2331;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2586;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2789;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2991;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3452;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3534;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3775;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3977;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4132;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4286;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4506;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4757;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5030;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1226;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,4606;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1226;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4606;WB_840_JUSTICE,1226;WB_840_JUSTICE,4606;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1226;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,4606;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1226;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,4606;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1226;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,4606;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1226;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,4606;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,658;USPEC_POLICY1,5283;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,752;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,752;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,1010;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,5127;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,3452;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,20;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,20;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,20;WB_1428_INJURY,196;SOC_GENERALCRIME,4000;GENERAL_HEALTH,162;GENERAL_HEALTH,277;GENERAL_HEALTH,504;MEDICAL,162;MEDICAL,277;MEDICAL,504;TAX_FNCACT_PARAMEDICS,3227;TRIAL,369;TRIAL,3239;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,369;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3239;KILL,174;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,174;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,360;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,360;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,1308;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,1461;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,1719;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,2097;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,2460;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,3096;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,4825;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1308;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1461;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1719;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,2097;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,2460;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,3096;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,4825;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1919;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,4258;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,4541;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,4776;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,635;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,691;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,852;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2847;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,635;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,691;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,852;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2847;WB_1324_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SERVICES,635;WB_1324_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SERVICES,691;WB_1324_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SERVICES,852;WB_1324_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SERVICES,2847;ARREST,220;ARREST,1123;SECURITY_SERVICES,212;SECURITY_SERVICES,319;SECURITY_SERVICES,542;SECURITY_SERVICES,811;SECURITY_SERVICES,826;SECURITY_SERVICES,3207;SECURITY_SERVICES,3364;SECURITY_SERVICES,3448;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,212;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,319;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,542;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,811;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,826;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,3207;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,3364;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,3448;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,212;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,319;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,542;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,811;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,826;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3207;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3364;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3448;WB_1406_DISEASES,162;WB_1406_DISEASES,277;WB_1406_DISEASES,504;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,162;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,277;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,504;WB_1430_MENTAL_HEALTH,162;WB_1430_MENTAL_HEALTH,277;WB_1430_MENTAL_HEALTH,504;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,162;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,277;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,504;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,3642;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1640;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1782;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1855;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1947;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2184;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2216;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2527;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2600;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2694;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2751;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,3023;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,4703;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,4910;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1640;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1782;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1855;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1947;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2184;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2216;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2527;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2600;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2694;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2751;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,3023;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,4703;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,4910;",Georgia;Hancock County
575,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/derek-chauvin-correction-officers-lawsuit-settlement/,"The Ramsey County Board of Commissioners in Minnesota on Tuesday approved a nearly $1.5 million settlement agreement for eight correctional officers of color who were barred from guarding former police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020. The correctional officers claimed in a lawsuit last year that the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center prohibited them from “interacting with or guarding Chauvin,” who is White, “or going anywhere” on the floor where he was held in what the suit called a “segregation” order given by the detention center’s superintendent, Steve Lydon. CNN has reached out to the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office, which runs the detention center, for comment but has not received a response.  Chauvin was convicted in April 2021 of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He is appealing his conviction.  Chauvin earlier this year pleaded guilty to violating Floyd’s civil rights and of an unrelated civil rights violation and was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison to be served concurrently with his 22.5-year sentence on the state murder charges. Body camera and bystander video showed Chauvin kneeling on the 46-year-old Black man’s neck and back for more than nine minutes as Floyd gasped for air and told officers, “I can’t breathe.”  Attorneys for the correctional officers alleged that, as a result of Lydon’s order, all officers of color who were assigned in areas where Chauvin was held were segregated from the ex-cop and reassigned to other locations in the jail. The officers sued for alleged violations of the Minnesota Humans Rights Act. The $1.455 million settlement was approved during a meeting of Ramsey County Board of Commissioners, in the St. Paul, Minnesota, area.  The settlement agreement noted that the county “has denied and continues to deny liability.” The settlement required that the county issue a statement and apology acknowledging Lydon’s order was “discriminatory and wrong.” “On behalf of the Ramsey County Board of Commissioners and this entire organization, I extend our profound apologies today to Devin Sullivan, Mohamud Salad, Timothy Ivory, Anabel Herrera, Stanley Hafoka, Nathaniel Gomez-Haustein, Cedric Dodds and Chelsea Cox,” Ramsey County Board Chair Trista MatasCastillo said during Tuesday’s meeting, referring to the correction officers who sued.  “The actions taken by Sheriff’s Office leadership that day were more than just wrong – they were racist, heinous, highly disrespectful and completely out of line with Ramsey County’s vision and values. No one ever should have questioned your ability to perform your job based on the color of your skin,” MatasCastillo read as from a statement.  The eight officers who brought the lawsuit identify as Black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander-American and multiracial, their attorneys said.  The officers’ civil suit followed discrimination charges they filed with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights in June 2020. Shortly after the initial discrimination allegations, Lydon acknowledged he made the order but added that he reversed it shortly after. “Recognizing that the murder of George Floyd was likely to create particularly acute racialized trauma, I felt I had an immediate duty to protect and support employees who may have been traumatized and may have heightened ongoing trauma by having to deal with Chauvin,” Lydon said at the time. “Out of care and concern, and without the comfort of time, I made the decision to limit exposure to employees of color to a murder suspect who could potentially aggravate those feelings.” Lydon added, “I then met with the individuals that were working at the time and explained to them what my thought process was at the time and assured them that the decision was made out of concern for them and was in no way related to a concern regarding their professionalism or Chauvin’s safety. I realized that I had erred in judgment and issued an apology to the affected employees.” Sullivan, one of the plaintiff correctional officers, reacted to the settlement in a statement released by his attorneys. “Trust and accountability are critical to our safety as correctional officers, and Superintendent Lydon’s segregation order broke this trust,” Sullivan said. “Each of us is on our own journey toward healing from this damaging discrimination and the aftermath – and these settlements will help us open a next chapter.” Lucas J. Kaster, an attorney for the correctional officers, said the courage of his clients “cannot be overstated.” “During an unprecedented time in our community, the officers took the bold action to step forward and speak out against the segregation and racism they experienced,” Kaster said in a statement.  “The past two years have not been easy for them, but the Board’s actions today acknowledge the harm experienced by the officers and are critical steps toward justice and accountability,” Kaster added.

259,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/senate-bill-missing-secret-service-text-messages/,"A top Senate Democrat is proposing new legislation in response to missing Secret Service text messages that would make it more difficult for the agency to deny records to the inspector general and require additional briefings to Congress. The legislation from Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, would update the Inspector General Act of 1978, making it more difficult to deny records to inspectors general across the federal government. The bill would clarify that the Privacy Act or Presidential Records Act could not be used as a basis to deny records to inspectors general, and it would state that the decision to deny an inspector general access to records could not be delegated to any director or agency head – like the director of the Secret Service, for instance. The measure would also require additional briefs to Congress by inspectors general related to audits, inspections and other matters. Murphy chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Homeland Security Committee, which has oversight jurisdiction over the Secret Service. While the legislation, titled the Secret Service Transparency and Accountability Act, is targeted to the agency, it would apply to other inspectors general across the federal government. The bill is the latest congressional response to swirling questions over missing Secret Service text messages surrounding January 6, 2021, after DHS inspector general Joseph Cuffari wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Secret Service had erased text messages he was seeking. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin of Illinois has called on the attorney general to investigate the missing text messages. There are also questions about missing text messages related to other federal agencies, including from top DHS officials and phones being wiped in the Defense Department, as CNN first reported Tuesday. Questions have also emerged over Cufffari’s handling of the matter, as CNN reported the inspector general’s office was told in May 2021 there was an issue with the agency’s phone data migration and messages may have been lost. Two top House Democrats, Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Carolyn Maloney of New York, have called on Cuffari to hand off his investigation to another inspector general. Murphy’s legislation is focused on how the messages failed to be handed over in the first place. He said in a statement to CNN that it’s clear the Secret Service “tried to impede the inspector general’s investigation into the events of January 6 by withholding records and ultimately erasing text messages.” “This legislation would prevent the Secret Service from undermining the work of the agency watchdog, and stop them from keeping the American people in the dark about things they deserve to know,” Murphy said. CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for response to Murphy’s legislation and has not yet received a response. The Secret Service has argued that it has cooperated with the DHS inspector general’s investigation, and that the messages were deleted as part of a previously planned phone data migration in January 2021. A congressional aide said that Murphy hoped to get the legislation added to the Senate’s package of appropriations bills that’s likely to be taken up later in the year.

196,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/weather/drought-map-northeast-texas-climate/,"More than 50% of the country was in some level of drought for the fourth week in a row, the US Drought Monitor reported Thursday, as the combination of extreme heat and low rainfall is drawing the moisture out of plants and soil. And no region of the country has been spared.  The West and California remains engulfed in a multi-year megadrought. But even in the Northeast, a severe “flash drought” – one that comes on rapidly – has intensified and expanded from Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts into New Hampshire and Maine.  Yet even as drought is increasingly worrying in the Northeast, Midwest and South, waves of extreme rainfall are menacing parts of Missouri and Kentucky.  A flash flood warning was issued for the western suburbs of St. Louis early Thursday morning as rainfall rates climbed to several inches per hour, prompting fears of a repeat of last week’s flooding emergency. Scientists have warned that extremes on both ends of the spectrum will become more frequent and more intense as the planet warms. Drought expands in Northeast Drier conditions in the Northeast led to moderate and severe drought expansion in the New York City area and parts of New England, the Drought Monitor reported.   “Short-term moderate and severe drought continued to expand, especially in the New York City area, New Jersey, and New England, where rainfall was sparse and temperatures were a few degrees above normal,” the Drought Monitor said.  The worsening dry conditions have already strained water resources in the region, and officials have been warning residents to be mindful about their water usage. In mid-July, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont asked residents to dial down their water usage, in hopes of preventing “harm should the drought become prolonged.” Forecasters expect this trend to continue as “temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above normal across the Northeast and New England on Thursday afternoon, where it will feel like the upper 90s and 100s,” said CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett.  The Drought Monitor noted that water restrictions and farming impacts were becoming more common in the region as the dry conditions persisted for another week.  Texas and the West Drought also expanded in some areas of the Southern Plains, where temperatures are running warmer than normal – particularly in Texas, where the consequences have clawed into agriculture and cattle ranching.  “Drought impacts across Texas ranged from crop failure to water supply problems, in one case from a well failure,” the Drought Monitor reported. Cattle ranchers in the state told CNN the conditions have been so dire and the economic strain so large that they can no longer maintain healthy livestock, which has forced them to sell off their cows for slaughter way ahead of schedule. Income is the bottom line on these decisions, the ranchers said, as the cost of vehicles, equipment and diesel skyrockets. There was one place that saw improvement in the drought over the past week: heavy rainfall fell in parts of the Texas Panhandle east into Oklahoma, Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and portions of Tennessee, leading to an improvement in conditions across that region.

653,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/las-vegas-hotel-shooting-mirage-casino/,"A suspect has been arrested in connection with a shooting in a Las Vegas hotel room Thursday night that left one man dead and two women in critical condition, police said. Around 8:30 p.m. local time, police responded to a 911 call about a shooting in a room at the Mirage Casino and Hotel, where they found a man had already died and two women were injured, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Captain Dori Koren said in a late-night news conference. Officers and security personnel immediately began providing medical attention to the surviving victims, who were transported to the hospital in critical condition, he said. Police said Friday that a man identified as Billy Hemsley, 54, was booked at the Clark County Detention Center for one count of open murder and two counts of attempt murder. Hemsley was “involved in an argument with several family members inside of the hotel room,” according to a police statement.  “At some point during the argument, Hemsley shot the three victims and fled the area,” the statement added.  It’s unclear whether Hemsley has an attorney.   Authorities preliminarily believe the suspect shot the three victims during an altercation in the room, though the investigation is still ongoing, Koren said. “These types of incidents – any types of extreme violence that happens in our city – we take very seriously,” Koren said. “We’re confident we will solve this case.” The police captain said that officers arrived on the scene within a minute of receiving the 911 call, Koren said.

310,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/kansas-constitutional-amendment-abortion/,"Kansas on Tuesday will become the first state in the nation to let voters weigh in on abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The closely watched vote offers the first popular look at voter sentiment in the wake of the decision striking down Roe, which eliminated a federal right to abortion and sent the matter back to the states. It could also provide an indication of voter enthusiasm over the issue, which has risen to become a top focus in the midterms, particularly among Democrats. Voters regardless of political affiliation will be asked whether to amend the state constitution to remove a protected right to abortion. The procedure is currently legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas, where people from Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri have traveled for services amid Republican-led efforts to roll back abortion rights. The text of the Tuesday’s question reads: “Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother.” A majority vote for “yes” would result in the state constitution being amended to say that it “does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion.”  While such a vote would not ban abortion, it would be up to the GOP-controlled state legislature to pass laws regarding the procedure, including ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy without exceptions for rape and incest. And removing state constitutional protections would significantly curtail the ability of an individual to challenge a restrictive abortion measure. “The amendment that is on the ballot will mandate government control over our private medical decisions and ultimately pave the way for a total ban on abortion,” said Ashley All, who is part of the coalition Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, which opposes the amendment. A “no” vote would leave the state constitution unchanged, and abortions up to 22 weeks would remain legal. Lawmakers could still pass restrictive abortion laws, but the state would have to meet a higher threshold proving that it has a reason to enact the law in court. Until now, the courts have recognized a right to abortion under the state constitution. Lawmakers had passed a restrictive abortion law in 2015 that would have banned the dilation and evacuation procedure, but it was permanently blocked by the courts. When the Kansas state Supreme Court in 2019 ruled on the law, it said that the right to an abortion was protected under Section 1 of the Kansas constitution’s Bill of Rights, which reads, “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” The court said that Section 1 “affords protection of the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one’s own body” and that this right “allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life – decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy.” The coalition behind the amendment is Value Them Both, led by Kansans for Life, the Kansas Catholic Conference and Kansas Family Voice. “Kansans want to ensure that moms and babies are protected. So, Kansans are very concerned about this push to make us an unlimited destination for abortion,” Brittany Jones, a lawyer who helped write the amendment, has told CNN.  Jones and Kansas Republicans had been working on the amendment for years.   The issue was placed on the primary ballot, rather than the general election, which abortion rights advocates believe was intended in order to limit turnout. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in the state by more than 350,000, according to the latest figures from the Kansas Secretary of State’s office.  The constitutional amendment has already raised voter interest in the primary election, according to the Kansas Secretary of State’s office.

396,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/media/alex-jones-punitive-damages-sandy-hook,"A Texas jury has decided to penalize Alex Jones with $45.2 million in punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victim Jesse Lewis. Plaintiffs Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis were awarded a total of just under $50 million in both compensatory and punitive damages. Of the total $49.3 million, the $45.2 million in punitive damages may be reduced due to Texas statute. “Care and concern is so important and we saw what happens when there is a dearth of that, and so I hope that we all just go home tonight and everybody that’s reading these articles and hearing this message and you chose love with your kids, because you can,” Lewis said Friday after learning of the jury’s decision. “That means being present in the moment with them, looking into their eyes, giving them a hug and just moving from there. Just every moment, realize that you have a choice and your choice is love.” The jurors began deliberating around 12:30 pm CT on Friday, after Judge Maya Guerra Gamble reminded them that in a default judgment against him Jones was already found liable for defamation and “intentional infliction of emotional distress” against Lewis and Heslin. In an emotional closing argument Friday, Lewis and Heslin’s attorney Wesley Todd Ball had said to the jury, “We ask that you send a very very simple message, and that is, stop Alex Jones. Stop the monetization of misinformation and lies. Please.” After the jury’s decision was announced in court, Jones’ attorney, Andino Reynal, immediately raised the issue of Texas law and the amount of punitive damages. Following the proceeding, he addressed it again while speaking outside the court. “We think the verdict was too high. As for punitive damages, Texas law caps them at $750,000 per plaintiff so this verdict today amounts to $1.5 million in punitives. Alex Jones will be on the air today, he’ll be on the air tomorrow, he’ll be on the air next week. He’s going to keep doing his job holding the power structure accountable. That’s our only statement,” Reynal said after court. Judge Gamble acknowledged Reynal’s objection in court but did not immediately rule on it. “So we do have laws in Texas where we claim to trust our juries and then we don’t trust our juries, and that’s true,” Gamble said at the time. “And I’m sure the judgment will properly reflect that laws of Texas in that regard, so don’t need to worry about that.”  CNN has reached out to an attorney for the plaintiffs for comment on Reynal’s argument. During closing arguments, Ball had urged the jurors to “deter Alex Jones from ever doing this awfulness again” and “to deter others who may want to step into his shoes.” Reynal had argued for a far lower sum, suggesting that the jurors should multiply Jones’ purported earnings per hour of $14,000 and the 18 hours that he said Jones talked about Sandy Hook on Infowars, for a sum of around a quarter million dollars.  On Thursday, in the first phase of the trial, the jury awarded the parents $4.1 million in compensatory damages, a far smaller amount than the $150 million the parents’ attorneys had sought. In his closing argument, Ball thanked the jury for their decision to award the $4.1 million, saying it had already made a huge difference in the parents’ lives, and asked them to award enough in punitive damages to bring the total to $150 million.  Punitive damages are a form of punishment for a defendant’s behavior. Jones, the head of the conspiratorial media outlet Infowars, repeatedly lied about the Sandy Hook massacre. He stoked conspiracy theories about the victims and their families, prompting multiple defamation lawsuits. He has since acknowledged that the mass shooting occurred. Jones claimed in his testimony that a jury award of just $2 million would destroy him financially. But on Friday morning the jurors heard testimony about Jones’ wealth from an economist, Bernard Pettingill, Jr., who estimated Jones has a net worth of between $135 million and $270 million. Pettingill, Jr., who examined several years of records for Jones and Infowars’ parent Free Speech Systems, said Jones used a series of shell companies to hide his money. Jones used two large loans to make it appear he was broke when in fact he was not, Pettingill, Jr. testified.  “Alex Jones knows where the money is, he knows where that money went and he knows that he is going to eventually benefit by that money,” Pettingill, Jr. said. After one of the jurors asked about the difference between Jones’ money and his company’s money, Pettingill, Jr. said “you cannot separate Alex Jones from the companies. He is the companies.” Jones “monetized his shtick,” he added, even suggesting that Jones could teach a college course about his techniques.  Jones’ fear-mongering rants on Infowars have, for many years, been paired with ads for supplements, documentaries, and other products Infowars sells. Pettingill, Jr. said the money poured in, identifying nine different companies that are owned by Jones.  “He is a very successful man, he promulgated some hate speech and some misinformation, but he made a lot of money and he monetized that,” Pettingill, Jr. said on the stand. “My thinking about him is he didn’t ride a wave, he created the wave.” Jones testified earlier in the week about his alleged financial troubles after social media giants like Facebook and Twitter banned his content from their platforms.  “I remember him saying that, but the records don’t reflect that,” Pettingill, Jr said. During closing arguments, Ball asserted that Jones has even more money hidden away in other places and argued that $4.1 million was a drop in Jones’ proverbial bucket. “He’s probably already made it back in donations” from fans, Ball said.

567,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/perspectives/billionaire-wealth-inequality-inflation-reduction-act/,"Editor’s Note: Sarah Anderson directs the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. Rebekah Entralgo is managing editor of Inequality.org, a website published by IPS. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.  Imagine if America’s ultra-wealthy invested the financial gains they made during the pandemic in affordable housing, child care centers or any of our country’s other urgent human needs.  As of May, US billionaires had seen their wealth rise by more than $1.7 trillion — an increase of almost 60% since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, according to the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness. They could easily marshal their vast resources to make people’s lives better — or at least blunt the pain many are still feeling from the height of the pandemic. Instead, how have we seen billionaires spending their fortunes? Space races. Jeff Bezos’s reported yacht that’s too big to get out of the port. Elon Musk’s impulsive $44 billion Twitter takeover bid that he’s now trying to abandon. Efforts to buy elections. It’s hardly any wonder that people across the political spectrum are fed up with the billionaire class.  But it’s taken much longer for Washington to get the message. It’s time for lawmakers and the administration to double down on addressing America’s wealth inequality before the next crisis hits. As US workers quit their jobs at record rates, we’re seeing Americans growing more frustrated with an economy where low-wage workers make just a tiny fraction of the mega-millions flowing to their bosses. A recent Institute for Policy Studies report found that the average CEO-worker pay gap at the 300 US corporations with the lowest median worker pay hit 670-to-1 in 2021. (That was up from an already staggering 604-to-1 in 2020.) Unionization campaigns are also surging, with election filings increasing 56% over the past nine months. It’s no coincidence that the two highest-profile unionization campaigns in the country are targeting companies — Starbucks and Amazon — with billionaire founders and CEOs.  The Inflation Reduction Act the Senate passed over the weekend would be a great start for generating significant revenue from those who should really be paying more. The biggest revenue-raiser is a 15% minimum tax on corporations with profits of $1 billion or more, which is expected to generate $258 billion over 10 years. This addresses the problem of the rampant tax dodging among large companies that has mostly benefited wealthy shareholders and executives.  The bill also includes a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks, raising an estimated additional $74 billion. This will discourage corporations from siphoning resources into share repurchases that largely benefit shareholders and executives with stock-based pay. Those resources could instead go toward worker wages or other productive investments.  And finally, the bill would boost IRS enforcement to ensure the ultra-rich pay what they owe instead of getting away with hiding their wealth through complex accounting tricks. If the bill passes the House, revenue from these tax reforms would be used to reduce the deficit and pay for climate programs, as well as capping out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 for those enrolled in Medicare drug plans and extending expiring enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage.   The legislation is far from perfect, though. Manchin and Schumer had initially agreed to substantially narrow one of the most obscene examples of how the rich have rigged our tax code: the “carried interest loophole.” Wealthy private equity and hedge fund managers have often paid lower tax rates than many firefighters and teachers because this loophole allows them to claim the bulk of their income as capital gains, which are taxed at a significantly lower rate than ordinary income. Under pressure from Senator Kyrsten Sinema, that gaping loophole will remain unchanged. Other effective proposals for tackling inequality, such as taxing the accumulated wealth of the ultra-rich, are also missing from the bill. Of course, low tax rates aren’t the only tool billionaires have used to concentrate their wealth and power. Lawmakers should also commit to reforming our nation’s charitable giving system, which the ultra-wealthy have turned into a taxpayer-subsidized platform of private power.  A new Institute for Policy Studies report documents that in 2020, wealthy Americans poured $48 billion into “donor-advised funds,” accounts that offer donors an immediate income tax deduction but have no legal requirement to pay out funds to charities — ever. The funds can exist in perpetuity and be passed on to heirs, delaying the civic benefit indefinitely. President Biden could also do more on his own to act against wealth inequality. For instance, he could go further to lift the student debt burden that is a driving factor in our nation’s wealth divide, particularly for families of color.  And he could build on his executive order requiring federal contractors to pay a minimum of $15 per hour by also prohibiting the CEOs of these firms from busting unions, manipulating stock prices through share buybacks, or paying themselves hundreds or even thousands of times more than their median-wage employees.  If we want to be stronger in the face of future crises, we need to tackle the wealth inequality that is distorting our democracy and leaving so many Americans behind.

292,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/robinhood-layoffs-crypto-fine,"Just months after cutting 9% of its workforce, Robinhood on Tuesday announced plans to lay off another 23%.  The latest cuts, which will affect 780 employees, continues a massive freefall for the once high-flying online brokerage. In a separate development Tuesday, the state of New York hit the Menlo Park, California, firm with a $30 million fine. In a blog post on the company’s website, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the “deterioration of the macro environment” — notably decades-high inflation coupled with a cryptocurrency crash — has reduced the company’s customer trading activity and assets under custody.   In its second-quarter earnings report, also released Tuesday, the company showed a 44% drop in revenue from a year ago. Robinhood’s monthly active users in June decreased by more than 7 million, or 34%, and that assets under custody have dropped by more than $37 billion, or 37%, from the second quarter of last year. The company’s staffing and operations approach, he added, was tailored for a continuation of the high-growth crypto boom of the pandemic era.  “Last year, we staffed many of our operations functions under the assumption that the heightened retail engagement we had been seeing with the stock and crypto markets in the COVID era would persist into 2022,” Tenev wrote in a message to employees. “In this new environment, we are operating with more staffing than appropriate.”  He added: ” As CEO, I approved and took responsibility for our ambitious staffing trajectory – this is on me.” The layoffs will affect employees across all functions of the company, with operations, marketing and program management positions being the hardest hit, he said. The company planned to notify all employees via email and Slack on Tuesday with their status as well as resources if they were affected. Separately on Tuesday, the New York State Department of Financial Services fined Robinhood’s cryptocurrency arm $30 million for allegedly violating reporting requirements related to anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations. “As its business grew, Robinhood Crypto failed to invest the proper resources and attention to develop and maintain a culture of compliance – a failure that resulted in significant violations of the department’s anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations,” Adrienne A. Harris, the department’s superintendent said in a statement.",,York State Department Of Financial Services,"CYBER_ATTACK,2197;CYBER_ATTACK,2453;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2197;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2453;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,2197;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,2453;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2197;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2453;ECON_IPO,1168;ECON_IPO,1234;ECON_INFLATION,544;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,544;WB_442_INFLATION,544;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SUPERINTENDENT,2518;TAX_FNCACT_SUPERINTENDENT,2518;AFFECT,170;AFFECT,1705;GENERAL_HEALTH,1095;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1095;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1095;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1095;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1095;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1095;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1095;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1095;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,184;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1492;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1715;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1889;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,1427;ECON_EARNINGSREPORT,701;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1397;ECON_BITCOIN,574;ECON_BITCOIN,2089;WB_698_TRADE,629;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,24;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2228;MEDIA_SOCIAL,403;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,447;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1592;ARREST,661;ARREST,882;USPEC_POLICY1,2209;USPEC_POLICY1,2465;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,506;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1517;",California;New York;Menlo Park
300,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/nfl-miami-dolphins-suspend/,"The NFL stripped the Miami Dolphins of two draft picks and suspended and fined owner Stephen Ross after a probe into allegations of tampering and tanking found that his team had impermissible contact with star quarterback Tom Brady and the agent of former Saints coach Sean Payton. The investigation, led by former US Attorney and SEC Chair Mary Jo White and lawyers from the Debevoise law firm, determined that the Dolphins violated anti-tampering rules on three occasions, the NFL announced in a news release Tuesday. The investigation also found that the team did not intentionally lose games, known as tanking, but noted that Ross repeatedly suggested that the team should prioritize its draft position over winning games during the 2019 season, the release said. As punishment, the Dolphins will forfeit their first-round pick in the 2023 draft and a third-round pick in the 2024 draft. Ross is suspended through October 17, six games into the 2022 season, and fined $1.5 million, the release said. “With regards to tampering, I strongly disagree with the conclusions and the punishment,” Ross said in a statement posted on the Miami Dolphins Twitter account. “However, I will accept the outcome because the most important thing is that there be no distractions for our team as we begin an exciting and winning season. I will not allow anything to get in the way of that.” The investigation found that the Dolphins had “impermissible communications” with Brady in 2019-20 while he was a member of the New England Patriots and again during and after the 2021 season when he was under contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to the NFL release. Those second discussions focused on Brady “becoming a limited partner in the Dolphins and possibly serving as a football executive,” and also included the possibility of playing for the Dolphins, the investigation found. The league found Dolphins Vice Chairman Bruce Beal spearheaded the contact with Brady and fined him $500,000. The Dolphins had no comment when asked about Beal’s actions. Further, in January 2022, the Dolphins had “impermissible communications” with the agent of Payton, who at the time was the New Orleans Saints head coach and has since retired. “The investigators found tampering violations of unprecedented scope and severity,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “I know of no prior instance of a team violating the prohibition on tampering with both a head coach and star player, to the potential detriment of multiple other clubs, over a period of several years. Similarly, I know of no prior instance in which ownership was so directly involved in the violations.”  The investigation also examined whether the Dolphins intentionally lost games in the 2019 season to improve their draft position, known as tanking. The Dolphins ultimately finished the 2019 season with a 5-11 record and earned the fifth pick in the 2020 NFL draft. The NFL investigation found the team did not lose games intentionally nor did any member from the club, including Ross, instruct then Dolphins coach Brian Flores to lose games, according to the release. However, the investigation found that Ross repeatedly expressed his belief that the team’s draft position should take priority over the win-loss record. In February, Flores told CNN that Ross explicitly told him he would give him $100,000 for each game Flores would lose. Ross denied the accusations at the time, calling the claims “baseless, unfair and disparaging.”   The investigation found that people had “differing recollections about the wording, timing, and context” of the claimed offer, according to the NFL news release. “However phrased, such a comment was not intended or taken to be a serious offer, nor was the subject pursued in any respect by Mr. Ross or anyone else at the club,” the release states. Goodell said in a statement that the comment, even if made as a joke, risked damaging the integrity of the game. “Every club is expected to make a good faith effort to win every game,” he said in a statement. “The integrity of the game, and public confidence in professional football, demand no less. An owner or senior executive must understand the weight that his or her words carry, and the risk that a comment will be taken seriously and acted upon, even if that is not the intent or expectation. Even if made in jest and not intended to be taken seriously, comments suggesting that draft position is more important than winning can be misunderstood and carry with them an unnecessary potential risk to the integrity of the game.” He praised Flores, who was fired earlier this year and has sued the Dolphins, the NFL and other teams alleging racial discrimination, for continuing to try to win games. The NFL and teams have denied the allegations. “The comments made by Mr. Ross did not affect Coach Flores’ commitment to win and the Dolphins competed to win every game,” Goodell said. “Coach Flores is to be commended for not allowing any comment about the relative importance of draft position to affect his commitment to win throughout the season.” Flores and attorneys say he was proved correct In a statement, Flores expressed his disappointment in what he says is the NFL investigation downplaying Ross’s comments on tanking. “I am thankful that the NFL’s investigator found my factual allegations against Stephen Ross are true,” Flores said. “At the same time, I am disappointed to learn that the investigator minimized Mr. Ross’s offers and pressure to tank games especially when I wrote and submitted a letter at the time to Dolphins executives documenting my serious concerns regarding this subject at the time which the investigator has in her possession.” His attorneys, Douglas H. Wigdor and John Elefterakis, expressed similar disappointment in the investigation’s assessment of Ross’s comments. “We are certainly disheartened that the investigator, and apparently the Commissioner, excused highly inappropriate comments that go to the heart of the game’s integrity regarding tanking as being in jest especially when there was a letter written by Coach Flores at the time demonstrating the gravity with which these comments were received by Coach Flores,” they said in a statement. “The punishment announced today is obviously inadequate and disheartening. Unfortunately, it remains clear that the NFL cannot police itself, which is why we look forward to continuing to push the legal process, prove all of Brian’s claims, as well as those of a class of black executives, coaches and candidate, and force real change upon the NFL.” Meanwhile, Ross in his statement said the investigation had cleared the Dolphins of tanking. “The independent investigation cleared our organization of any issues related to tanking and all of Brian Flores’ other allegations,” he said. “As I have said all along, these allegations were false, malicious and defamatory, and this issue is now put to rest.”",Mary Jo White;Brian Flores;Roger Goodell;Stephen Ross;Stephen Ross;John Elefterakis;Bruce Beal;Sean Payton;Brian Flore;Tom Brady,Cnn,,Tampa Bay;Miami
678,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/business/toyota-bz4x-buy-back/,"In June, Toyota issued a warning to owners of its BZ4X electric SUV that they should stop driving the vehicle and have it transported to a dealership because of a severe problem: the wheels could fall off while driving even after just a short time on the road. Toyota did not know why this was happening, but the automaker said it would investigate and have the problem corrected once engineers understood why the wheels were coming loose. Now, over a month later, Toyota has not yet identified the issue and is offering to simply buy back the SUVs from customers who no longer want to wait for the problem to be resolved. Because the issue became evident soon after the SUVs went on sale, there are only about 260 BZ4X owners in the United States facing this situation. There are more who had ordered the SUV but not yet had it delivered when the “Do not drive” warning was announced. Those customers have never been able to accept delivery of their SUVs. The automaker has offered a number of options beyond the buyback while it asks the owners for their patience. Toyota is also offering customers the free use of another Toyota vehicle until the issue is found and corrected. Toyota is also offering owners $5,000 toward their car payments or as a partial refund of the purchase price. Toyota will also extend the vehicles’ factory warranty by the amount of time — whatever it ends up being — that the SUVs have been taken out of service. For the customers who simply want to sell their vehicles back, the exact terms of the repurchase may vary depending on various state regulations and specifics of the owner’s situation.  The BZ4X is nearly identical to the Subaru Solterra electric SUV. The two Japanese automakers developed the vehicles jointly. Subaru did not have to recall any SUVs in the United States, though, because none had been delivered before the problem was discovered.  Toyota is not the first automaker to recall electric vehicles in recent years. General Motors offered to buy back Chevrolet Bolt EVs following reports of battery fires. That case involved potentially many more vehicles than the relative of handful of BZ4Xes, but Bolt owners were able to, at least, continue using their vehicles with certain restrictions. GM eventually discovered the source problem and is now able to replace batteries in vehicles that needed them. GM has not said how many customers took advantage of the buy-back offer.",Subaru Solterra,Subaru;Subaru;Toyota;Toyota;Toyota;Toyota;Toyota;Toyota;Toyota;Toyota;Cnn;United States;United States,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,1297;TAX_FNCACT_ENGINEERS,407;USPEC_POLICY1,1609;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,13;WB_135_TRANSPORT,146;TAX_ETHNICITY_JAPANESE,1735;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_JAPANESE,1735;",Japanese;United States

621,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/chuck-schumer-economic-bill-saturday/,"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support for President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals at her request, indicating she would “move forward” on Democrats’ sweeping economic package that has been the product of intensive negotiations for more than a year. Sinema’s support means Democrats likely will have 50 votes in their caucus to push the bill through their chamber by week’s end, before it moves to the House next week for final approval.  And while the plan is scaled back from Biden’s initial Build Back Better package, the latest bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest investment in energy and climate programs in US history, extend expiring health care subsidies for three years and give Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate prescription drug prices. The legislation would impose new taxes to pay for it. A remaining hurdle for Democrats: A review by Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who must decide whether the provisions in the bill meet strict rules to allow Democrats to use the filibuster-proof budget process to pass the legislation along straight party lines. But after days of talks with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sinema indicated she was ready to vote to proceed. “Subject to the Parliamentarian’s review, I’ll move forward,” she said in a statement after maintaining silence over the bill for more than a week. In the statement, Sinema indicated that she won several changes to the tax provisions in the package, including removing the provision that would have tightened the carried interest loophole, which aimed to raise the taxes paid by hedge fund and private equity managers. That proposal would have raised $14 billion. She also suggested that she won changes to Democrats’ plans to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes – a key demand by manufacturers that had lobbied Sinema over their concerns this week. “We have agreed to remove the carried interest tax provision, protect advanced manufacturing, and boost our clean energy economy in the Senate’s budget reconciliation legislation,” Sinema said.  To make up for the lost revenue, Democrats agreed to add a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks as part of the agreement, raising another $73 billion, according to a Democratic aide. “The agreement will include a new excise tax on stock buybacks that brings in far more revenue than the carried interest provision did, meaning the deficit reduction figure will remain at $300 billion,” a Democrat familiar with the agreement told CNN. The $300 billion target in deficit reduction had been a key priority of Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who signed onto the deal after negotiations with Schumer last week. “The agreement preserves the major components of the Inflation Reduction Act, including reducing prescription drug costs, fighting climate change, closing tax loopholes exploited by big corporations and the wealthy, and reducing the deficit by $300 billion,” Schumer said in a statement. “The final version of the Reconciliation bill, to be introduced on Saturday, will reflect this work and put us one step closer to enacting this historic legislation into law.” High-stakes negotiations  Earlier Thursday, top Senate Democrats engaged in high-stakes negotiations with Sinema, actively discussing potential changes to major tax components in order to secure the Arizona moderate’s support. In private discussions, Sinema had expressed concern over key parts of the Democrats’ plan to pay for their climate and health care package – imposing a 15% tax minimum tax on big corporations and narrowing the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to pay a lower tax rate on much of their compensation. As a result, Democrats had been scrambling to find new revenue sources to meet the goal of saving $300 billion over a decade. “Failure is not an option,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, expressing the view of much of his caucus earlier Thursday that Sinema would eventually get on board. Schumer announced earlier on Thursday that the Senate will reconvene on Saturday and plans to take the first procedural vote to proceed to the bill. If the vote gets the backing of all 50 members of the Democratic caucus, there would then be up to 20 hours of debate. Following debate time, there would be a process colloquially referred to on Capitol Hill as “vote-a-rama,” which is the marathon series of amendment votes with no time limit before the final vote. If the bill ultimately passes, the House would need to act. Democrats are trying to wrap up negotiations and pass their economic passage before leaving town for a month-long August recess. The measure would invest $369 billion into energy and climate change programs with the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. For the first time, Medicare would be empowered to negotiate the prices of certain medications, and it would cap out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 for those enrolled in Medicare drug plans. It would also impose penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation and extend expiring enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage for three years. It’s not clear if all these provisions will survive the parliamentarian’s review. Heavy pressure on Sinema  Sinema was not part of the deal, learning of it when the news broke last week. She had refused to comment publicly on the deal, with her aides only saying she would wait until the Senate parliamentarian’s review is done before taking a position. Yet she had been making her demands clear with Democratic leaders, including seeking to add $5 billion to help the Southwest cope with its multi-year drought, according to multiple sources. As Democrats courted her, Republicans and business groups made their concerns known. In a private call this week, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, urged Sinema to press to change the corporate minimum tax. The president of the Arizona business group, Danny Seiden, told CNN that he expressed the business community’s opposition to the 15% tax provision, noting it would particularly hit manufacturers that take advantage of an accelerated depreciation tax deduction that lowers their tax burden. “Is this written in a way that’s bad?” Sinema asked, according to Seiden, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, who relayed the call to CNN.  “It gave me hope that she’s willing to open this up and maybe make it better,” Seiden said. Two sources told CNN that Sinema had privately relayed those concerns to top Democrats, arguing it would hurt manufacturers including in her state.  In an effort to break the logjam, Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper, a freshman Democrat, proposed the excise tax on stock buybacks to Schumer as a way to make up for the revenue lost by Sinema’s requests, according to a Democratic aide. At issue are changes proposed by Democrats on bonus depreciation that the GOP enacted in the 2017 tax law, which allows companies to deduct 100% of the cost of an asset the year it is placed in service. The new legislation proposed to phase that down starting next year. It’s unclear exactly how the new language is structured on this issue. Defending the new tax, the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee released data on Thursday from the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation showing that up to 125 billion-dollar companies averaged only a 1.1% effective tax rate in 2019. The committee argues in its release that this shows the “rock-bottom tax rates” that some companies are able to pay.  “While we know that billion-dollar companies are avoiding paying their fair share, these tax rates are lower than we could have imagined,” said Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. “We’re going to put a stop to it with our 15 percent minimum tax.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.

153,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/entertainment/prey-review/,"For those who remember the original “Predator,” the alien hunter’s code of conduct – only using the weapons and force required to make things sporting – helps mightily when trying to fight it. Even so, “Prey” represents an odd if refreshingly spare addition to the franchise, giving a coming-of-age spin to a faceoff that can’t help but feel like a serious mismatch. Landing directly on Hulu (a choice that seemingly speaks to the film’s perceived theatrical prospects), this latest entry in a series that hasn’t been particularly memorable since the first movie proves small-boned by the genre’s standards, dropping the hulking killer in Comanche territory 300 years ago, where its trophies initially include plenty of the local fauna. The thrills don’t look cheap, exactly, but the whole thing feels a bit cheaper, as if this were the pilot for an anthology series titled “Tales of the Predator,” charting periodic visits through history. “A long time ago, it is said, a monster came here,” the movie says at the start, before introducing Naru (Amber Midthunder), a young female warrior who wishes to be taken seriously as a hunter because, she says, “you all think that I can’t.” Naru soon gets the test of several lifetimes, recognizing that the alien (played by Dane DiLiegro, a 6’9” former basketball player) isn’t an animal but something different, while also learning its strengths, weaknesses and the peculiar game that it plays in terms of who and what it chooses to kill. When it comes to battling Predators, brains tend to trump brawn. Nevertheless, using spears and (thanks to French traders) the occasional musket in this struggle seems like an even more gargantuan task than the mano-a-alien fight that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Dutch orchestrated 35 years ago, and he had the advantage of explosives and being able to hoist tree trunks. There’s a history of setting science-fiction stories in the past – the 2011 movie “Cowboys & Aliens” comes to mind – and grounding this story around Native-American people offers a window into that culture. Still, those elements are by necessity treated in once-over-lightly fashion given the grisly business at hand. Directed by Dan Trachtenberg (“10 Cloverfield Lane”), the novelty of “Prey’s” backdrop thus wears off pretty quickly, and even at a briskly paced 90-some-odd minutes, the movie fosters a sense of impatience about what Naru can devise to level the playing field. Until that climactic showdown, the best thing going for it is Midthunder, whose recent roles include “The Ice Road” and the CW’s “Roswell, New Mexico,” making the most of this physically demanding starring vehicle. “Prey” works best in the context of an old-fashioned B horror movie, dropping a monster in a (very) remote locale, where almost no one can hear you scream. Thematically, it’s an interesting addition to a franchise that returns every few years whether needed or not. When compared to recent predecessors this straight-to-streaming specimen isn’t bad, but it only feels worth adding to the “watch” list for those truly committed to collecting them all. “Prey” premieres Aug. 5 on Hulu. It’s rated R.",Dane Diliegro;Dan Trachtenberg;Amber Midthunder,Cnn,,New Mexico;French;American
75,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/russia-ukraine-prison-attack/,"US officials believe Russia is preparing to falsify evidence to blame Ukrainian forces for last week’s deadly blast at the Olenivka prison ahead of visits to the site by outside parties.  An administration official told CNN they expect Russia will falsify evidence, blame Ukrainian forces, and even have “reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS were to blame before journalists arrive.” John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, confirmed that reporting Thursday.  “We anticipate that Russian officials will try to frame the Ukrainian Armed Forces in anticipation of journalists and potential investigators visiting the site of the attack,” Kirby said. “In fact, we’ve already seen some spurious press reports to this effect, where they have planted evidence. We have reason to believe that Russia would go so far as to make it appear that Ukrainian HIMARS – the high mobility advanced rocket systems that have been so much in the news lately – were to blame.” “And to do that before journalists arrived on site, and again, we’re beginning to even start to see some press reporting to that effect,” Kirby told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond when asked for further information on the reported plan to falsify evidence.  The US supplied Ukraine with the HIMARS multiple launch rocket system earlier this year. The US believes Russia has collected large quantities of HIMARS fragments from strikes against its positions in Ukraine and is likely to deliberately place them at sites such as the prison to claim Ukraine was responsible, according to an administration official familiar with the latest information. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday the attack on the prison in separatist-held eastern Ukraine, which resulted in the deaths of at least 50 prisoners, was “a deliberate war crime by the Russians.” Russia, meanwhile, blamed Ukraine for the attack. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday reiterated the Russian claim that the Ukrainian military was responsible for the attack. “There is evidence here and there is nothing to hide here,” he told CNN. “Moreover, you know that the Russian side proposed to the UN and invited the Red Cross to get acquainted with this evidence on the spot, to conduct the necessary exhaustive investigation.” The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed Wednesday it had been able to visit the Olenivka facility only once –  in May this year to deliver water tanks. “But we did not have access to POWs held there on an individual basis – as per ICRC’s modalities of work in detention facilities – and that continues to be the case,” it said. The ICRC added: “Under the Third Geneva Convention, during international armed conflicts, the ICRC must be granted access to all PoWs, wherever they are held. We also have full liberty to choose the places we wish to visit. Since February 2022, our teams have been able to have access to some PoWs, but not all.” The ICRC says it has requested access to the detention center again since the attack last week, but has not received permission from the Russians. The Olenivka prison near Donetsk has been used to house many of the Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol several months ago. CNN could not independently verify the allegations of either side. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a Wednesday news conference that the UN is seeking to establish a fact-finding team to study the attack following requests from both Russia and Ukraine to investigate. He added that the terms of reference for the panel would need to be accepted by Russia and Ukraine before the fact-finding mission would begin.  Video aired on Russian networks and shared on social media channels in Donetsk show extensive destruction to a building and several bodies. CNN was able to geolocate footage of the strike to an industrial area about two miles outside the frontline town of Olenivka. The Ukrainian military said the explosion took place on the territory of the industrial zone, in a newly-constructed building specially equipped to hold prisoners taken out of Azovstal. The Ukrainian prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into the strike. In a statement, it said pretrial preliminary data shows “the occupying state struck the territory of penal colony No. 120 in the temporarily occupied Olenivka village of Volnovakha district of Donetsk region.” Donetsk and Luhansk are the two regions that together form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014.  The area has become the centerpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year. The Russian military has kept up a persistent barrage of artillery and missile strikes across the region for several weeks. The Kremlin says the goal of what it calls its “special military operation” is to take control of both Luhansk and Donetsk.  This story has been updated with additional details.

552,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It’s August, and that means pretty much all of Wall Street is on vacation right now. The Fed has locked its doors and said, “See you in September.” And politicos are island hopping: VP Kamala Harris made a fundraising appearance on the Vineyard this week alongside the Obamas. Turns out inflation may be taking a summer break, too. The Survey of Consumer Expectations on Monday showed that expectations of higher prices are easing. Respondents to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey in July expect inflation to grow at a 6.2% pace over the next year before falling to 3.2% for the next three years. Those numbers are definitely high, but they’re a drop from the 6.8% and 3.6% predicted in the June survey. Expectations for food and gas prices, which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes have little control over, also fell. Consumer psychology impacts the economy and we can talk ourselves into lower inflation. If consumers believe price pressures are easing, they may rein in their spending and that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Another factor that could help the inflation crisis: Gas prices rose by a whopping 60% over the past year, but have been steadily declining over the past few weeks. The price per gallon has gone down by about 67 cents in the last month, but overall it’s still 87 cents higher than it was last year.   It remains to be seen how these changes will affect the Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, on Wednesday. CPI climbed 1.0% in May and 1.3% in June, which pushed the year-over-year inflation rate to 9%. That’s the hottest pace since November 1981.  But recent declines in gas and food prices could cut inflation significantly. The monthly rate could go as low as 0.2% in July and turn negative in August, according to David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “Overall, with demand slowing and supply picking up, we expect to see steady downward pressure on inflation for the rest of this year and in 2023 even if the Federal Reserve pursues a slightly less hawkish path,” he wrote in a note Monday.  And if that’s not enough inflation news for you, on Thursday we’ll see the latest data from the Producer Price Index, which is the Federal Reserve’s favorite way to measure inflation. Like CPI, PPI has surged over the past few months but analysts generally expect price increases to slow. Not everyone agrees, though. “Markets currently appear to expect that a mild [economic] contraction will result in falling rates and lower inflation,” wrote analysts from the BlackRock Investment Institute in a note Monday. “We don’t think such a ‘soft landing’ is likely in a volatile macro regime shaped by production constraints. Central banks will have to plunge the economy into a deep recession if they really want to squash today’s inflation — or live with more inflation. We think they’ll ultimately do the latter — but they are not ready to pivot yet.” Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said last weekend that she doesn’t think inflation will come down soon and that interest rates should keep increasing. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said something similar, warning that rate increases were far from over.  And what about all of the commotion in D.C.? Senate Democrats worked overtime this week to pass a sweeping economic package that they’re calling the Inflation Reduction Act. The hulking 755-page bill includes $430 billion to combat climate change, increase health care coverage, and boost taxes on corporations while reducing the deficit. It’s a good plan for Democrats who face midterm elections in three months, but won’t actually do much to ease inflation in the short-term; none of the bill’s provisions will go into effect until 2023.  Bad news for Buffett? Think again. Warren Buffet’s company lost $44 billion dollars last quarter. That sounds like a lot of money to me, but hey, what do I know?  It’s really no big deal, reports my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica. In fact, things are looking up for The Oracle of Omaha’s Berkshire Hathaway.  The conglomerate posted a net loss of nearly $44 billion in the second quarter, mostly due to big drops in its stock portfolio: Berkshire owns huge amounts of Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Chevron and American Express.  But Berkshire’s operations are actually very strong. The firm reported an operating profit of $9.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 40% from a year ago. Berkshire’s businesses have bounced back from the Covid-induced slowdown in 2020. Plus, Buffett is known for thinking of market downturns as prime buying opportunities. Berkshire has been aggressive this quarter, purchasing a large stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum and announcing an $11.6 billion deal for insurer Alleghany earlier this year.  Retirement, here I come Covid-19 changed the way we measure time. There are real years, and then there are those pandemic years which either flew by at superspeed or dragged on forever, depending on who you ask.  Thankfully, the job losses, economic downturn and change in the passage of time experienced during the first year of the pandemic haven’t changed elderly Americans’ retirement expectations.  About 60% of the 20,000 respondents in the University of Michigan’s 2020 Health and Retirement Study reported that their work was affected by the pandemic, 55% said they had to stop work entirely and 15% lost their job permanently. But financial situations remained remarkably stable. About three-quarters of the participants said that their finances were the same, and 60% said their household spending didn’t change in 2020.  “The results of this study imply that elderly American adults’ retirement expectations remain uninterrupted despite enduring through the Covid-19 impact on their work and financial situations in 2020,” wrote analysts at the Employee Benefit Research Institute.

544,https://www.cnn.com/2013/12/25/world/asia/japan-pm-war-shrine/,"Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story had an incorrect reference to an island dispute between Japan and South Korea. The reference has been removed. A 30-minute visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to a controversial shrine that includes the names of convicted war criminals ignited a predictable firestorm of criticism and condemnation Thursday from Japan’s neighbors.  The Yasukuni Shrine is regarded by China, North Korea and South Korea as a symbol of Japan’s imperial military past. All three countries suffered under Japan’s military aggression in World War II. Millions of Chinese civilians and soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of Koreans, died.  So, each time a top Japanese official has visited, the countries have protested – saying the visits honor war criminals and deny Japan’s atrocities in Asia.  Not so, said Abe on Thursday. He wanted to pray for the souls of the war dead, not honor war criminals, he said.  “I have renewed my determination before the souls of the war dead to firmly uphold the pledge never to wage a war again,” he said.  There are more than 2.4 million names enshrined at Yasukuni. But among them are 14 who were found guilty of war crimes by a military tribunal in Tokyo in 1945. Abe’s visit came exactly a year after he took office, during which time he has received the cold shoulder from both Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Park Geun-hye during regional conferences.  It also comes at a time when Japan and China have ratcheted up rhetoric over the ownership of a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu islands in China and the Senkakus in Japan.  Japan and South Korea also have had their own territorial disputes. Perhaps to preempt the outrage over his visit, Abe struck a conciliatory tone afterward. “It is not my intention at all to hurt the feelings of the Chinese and Korean people,” he said.  “It is my wish to respect each other’s character, protect freedom and democracy, and build friendship with China and Korea with respect, as did all the previous Prime Minsiters who visited the Yasukuni Shrine.” It was too little too late.  Japanese Prime Minister Ab visits controversial Yasukuni war shrine Immediate outrage The Chinese foreign ministry immediately issued a tersely worded statement, saying Beijing “expresses strongest indignation for this act, which heavily offends the Chinese people and people of other Asian countries that were victims of WWII.” “Honoring the shrine is, in its essence, embellishing and falsely beautifying Japan’s military invasion and colonization.”  Speaking at a press conference, South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism said that he cannot help but deplore and express anger and urged Japan to stop “beautifying” its invasion. The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said it was disappointed by the visit.  “Japan is a valued ally and friend,” the embassy said. “Nevertheless, the United States is disappointed that Japan’s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan’s neighbors.” Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Japan’s Temple University, said Japan has made its history into an issue when it should be seeking the cooperation of China and South Korea in dealing with the threat North Korea poses.  “Trampling on the neighbors’ sensitivities about their shared past also limits room for managing territorial disputes involving both countries or making headway on a range of other pressing issues,” he said.  A matter of perspective? In his statement after the visit, Abe acknowledged that such visits have become a political and diplomatic issue. But should they be? Depends on the perspective, says J. Berkshire Miller, a fellow on Japan at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Pacific Forum.   The Yasukuni shrine remembers Japan’s war dead not just from World War II, but also its war against Imperial Germany during World War I and the Satsuma rebellion in the 19th century.  In October, several officials, including Abe’s brother – senior vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi – visited the shrine, according to Kyodo News. The visits were part of an autumn festival and included 159 members of the Diet, Japan’s national legislature. The Prime Minister refrained from visiting the shrine then, but sent an offering.  The lawmakers insisted the visits have been misrepresented by the foreign media and that the shrine is where Japanese visitors go to “pray for peace.”  The site, built in 1869, enshrines those who “devoted their lives to their country,” the group said at the time.  “The problem for Japan,” says Miller, “is that none of this matters to many of its critics.” CNN’s Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo; Ed Payne wrote from Atlanta.

188,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/arizona-michigan-missouri-primary-election-takeaways/,"Kansas voters handed abortion-rights advocates a massive victory Tuesday, surging to the polls to defeat a measure that would have allowed the GOP-led legislature to impose new restrictions. The vote in Kansas was one of the first tests of the potency of abortion rights at the ballot box since the Supreme Court’s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade and end the federal protection of abortion access.  Catch up on the night’s news here Meanwhile, in Michigan, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump was ousted, while the matchup was set for what will be one of the key gubernatorial races this fall. And in Missouri, the political comeback of a former governor was shut down. In Arizona, local elections officials were still counting votes, but some of the slate of statewide candidates who were endorsed by former President Donald Trump and promoted his lies about election fraud won their Republican primaries, CNN projects. Here are six takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries: Kansas maintains constitutional right to abortion Kansas voters sent a dramatic message on Tuesday, opting to maintain the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution just weeks after the US Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade. Polls have long shown that voters overwhelmingly support protecting abortions rights. But the win for the “no” vote in Kansas is proof of that and signals that the Supreme Court decision has further angered voters and possibly shifted the politics of the issue ahead of the November elections. The “no” leaves the state constitution unchanged. While lawmakers in the state can still try to pass restrictive abortion laws, courts in Kansas have recognized a right to abortion under the state constitution. The biggest warning to Republicans, many of whom have trumpeted the overturning of Roe and backed pushes to pass stricter abortions laws, is perhaps the turnout in Kansas. With 78% of the vote in on Tuesday night, nearly 700,000 people have cast ballots in the primary, a figure that already dwarfs the turnout in the 2020 presidential primary election. “This is further proof of what poll after poll has told us: Americans support abortion rights,” said Christina Reynolds, a top operative for Emily’s List, an organization that looks to elect women who support abortion rights. “They believe we should be able to make our own health care decisions, and they will vote accordingly, even in the face of misleading campaigns.” A member of the ‘impeachment 10’ is defeated Rep. Peter Meijer became the second of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump to be ousted in a primary Tuesday, losing to Trump-endorsed conservative challenger John Gibbs, CNN projected.  Democrats played a role in boosting Gibbs – a calculated decision that has become a flashpoint, angering some Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans.  Meijer, a freshman, voted to impeach Trump just days after taking office, after the insurrection of January 6, 2021. Gibbs, meanwhile, backed Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.  Meijer’s loss means the Grand Rapids-based 3rd District seat will be one of the most competitive House contests in November’s midterm elections.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, eyeing the seat as a possible pick-up opportunity, spent more than $300,000 on television ads seeking to bolster Gibbs with pro-Trump GOP primary voters by portraying him as a Trump-aligned conservative.  In Washington, two more Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse, were attempting to survive their own primaries. The state’s open, non-partisan primary system in which the top two finishers regardless of party advance to November’s general election made them more difficult targets for Trump and his supporters.  Unknowns in Arizona Arizona’s race for the Republican nomination for governor could depend on whether Trump’s supporters turned out in force on election day in a state that conducts its contests largely by mail.  Karrin Taylor Robson, a former member of the Arizona Board of Regents who is backed by former Vice President Mike Pence and outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey, led former television journalist Kari Lake, a Trump-endorsed election denier, in the early returns Wednesday morning.  But the early results were largely mail-in ballots. Votes cast on election day were expected to favor Lake – a result of Trump’s years-long effort to undermine faith in mail-in voting. The Arizona gubernatorial primary was the most significant contest in a set of primaries that tested Trump’s influence over the GOP.  If Trump’s slate of statewide candidates in Arizona advances to the general election, they’d be positioned to take over the election machinery of one of the nation’s most important presidential battleground states if they win in November. Blake Masters, the venture capitalist endorsed by Trump and backed by millions in spending from GOP megadonor Peter Thiel, won the state’s GOP primary to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, CNN projects.  State Rep. Mark Finchem, a Trump-endorsed “Stop the Steal” activist who has said the state legislature should be able to overturn voters’ will in presidential elections, won the GOP primary for secretary of state, CNN projects. Democrats saw a tight race between Maricopa County recorder Adrian Fontes and state Rep. Reginald Bolding.  And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN projects. There was also one person who had defied Trump and his election lies ousted on Tuesday, according to a CNN projection: Rusty Bowers, the Arizona House speaker. Bowers testified in June about the pressure he faced to overturn the state’s 2020 election results from Trump and others. In return, he was censured by his party, called “unfit to serve” – and now has lost his primary for a state Senate seat. Greitens’ attempted comeback falls flat  Republicans in Missouri breathed a sigh of relief after state Attorney General Eric Schmitt won the wide-open Senate primary, according to a CNN projection.   Perhaps more significant than who won, though, in the deep-red state, is who lost: disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who was attempting a political comeback. Greitens resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusation of campaign misconduct, and subsequently faced abuse allegations from his ex-wife, which he has denied Schmitt, the attorney general, emerged from a crowded field that included two members of Congress, Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long.  Trump stayed out of the race, issuing a tongue-in-cheek statement supporting “Eric” on the eve of the primary – leaving it up to voters’ interpretation whether that meant Schmitt or Greitens.  Dixon victory in Michigan governor’s race sets up referendum on Covid policies  Tudor Dixon, the conservative commentator endorsed by Trump in the final days of the race and backed by large factions of the Michigan Republican establishment, won the state’s GOP primary to take on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN projected.  The clash in Michigan could be one of the nation’s most competitive governor’s races.  Whitmer has cast herself as a bulwark for abortion rights in a state where Republicans have sought to enforce a 1931 law that would impose a near-total ban on abortion.  Dixon, meanwhile, framed the race in her victory speech Tuesday night as a referendum on restrictions Whitmer imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Dixon, a mother of four who is backed by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s family, is also an advocate of school choice — potentially positioning education as a marquee issue in November’s midterm election. Progressives suffer another defeat in Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens’ projected Democratic primary victory in Michigan’s newly drawn 11th Congressional District over fellow Rep. Andy Levin marks another blow against progressives in what has been a mostly disappointing primary season. It’s also a resounding victory for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and its super PAC, United Democracy Project, which has spent millions backing moderate, more staunchly pro-Israel candidates in Democratic primaries. Stevens and Levin are both supportive of Israel, but Levin – who is Jewish – has been more willing to criticize its government’s treatment of Palestinians and is the lead sponsor of the Two-State Solution Act. Progressive Democrats, frequently targeted by AIPAC spending this primary season, have fumed at fellow Democrats for accepting or courting support from the group, which has also contributed to Republican election deniers. AIPAC has defended the practice, arguing that its policy goals need bipartisan support. J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group that has clashed with AIPAC, tried to boost Levin with a $700,000 July ad buy, but that sum paled in comparison to the millions bundled by AIPAC and more than $4 million spend by UDP.",Christina Reynolds;Eric Schmitt;Donald Trump;Eric Greitens;Vicky Hartzler;Billy Long,Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Us Supreme Court;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1494;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2233;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,595;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,329;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,2535;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2941;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,1311;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,1311;LEADER,368;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,368;ELECTION,14;ELECTION,1058;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1880;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,73;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,259;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,520;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,572;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,895;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1391;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1630;CONSTITUTIONAL,545;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2802;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,2802;SCANDAL,2476;GENERAL_HEALTH,2090;MEDICAL,2090;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,2007;TRIAL,2292;TRIAL,2727;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2292;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2727;RESIGNATION,2563;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1123;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1215;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,2095;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2858;LEGISLATION,1372;LEGISLATION,1595;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,24;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1013;",Kansas;Michigan;Americans;Arizona;Washington;Missouri
236,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/entertainment/prince-estate-settled/,"Prince’s estate is finally settled after a six-year court battle. The late singer did not leave a will regarding his $156 million estate. After the singer died in 2016, his six half-siblings were named his legal heirs.  Now, according to a copy of court documents obtained by CNN, the Minnesota First Judicial District has ordered the cash in Prince’s estate be split evenly between Prince Legacy LLC and Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Prince Legacy LLC consists of interests previously held by three of Prince’s half-siblings, Sharon Nelson, John Nelson and Norrine Nelson. According to court documents, Prince Oat Holdings LLC is owned by music publishing company Primary Wave and consists of interests once held by Tyka Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson, as well as three separate entities owned by Primary Wave. Also listed in the documents is the bank that was assigned by the court to administrate the estate’s affairs during litigation.  Comerica Bank & Trust gets $3 million to pay the costs and expenses associated with closing the estate, “including the preparation of tax returns, professional fees, expenses and any awards entered in pending litigation involving the Estate.” Whatever is left over gets split between Prince Oat Holdings LLC and Prince Legacy LLC.

583,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/asia/taiwan-china-military-drills-intl-hnk/,"Chinese forces took part in drills focused on land attacks and long-range airstrikes around Taiwan on Sunday, its military said, on what was expected to be the final day of extensive exercises rolled out in response to a visit to the island by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese military said on Sunday around noon local time that it conducted live-fire drills in the waters and airspace around Taiwan “as planned.” “The drills focused on joint fire land strikes and long-range air strike capabilities,” the command said in a statement posted to its official account on the social media platform Weibo, without specifying whether the drills have ended. The exercises, planned to take place in six zones around the island, began Thursday and were scheduled to last until Sunday at noon local time in Beijing, Chinese state media reported. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said that as of 5 p.m. local time on Sunday, 66 Chinese warplanes and 14 Chinese vessels were detected operating around the Taiwan Strait. Among the 22 jets entering the airspace around Taiwan, 12 crossed the median line, the statement read. The ministry previously called the drills a “simulated attack against the main island of Taiwan and Taiwan’s naval vessels” – a slight dial-up of language from Saturday when it said that Chinese military drills around the island could be a “possible simulated attack.”  Taiwan’s military “closely monitored” the situation and deployed aircraft and vessels to “appropriately” react to Chinese military drills around the island, the Defense Ministry added. It also said drones “intruded” into outlying islands controlled by Taiwan.  China announced the drills – whose scale marks a significant escalation from past activities – within an hour of the arrival of Pelosi and a congressional delegation in Taiwan on Tuesday evening. The stop, which was expected but not announced beforehand, was part of a larger Asia tour. Chinese officials had repeatedly warned Washington of unspecified repercussions in the lead-up to the expected trip. In addition to the drills, Beijing also launched a raft of diplomatic penalties, including canceling future phone calls between Chinese and US defense leaders and suspending bilateral climate talks.  The Chinese Communist Party views self-governing Taiwan as its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has long vowed to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland – by force if necessary.  The previous days’ drills had seen a number of air and maritime operations around the island, including the launch of 11 ballistic missiles on Thursday – some of which flew over the island of Taiwan and landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone. That marked the first time China had sent missiles over the island. On Saturday, 14 vessels and 20 planes operated by the Chinese military were detected around the strait, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. Of the 20 aircraft, 14 crossed the median line, it added. On Friday, 68 Chinese warplanes were reported in the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry. Of those, 49 entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone – a buffer of airspace commonly referred to as an ADIZ. That was just a few planes short of the record set last year when 56 Chinese warplanes entered the ADIZ on the same day.  Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang on Sunday reiterated Taiwan’s condemnation of the drills. “Not only Taiwan but other countries in the region as well as freedom-loving countries like the US and so on have vehemently protested and condemned China’s arrogant military operations disrupting regional peace and stability,” he said during a press engagement. “We call on the Chinese government to not flex its military muscles and disrupt regional peace.” A US National Security Council spokesperson on Saturday called China’s recent military activities around Taiwan a “significant escalation in China’s efforts to change the status quo.”  “They are provocative, irresponsible, and raise the risk of miscalculation,” the spokesperson said. “They are also at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which is what the world expects.” US allies have also come forward to condemn China’s actions, including in a joint statement issued Friday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa following their meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Cambodia. The diplomats “condemned (China’s) launch of ballistic missiles,” including those the Japanese government said landed in its exclusive economic zone, for “raising tension and destabilizing the region,” and called on China “to immediately cease the military exercises,” according to the statement released by the US State Department. China hit back on Saturday evening, with its embassy in Australia calling the US “the biggest saboteur and destabilizer of peace in the Taiwan Strait” and disputing the “legal basis” for Japan’s claims regarding the missile landings. “China is the victim of political provocation from the US. The actions taken by the Chinese government to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity and curb the separatist activities are legitimate and justified,” a statement from the embassy read.

117,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/joe-manchin-energy-health-care-bill-cnntv/,"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin argued Sunday that Republicans would in “normal times” support an energy and health care bill he recently negotiated with leaders of his party, saying the major piece of legislation addresses key areas the GOP has long championed. “I think it’s a great piece of legislation and on normal times, my Republican colleagues would be for something such as this. We’ve basically paid down debt, (which) is what they want. We’ve accelerated permitting, which is what they want. And we’ve increased production of energy, which is what they want. We’ve done things that we should be doing together,” Manchin, who represents West Virginia, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Manchin said the bill he negotiated with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is not “inflammatory” despite some reports promoted by Republicans that show it could add to inflation and raise taxes.  “Well, we found that they were wrong. And people can be wrong, but how in the world can it be inflammatory?” Manchin told Tapper. “How can it add flames to inflation fires right now if you’re paying down debt?” He added: “We’re doing everything we can to make sure we attack the problem. And these are solutions to the problems we have. So I know the ones playing politics with it.” When Manchin and Schumer, a New York Democrat, announced the deal last week, it represented a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again. Though many details have not been disclosed, the measure would invest $369 billion into energy and climate change programs, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, according to a one-page fact sheet. It would also address the permitting of energy infrastructure, which could ease the path for a shale gas pipeline in West Virginia. Manchin on Sunday was asked about getting fellow moderate Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s support for the legislation. “Sen. Sinema is my dear friend. We work very close together on so many things, and she has so much in this piece of legislation. She’s formed quite a bit of and worked on it very hard. And with that, she’s brought down drug prices, she’s been very instrumental in letting Medicare go ahead and negotiate for lower drug prices,” Manchin said of the Arizona senator. He added: “I think that basically when she looks at the bill and sees the whole spectrum of what we’re doing … hopefully she will be positive about it, but she’ll make her decision and I respect that.” Manchin also defended a provision in the bill that would impose a 15% minimum tax on certain corporations. “People should be paying their fair share, especially the largest corporations in America that have a billion dollars of value or greater. Can’t they pay at least 15%, so that we can move forward and be the leader of the world and the superpower that we are?” he told Tapper, adding that the bill “was not putting a burden on any taxpayers whatsoever.” Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee on Saturday released data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that showed that Americans of all incomes would see their federal taxes rise under the climate and health care package. That analysis, however, looked at the indirect effect of the 15% minimum tax provision on corporations. Economists assume companies would then pass along part of their tax increase to employees by reducing their after-tax wages and job opportunities. Also, shareholders would take a hit since the value of their stock holdings, including those held in pensions and mutual funds, would likely decline. Manchin said Sunday he hopes the legislation passes before the August recess, which is what Democratic leadership is hoping for. The senator’s support is notable given his stance earlier this month that he “unequivocally” wouldn’t support the climate or tax provisions of the Democratic economic package, which appeared to torpedo any hope Democrats had of passing legislation to fight climate change in the near future. But he told Tapper on Sunday that he “never did walk away” from negotiations with Schumer. “I never did walk away, but we reorganized the bill, if you will,” he said. “What we had before that, there were things in there that I considered and thought could be considered to be inflammatory. … Inflation is the greatest challenge we have in our country right now – around in my state and around the country. So that’s what we’re fighting.” Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania slammed the deal in a separate appearance later on “State of the Union,” arguing that it would negatively impact the US economy at a critical time. “We haven’t seen any text, we don’t even know what it looks like. So this is a disaster. This is going to make our recession worse. It’s going to make inflation worse. It’s not gonna do any good. I am really surprised that Joe agreed to this,” he told Tapper.

125,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/blake-masters-mark-finchem-gop-nominations-arizona-trump/,"Three Donald Trump-endorsed Republicans who have embraced the former President’s 2020 election lies will win the GOP nominations for US Senate, secretary of state and attorney general in Arizona, CNN projected Wednesday. Blake Masters, the onetime venture capitalist, will secure the Republican nomination for US Senate, while Arizona Republicans have chosen state Rep. Mark Finchem, an election denier, as their nominee to take the helm of the state’s election machinery, CNN projects. And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN also projects. Masters will face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who was unopposed in his primary Tuesday, in what’s expected to be one of the nation’s most competitive, and expensive, midterm match-ups, with control of the 50-50 Senate on the line.  Masters was chief operating officer of GOP megadonor Peter Thiel’s investment firm, and his campaign was backed by more than $15 million in spending by Thiel.  Masters, who has spread lies about the results of the 2020 election and accused Democrats of trying to “change the demographics” of the country, defeated businessman Jim Lamon and Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, among others, in the GOP primary Tuesday. Finchem is aiming to be the chief elections officer in a state that conducts its voting largely by mail and has been the target of a series of conspiracy theories advanced by Trump and his allies, who falsely allege that the 2020 election was stolen from the former President. The Arizona secretary of state is the state’s second-highest executive elected official and first in line to succeed the governor, as the state does not have a lieutenant governor. Finchem was a member of the far-right “Oath Keepers” in 2014 and was an organizer of the “Stop the Steal” movement spurred by Trump’s lies about election fraud.  He’ll face the winner of the Democratic primary between Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes and state Rep. Reginald Bolding.  Finchem has said the state legislature should be able to overturn the will of voters in presidential elections – a position that, if embraced by Republicans after November’s election, could lead to a crisis in the 2024 election in one of the nation’s most competitive battleground states.  Finchem believes the legislature should be able to overturn voters’ will. Two other Republican candidates in the race supported stricter election laws but rejected the kinds of lies about election fraud that Finchem has advanced.",Mark Finchem;Reginald Bolding;Mark Brnovich;Adrian Fontes;Blake Masters;Mark Kelly;Peter Thiel;Jim Lamon,Us Senate;Us Senate;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,2432;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,39;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,327;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2204;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,39;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,327;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2204;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_OPERATING_OFFICER,733;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1549;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MARICOPA,1970;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,868;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,962;TAX_FNCACT_ELECTED_OFFICIAL,1661;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,158;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,1607;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2253;LEADER,78;LEADER,1575;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,78;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1575;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1661;TAX_ECON_PRICE,630;ELECTION_FRAUD,1903;ELECTION_FRAUD,2527;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1644;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1701;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1752;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_LIEUTENANT,1743;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT,1743;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,403;TAX_FNCACT_ORGANIZER,1829;TAX_FNCACT_BUSINESSMAN,1195;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1120;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,715;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,1339;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,1860;TRIAL,1224;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1224;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT_GOVERNOR,1752;CORRUPTION,1903;CORRUPTION,2527;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,1903;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,2527;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1903;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2527;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1903;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2527;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1903;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2527;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,1903;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,2527;USPEC_POLICY1,832;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,832;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,274;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2421;EXTREMISM,1792;LEGISLATION,2477;ELECTION,89;ELECTION,377;ELECTION,442;ELECTION,1100;ELECTION,1538;ELECTION,1897;ELECTION,2228;ELECTION,2271;ELECTION,2472;ELECTION,2521;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,733;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1357;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,733;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1357;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,149;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1598;",Kansas;Michigan;Arizona;Maricopa County;Washington;Missouri
625,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/asia/china-taiwan-pelosi-japan-tensions-intl-hnk/,"China pressed ahead with military drills near Taiwan and flew drones close to Japan on Friday, escalating tensions in the strait that have threatened to boil over since Taipei welcomed US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a historic visit. Taiwan’s defense ministry said Chinese warships and aircraft continued drills in waters around the island, adding that Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) forces crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China – in a move it called a “highly provocative act.”  The line has previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings and put air patrol forces, naval ships and shore-based missile systems on alert, the ministry added. Two Chinese drones also flew around Okinawa prefecture in Japan on Thursday, prompting the country’s Air Self-Defense Force to scramble fighter jets in response, according to a statement from Tokyo’s Ministry of Defense on Friday. In all, 49 planes entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ), Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. The ministry had previously suggested 68 aircraft flew into the area, but later clarified that 19 operated west of the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait. The moves comes as China doubles down on rhetoric blaming the US for spiking tensions and forcing it into a response. Beijing announced sanctions against Pelosi and her immediate family and said it would suspend cooperation with Washington on several issues, including fighting climate change, on Friday.  Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang said the island represented “freedom and democracy,” and that “the evil neighbor next door flexed its muscles on our doorstep and arbitrarily sabotaged (one of) the busiest waterways in the world with military exercises.” The skies and waters around Taiwan have become a focal point as Beijing ramps up tensions not only with Taiwan, but with neighboring Japan, which lodged a formal protest with China after five projectiles landed in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The missiles were among a number launched by Beijing Thursday – some of which flew over Taiwan – as Pelosi made her way to Tokyo where she met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday. China has previously fired missiles into waters surrounding Taiwan – a democratic island of 24 million that the Chinese Communist Party regards as its territory, despite having never controlled it – most notably during the Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 1990s. But missiles flying over the island marked a significant escalation, with US officials warning there may be more to come. “We anticipated that China might take steps like this – in fact, I described them for you in quite some detail just the other day,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We also expect that these actions will continue and that the Chinese will continue to react in the coming days.”  A US aircraft carrier will stay in the area around Taiwan for several more days to “monitor the situation,” Kirby added.  On Friday, Kishida said the Chinese military drills were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people” and called for an immediate halt to the exercises. Japan and the US would “work together to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he added. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday, Pelosi accused China of trying “to isolate Taiwan,” pointing to the island’s exclusion from international groups like the World Health Organization.  “They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” she said.  She added that her visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo, not changing it. Later on Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it was imposing sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family for “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs (and) seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Missiles posed ‘no risk’ China started military drills around the island on Thursday, firing multiple missiles toward waters near northeastern and southwestern Taiwan the day after Pelosi’s departure. A Chinese military expert confirmed on state broadcaster CCTV that the conventional missiles flew over Taiwan’s main island, including airspace covered by Taiwanese defense missiles. “We hit the targets under the observation of US Aegis combat system, which means the Chinese military has solved the difficulties of hitting long-range targets on waters,” said Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor of strategy at the National Defense University in Beijing. In a statement late Thursday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said the missiles had traveled above the atmosphere and therefore posed no risk to the island. Authorities did not trigger air raid alerts because they predicted the missiles would land in waters east of Taiwan, the ministry said. The ministry added it would not release further information about the missiles’ trajectory to protect its intelligence-gathering capabilities. Five ballistic missiles are believed to have landed within Japan’s EEZ, including four believed to have flown over Taiwan, said Japan’s Defense Ministry on Thursday.  “This is a serious problem that concerns Japan’s security and the safety of its citizens. We strongly condemn it,” Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters during a news conference. China also sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Thursday – all of which crossed the median line. It follows similar Chinese incursions a day earlier across the median line.  Thursday’s incursions were made by 12 Su-30 fighter jets, eight J-11 fighter jets, and two J-16 fighter jets, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Later Thursday, the ministry said it detected four drones flying over “restricted waters” around the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands near mainland China. The ministry said Taiwan’s military fired flares to warn the drones away, but did not specify the type or origin of the devices. On Friday, a spokesperson from Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said the government’s English website and the ministry website had both detected a large number of attacks on Tuesday – the day Pelosi landed in Taiwan. The IP addresses behind the attacks came from China and Russia, among other locations, with the intention of paralyzing the government sites, said the spokesperson.  She added that the websites were back to normal after emergency repair work, but “massive attacks with malicious intent .. by overseas hostile forces” continued on Thursday and Friday.  Disruptions to trade In a speech on Thursday, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen condemned China’s military drills as “irresponsible,” saying they marked a “deliberate and continuous escalation of military threats.” “I must emphasize that, we do not seek to escalate conflicts or provoke disputes, but we will firmly defend our sovereignty and national safety, as well as safeguarding democracy and freedom,” she added. She also thanked the Group of Seven, comprised of the world’s largest economies, which released a statement on Wednesday voicing concern over China’s live-fire exercises and urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. The exercises have also caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, with some international flights canceled and vessels urged to use alternative routes for several ports around the island. On Tuesday, the Chinese Defense Ministry said it would hold its exercises in six zones around Taiwan, warning ships and aircraft to stay out of the areas during the drills. The Taiwan Strait is a key trade route for vessels carrying goods between major economies in northeast Asia such as China, Japan, and South Korea, and the rest of world.

238,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/tech/crypto-bridge-hack-nomad/,"Heists continue to plague the crypto world, with news of large sums stolen from digital currency firms seemingly every month. But while crypto exchanges were once the main point of attack, hackers now appear to have a new target: blockchain bridges. Bridges are the infrastructure that allow users to exchange assets between different blockchains, the digital database underpinning major cryptocurrencies. When a bridge service swaps one coin for another, it “wraps” the currency so that it will function on the other blockchain. A wrapped coin does not become another currency altogether – “it just looks like it,” Tom Robinson, chief scientist at blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, told CNN Business. Instead, a “token” is issued to represent the new coin on the different blockchain. “I deposit my Bitcoin in the bridge. In return for doing that, I receive a Bitcoin token on the Ethereum blockchain, and then I can transfer that Bitcoin token, which is what is known as a wrapped asset, through the Ethereum blockchain,” explains Robinson.  To support these wrapped coins, bridge services hold large reserves of various coins. “You need to trust the bridge really has the assets that are backing those tokens,” said Robinson. “They have huge amounts of assets that back those wrapped tokens.” These coin reserves are attracting the attention of hackers and turning blockchain bridges into prime targets for heists, according to Elliptic. “They’re just huge honeypots. They just hold huge amounts of crypto assets, and so they are very obvious targets,” said Robinson.  Some $1.83 billion has been stolen from bridges to date, with the majority of that ($1.21 billion) taking place just this year, according to Elliptic. Six major bridges have been hit in thefts so far in 2022, including California-based firm Harmony, which lost $100 million in late June, and Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge, which suffered a $625 million theft in March. In the latest example, hackers reportedly stole cryptocurrency valued at $190 million from cryptocurrency bridge provider Nomad, according to blockchain security and data analytics company Peckshield. (Nomad has not confirmed the total amount lost.)  “We are working around the clock to address the situation and have notified law enforcement and retained leading firms for blockchain intelligence and forensics,” Nomad tweeted Tuesday. “Our goal is to identify the accounts involved and to trace and recover the funds.” Nomad is working with chain analysis firm TRM labs to help trace funds  in an effort to return stolen money to users, according to a tweet posted by Nomad on Wednesday. Nomad first tweeted late Monday addressing the incident and said that it was “aware of impersonators posing as Nomad and providing fraudulent addresses to collect funds.” According to Peckshield, Nomad’s system was drained gradually in batches, and stolen coins included ether and some stablecoins linked to the US dollar. A researcher at crypto investment firm Paradigm tweeted that the exploit was “one of the most chaotic hacks that Web3 has ever seen.” Just days before the incident, Nomad revealed several big name investors – including Coinbase Ventures, OpenSea and Crypto.com Capital – that took part in an April funding round for $22 million to “help grow security-first cross-chain messaging solution.” The growing number of bridge attacks only adds to security and trust concerns in the crypto industry. Several of the largest crypto thefts of all time took place just last year, amid a surge in crypto prices and usage. Cryptocurrency prices have since fallen considerably but remains a potentially lucrative target.  Crypto scams have also become popular, with scammers stealing more than $1 billion from the start of 2021 through March of this year, according to a report in June from the Federal Trade Commission.  “Certain features of cryptocurrency may explain why it’s a pet payment method for crooks and cons,” the FTC said in a release at the time. “There’s no bank or other entity to flag suspicious transactions before they happen. Crypto transfers can’t be reversed. Once the money’s gone, you can kiss your crypto buh-bye.” Additional reporting by CNN’s Sean Lyngaas and Ramishah Maruf.",Ramishah Maruf;Tom Robinson;Sean Lyngaas,Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,3061;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,394;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,394;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,394;WB_2945_DATABASE,394;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,394;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_US_DOLLAR,3061;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,97;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1750;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2678;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2997;TAX_FNCACT_RESEARCHER,3075;MARITIME_INCIDENT,271;MARITIME_INCIDENT,282;MARITIME_INCIDENT,1519;MARITIME_INCIDENT,1763;MARITIME_INCIDENT,1882;MARITIME,271;MARITIME,282;MARITIME,1519;MARITIME,1763;MARITIME,1882;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,271;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,282;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1519;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1763;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1882;ECON_BITCOIN,430;CYBER_ATTACK,218;CYBER_ATTACK,1490;CYBER_ATTACK,2105;TAX_FNCACT_HACKERS,218;TAX_FNCACT_HACKERS,1490;TAX_FNCACT_HACKERS,2105;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,658;SCIENCE,668;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,668;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3632;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3663;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,725;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,208;WB_698_TRADE,3916;SECURITY_SERVICES,2408;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2408;WB_840_JUSTICE,2408;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2408;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,2408;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,2408;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,2408;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,3927;TAX_DISEASE_PLAGUE,47;LEGISLATION,2396;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2396;",New York

The trio then sued in DC District Court to challenge the House rules. But Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, on Monday dismissed the case, saying he did not have jurisdiction. The House sergeant at arms and the House’s top administrator were protected from the court wading into the House rules because of the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause, the judge determined.  “Here, each challenged act of the House Officers qualifies as a legislative act,” Kelly wrote. “Thus, the Speech or Debate Clause bars the Members’ claims.”",Louie Gohmert;Timothy Kelly;Andrew Clyde;Lloyd Smucker,Dc District Court,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,56;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,56;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,270;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,610;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,270;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,610;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,640;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,380;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,824;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,824;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT,262;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT,602;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT,262;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT,602;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,20;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,479;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,761;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,88;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,298;TRIAL,418;CONSTITUTIONAL,726;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,138;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,138;TAX_FNCACT_APPOINTEE,513;",Georgia;Pennsylvania;Texas
684,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/world/greenland-melting-mineral-mining-climate/,"Some of the world’s richest men are funding a massive treasure hunt, complete with helicopters and transmitters, on the west coast of Greenland. The climate crisis is melting Greenland down at an unprecedented rate, which – in a twist of irony – is creating an opportunity for investors and mining companies who are searching for a trove of critical minerals capable of powering the green energy transition.  A band of billionaires, including Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates, among others, is betting that below the surface of the hills and valleys on Greenland’s Disko Island and Nuussuaq Peninsula there are enough critical minerals to power hundreds of millions of electric vehicles.   “We are looking for a deposit that will be the first- or second-largest most significant nickel and cobalt deposit in the world,” Kurt House, CEO of Kobold Metals, told CNN. The Arctic’s disappearing ice – on land and in the ocean – highlights a unique dichotomy: Greenland is ground zero for the impacts of climate change, but it could also become ground zero for sourcing the metals needed to power the solution to the crisis. The billionaire club is financially backing Kobold Metals, a mineral exploration company and California-based startup, the company’s representatives told CNN. Bezos, Bloomberg and Gates did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on this story. Kobold is partnered with Bluejay Mining to find the rare and precious metals in Greenland that are necessary to build electric vehicles and massive batteries to store renewable energy.  Thirty geologists, geophysicists, cooks, pilots and mechanics are camped at the site where Kobold and Blujay are searching for the buried treasure. CNN is the first media outlet with video of the activity happening there.    Crews are taking soil samples, flying drones and helicopters with transmitters to measure the electromagnetic field of the subsurface and map the layers of rock below. They’re using artificial intelligence to analyze the data to pinpoint exactly where to drill as early as next summer. “It is a concern to witness the consequences and impacts from the climate changes in Greenland,” Bluejay Mining CEO Bo Møller Stensgaard told CNN. “But, generally speaking, climate changes overall have made exploration and mining in Greenland easier and more accessible.”  Stensgaard said that because climate change is making ice-free periods in the sea longer, teams are able to ship in heavy equipment and ship out metals out to the global market more easily.   Melting land ice is exposing land that has been buried under ice for centuries to millennia – but could now become a potential site for mineral exploration.  “As these trends continue well into the future, there is no question more land will become accessible and some of this land may carry the potential for mineral development,” Mike Sfraga, the chair of the United States Arctic Research Commission, told CNN. Greenland could be a hot spot for coal, copper, gold, rare-earth elements and zinc, according to the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. The government of Greenland, according to the agency, has done several “resource assessments throughout the ice-free land” and the government “recognizes the country’s potential to diversify the national economy through mineral extraction.” Sfraga said that pro-mining stance is not without regard for the environment, which is central to Greenland’s culture and livelihood.  “The government of Greenland supports the responsible, sustainable, and economically viable development of their natural resources to include mining of a broad range of minerals,” Sfraga said.  Stensgaard noted that these critical minerals will “provide part of the solution to meet these challenges” that the climate crisis presents. In the meantime, Greenland’s vanishing ice – which is pushing sea level higher – is a great concern for scientists who study the Arctic. “The big concern for Arctic sea ice is that it’s been disappearing over the last several decades its predicted to potentially disappear in 20 to 30 years,” Nathan Kurtz, a NASA scientist who studies sea ice, told CNN. “In the fall, what used to be Artic ice cover year-round is now just going to be seasonal ice cover.”",Nathan Kurtz;Mike Sfraga;Michael Bloomberg;Bill Gates;Jeff Bezos,Bloomberg;Bloomberg;Geological Survey Of Denmark;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States Arctic Research Commission,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3516;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3640;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3883;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3516;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3640;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3883;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2904;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1965;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1965;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1965;ENV_METALS,1036;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,1036;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,1036;WB_2935_NICKEL,1036;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,1036;WB_525_RENEWABLE_ENERGY,1796;TAX_WORLDBIRDS_BLUEJAY,1649;TAX_WORLDBIRDS_BLUEJAY,2470;TAX_WORLDBIRDS_BLUEJAY,4072;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,2041;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVES,1521;ENV_MINING,328;ENV_MINING,1656;ENV_MINING,2477;ENV_MINING,2598;ENV_MINING,2895;ENV_MINING,4016;ENV_MINING,4079;SLFID_MINERAL_RESOURCES,1457;SLFID_MINERAL_RESOURCES,3096;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,1255;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,2682;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,192;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,785;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,889;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1248;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2439;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2551;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2675;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4272;SLFID_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3998;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,3998;WB_1078_DETERMINANTS_OF_GROWTH,3998;WB_1079_COMMODITIES_AND_RESOURCES,3998;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,1144;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2844;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2961;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,3009;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4333;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4460;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4620;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4672;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4725;SCIENCE,4600;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,4600;USPEC_POLICY1,3707;EPU_ECONOMY,3707;TAX_FNCACT_MECHANICS,1858;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1085;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2481;DRONES,2130;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2384;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,4386;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,4441;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,199;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1356;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,4279;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEE,4088;WB_896_GEOLOGICAL_MAPPING_AND_DATABASES,3477;WB_2286_GEOLOGICAL_SURVEY,3477;ENV_GREEN,426;ENV_COAL,3396;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILL,2341;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,199;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,4279;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,199;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,4279;",Nevada;Nuussuaq;United States;Denmark;Greenland
281,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/ayman-al-zawahiri-death-white-house-joe-biden/,"Before he gave the order to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri, President Joe Biden wanted to intimately understand where the al Qaeda leader was hiding. The US drone strike that killed Zawahiri on his balcony in downtown Kabul was the product of months of highly secret planning by Biden and a tight circle of his senior advisers. Among the preparations was a small-scale model of Zawahiri’s safe house, constructed by intelligence officials and placed inside the White House Situation Room for Biden to examine as he debated his options. For Biden, the opportunity to take out the world’s most wanted terrorist, one of the masterminds of the September, 11, 2001, attacks, was fraught with the risk of accidentally killing civilians in the Afghan capital — just as a US drone strike did 11 months ago during the chaotic US military withdrawal from the country.  Details of the strike and its planning were disclosed by a senior administration official as Biden was preparing to announce the mission Monday. Throughout the months-long effort to plan this weekend’s strike, Biden repeatedly tasked his officials with ensuring civilians – including members of Zawahiri’s family – weren’t killed. None were, according to the White House. Biden, who was isolating due to a Covid-19 infection during the final deliberations and authorization of the strike, emerged to proclaim success on a White House balcony Monday. It was a moment of victory for a President who has been besieged by domestic political troubles that stretch back to the deadly Afghanistan withdrawal a year ago. “People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer. The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm,” Biden said from the Blue Room Balcony of the White House.  The President was first briefed in April on US intelligence placing Zawahiri at a safe house in Kabul. American officials had been aware of a network supporting the terrorist leader in the Afghan capital for months, and had identified his wife, daughter and her children through multiple streams of intelligence. The women utilized terrorist “tradecraft” that officials deemed designed to prevent anyone from following them to Zawahiri’s location in a Kabul neighborhood. Zawahiri himself didn’t leave the location after his arrival this year. As the months wore on, US officials began to establish patterns at the house — including Zawahiri emerging periodically onto the home’s balcony for sustained periods of time.  As officials continued to monitor his activities, an effort began in complete secret to analyze the building’s construction and structure, with an eye toward developing an operation to take out the world’s No. 1 terrorist target without compromising the building’s structural integrity. At top of mind for Biden and members of his team was avoiding civilian deaths, including the members of Zawahiri’s family who were living in the building. Independent analysts from across the government were involved in identifying the other occupants of the house.  That the building was located in downtown Kabul presented its own challenges.  Surrounded by a residential neighborhood, officials were mindful their planning and information needed to be “rock solid” before presenting any options to Biden. And they were highly wary of leaks – only a “very small and select group” at a scattering of key agencies were informed of the plans being laid. Biden was also concerned about how it might affect US efforts to secure the return of Mark Frerichs, an American citizen taken hostage in Afghanistan more than two years ago. A senior administration official said Biden pressed his team to mitigate risks to those efforts, along with the ongoing attempts to relocate Afghans who helped the US during the war. “Going forward with the Taliban, we will continue to hold them accountable for their actions. And we have made clear to them in the intervening days that we also expect them to take no action that would harm Mark Frerichs, as we were involved in the effort to secure his release after his long detention and captivity,” the official said. As May and June wore on, Biden was kept abreast of the developments. On July 1, he gathered key national security officials in the White House Situation Room to receive a briefing on a proposed operation. CIA Director Bill Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his deputy Jon Finer, and Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood Randall sat around the table.  Biden was “deeply engaged in the briefing and immersed in the intelligence,” a senior official said. He asked “detailed questions about what we knew and how we knew it.” Of particular interest was a scale model of Zawahiri’s house that intelligence officials had constructed and brought into the White House for the President to examine. Biden questioned how the house might be lit by the sun, its construction materials and how the weather could affect any operation, the official said. “He was particularly focused on ensuring that every step had been taken to ensure the operation would minimize that risk” of civilian casualties, according to the official. Biden asked his team for more information about the building’s plans and how a strike might affect it. He flew to Camp David later that afternoon. His team remained behind, convening multiple times in the Situation Room over the next weeks to complete their planning, answer the President’s questions and ensure they’d taken every contingency to minimize risks.  A parallel effort by senior administration lawyers was underway to examine the intelligence related to Zawahiri and establish the legal basis for the operation.  On July 25 – as he was isolating with Covid-19 in the White House residence – Biden brought his team back together to receive a final briefing. He again pressed at a “granular level,” the official said, asking about any additional options that could minimize civilian casualties. He asked about the layout of the house – where the rooms were positioned behind windows and doors on the third floor – and what potential effect the strike would have. And he went around his team, asking each official’s view. At the end, he authorized a “precise tailored airstrike” to take out the target. Five days later, two Hellfire missiles were fired into the balcony of the safe house in Kabul at 6:18 a.m. local time. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day” that the US has “visual confirmation” as well as confirmation from “other sources and methods,” but not DNA confirmation, that the strike hit its intended target. Members of his family, who were in other areas of the home, were unharmed, the official said. Biden, still isolating in the White House residence with a rebound Covid infection, was informed when the operation began and when it concluded.

534,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-fbi-search-analysis/,"The FBI’s search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday makes one thing crystal clear: The legal vise is tightening around the former President even as he weighs whether to run for president again in 2024. “My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his preferred social network, on Monday evening. He added that “they even broke into my safe.” Agents appear to be focused on the area of the sprawling estate where Trump’s living quarters and offices are located. It was not immediately clear what the FBI was after – or what, specifically, the agents were looking for. Boxes of items were taken during the search, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. We do know that federal investigators issued a subpoena to the National Archives and Records Administration in May for access to classified documents that were taken to Trump’s home in Florida – part of a grand jury investigation into whether Trump or anyone else close to him mishandled classified documents that he took with him after leaving the White House last January.  Earlier this year, 15 boxes of White House records that Trump had brought to Mar-a-Lago were retrieved and returned to the National Archives. Among the items in the returned boxes included letters from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and former President Barack Obama. The FBI search also comes on the same day that The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman revealed photos of torn-up notes appearing to bear Trump’s distinctive penmanship in toilets – one of which was in the White House.   That’s consistent with this CNN reporting from mid-February: “Three former White House officials told CNN they saw Trump, on numerous occasions, manually destroy papers he was no longer interested in or had finished reviewing – a practice that made it difficult for White House staff secretaries to preserve presidential records. Those officials said the former President sorted through file boxes in a rather methodical way – tearing up newspaper clippings or drafts of tweets that he had rejected and tossing them to the floor, or stacking papers he wished to hang on to in a disorderly stack atop his desk.” Disposing of notes, emails and other forms of presidential communication is against federal law as laid out in the Presidential Records Act. (Under the Act, all correspondence of a president is owned, ultimately, by the public.) The FBI’s execution of a search warrant also comes just days after the news broke that lawyers for Trump are in touch with the Justice Department in regards to its ongoing investigation into the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. As CNN first reported: “The talks revolve around whether Trump would be able to shield conversations he had while he was president from federal investigators. “In recent weeks, investigators have moved aggressively into Trump’s orbit, subpoenaing top former White House officials, focusing on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and executing searches of lawyers who sought to aid those efforts.” Trump, CNN has also reported, has quizzed his legal team of late as to whether he might be indicted, although he himself is skeptical it will come to that. (Worth noting: Trump is not a lawyer.) The series of developments – culminating with the high-profile search of Trump’s home on Monday – reinforce a fundamental fact of Trump’s situation: He is far more likely to see a 2024 run for president curtailed by legal problems than political ones. Politically, Trump remains the 800-pound gorilla in the Republican field. Over the weekend, he convincingly won a straw poll at a conservative gathering in Texas. And, he has all but announced his intention to run again, with the major question at this point being when he will announce his candidacy – not whether he will do so. Trump posted a campaign-style video on his Truth Social site Tuesday morning, saying “the best is yet to come.” Trump’s mounting legal woes – or at least the clear sense that this variety of investigations is getting closer and closer to him – complicate all of that. Trump under legal fire is one thing for Republicans to accept. Trump under indictment is something else entirely. We are, of course, not there yet. But, Monday’s FBI activity suggests that Trump’s legal problems are likely to get worse before they get better. And they may get way, way worse. This story has been updated with additional information.

The worker is in isolation and is “doing well.” The day-care center has also been cleaned. Vohra said the US Food and Drug Administration has made the monkeypox vaccine available for the children “without jumping through the normal hoops in this process,” so parents of children exposed to the virus can get their kids vaccinated.  “Pediatricians are on-site as we speak to screen children for cases, and there are mobile testing and vaccines for their families,” he said. The day-care worker also works in home health care, and public health officials are in contact with an affected client. Public health officials asked parents to let disease investigators contact them if their child is affected. “If your child has had the potential of being exposed to this outbreak, you will receive a call from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. You do not need to call day-care centers. You do not need to call public health. You will be contacted,” said Julie Pryde, administrator of the district.  Monkeypox spreads primarily through extended skin-on-skin contact or through contact with contaminated items.  Some cases in the United States have been reported in women and children in the ongoing outbreak, but the virus has been predominantly found in gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men. There are more than 7,500 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in the United States as of Friday afternoon, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Sameer Vohra;Julie Pryde;Sanjay Gupta,Champaign-Urbana Public Health District;Us Centers For Disease;Drug Administration;Illinois Department Of Public Health;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,302;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1293;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,2239;WB_1406_DISEASES,1293;WB_1406_DISEASES,2239;HEALTH_VACCINATION,643;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,643;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,643;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,643;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,643;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1335;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1364;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,31;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,491;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,1139;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2260;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2260;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2260;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2260;WB_2026_PREVENTION,2260;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,108;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1188;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1254;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1486;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1575;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,108;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1188;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1254;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1486;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1575;GENERAL_HEALTH,108;GENERAL_HEALTH,1165;GENERAL_HEALTH,1188;GENERAL_HEALTH,1254;GENERAL_HEALTH,1486;GENERAL_HEALTH,1575;GENERAL_HEALTH,1667;GENERAL_HEALTH,1782;MEDICAL,108;MEDICAL,1165;MEDICAL,1188;MEDICAL,1254;MEDICAL,1486;MEDICAL,1575;MEDICAL,1667;MEDICAL,1782;AFFECT,1230;AFFECT,1347;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1959;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1420;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1994;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1420;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1994;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1420;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1994;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1420;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1994;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,1633;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,597;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,597;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,597;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,597;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,597;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,597;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1307;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,65;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,280;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,635;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,824;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,905;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1800;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2147;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,1170;LGBT,2044;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,412;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1198;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1264;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,366;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,442;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,670;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,752;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1026;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1970;",Illinois;Rantoul;United States
278,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/us/uvalde-texas-governor-meets-families/,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott met privately Monday with some families in Uvalde, discussing school safety, a teacher who was also there told CNN. Robb Elementary School teacher Arnulfo Reyes expressed his skepticism of the governor’s visit to the town, where questions and frustrations remain over the official response to the May 24 massacre that left 19 students and two teachers dead. Reyes said he and Abbott spoke in person Monday morning after the governor’s office reached out to him last week.  “I felt like it was just a political thing, I don’t think they cared,” Reyes said, when asked how he felt about the governor reaching out. “I think it was just it’s all for show. … If he would have cared, he wouldn’t have done the NRA (convention) in Houston after our tragedy.” Abbott canceled an in-person appearance at the NRA convention on May 27 but did release a video message that was played in the arena. He instead attended a news conference in Uvalde.  Reyes said he asked the governor why the state’s minimum age to buy a firearm hasn’t been raised from 18 to 21. In Texas, people 18 and older may buy long guns and buyers who are at least 21 can purchase a handgun from a licensed dealer. The gunman in Uvalde bought two semi-automatic rifles around the time of his 18th birthday.  “I asked him about the age limit … why do we still have it at 18? Why couldn’t it be moved to 21?” Reyes said. “He said that they had found it unconstitutional to change the age or something like that.” Abbott’s office, when asked for comment about Reyes’ description of the conversations, said, “Governor Abbott is meeting privately with victims’ families. Out of respect to these families who are still grieving, the discussions will remain private.” Abbott has met with more than two dozen families in Uvalde and will continue talking to families, according to a statement from Abbott spokesperson Ranae Eze.  Reyes told CNN that Abbott met Monday with several families, including the mothers of Tess Mata and Eliahna Garcia, who were both killed at the school. Abbott said he plans to make sure that all schools are safe before the school year begins and claimed Uvalde schools would now be more secure than others, according to Reyes. At a meeting last week, the Uvalde school board announced it plans to improve school security, including hiring additional officers for the district police force, which had five members on the day of the shooting. Parents and other community members voiced their frustration at the meeting about what they called a lack of transparency on the part of the board over what will be done to make their children feel safe going back to school. The school calendar has been pushed back to implement some of the security upgrades, officials have said. Friends of NRA event loses fundraiser site near Uvalde In Hondo, Texas, less than an hour’s drive east of Uvalde, a spirited city council meeting was held Monday during which members voted 4-1 to revoke a rental agreement for a Friends of the NRA fundraiser that was set to be held Saturday at a city-owned facility. The decision was made after several relatives of Robb Elementary shooting victims spoke out during the meeting.  Nikki Cross, a relative of Uziyah Garcia, who was among the students killed, said, “I am not here protesting the NRA or anything like that. I am just here asking your community to take into consideration it’s only been two months for us.” Jazmin Cazares, whose sister Jackie died in the Uvalde shooting, addressed council members, naming each victim of the massacre. “It is a slap in the face to all of Uvalde, especially the ones that lost a loved one, some of us being here today. What’s an even harder slap in the face is the AR-15 you get if you donate $5,000 to the NRA,” she said. The Hondo event information page for reserved table packages says a $5,000 donation gets the buyer a table for eight, some Friends of the NRA merchandise and a choice of a Daniel Defense AR-15-style rifle or a shotgun. “What happened to love thy neighbor? Is that not a thing here? The specific gun that they are giving away in this, what if that falls into the hands of another angry 18-year-old?” Cross said, referring to the Uvalde gunman who used a Daniel Defense firearm. “Then it could be your children that are at risk and we would stand with you. I am just asking that you postpone it. Give us time to grieve. We are going through enough already.”  Friends of the NRA is affiliated with the NRA but is a separate entity. According to its website, it is a fundraising program under the NRA Foundation and promotes shooting sports. Sandy Steubing, a Hondo resident and volunteer with the the event, told the council: “All the Friends of NRA Foundation does is raise funds in furtherance of their charitable and educational mission.”",Arnulfo Reyes;Tess Mata;Eliahna Garcia;Greg Abbott;Ranae Eze,Robb Elementary School;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,549;EDUCATION,108;EDUCATION,181;EDUCATION,1945;EDUCATION,2026;EDUCATION,2197;EDUCATION,2240;EDUCATION,2589;EDUCATION,2603;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,108;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,181;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1945;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2026;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2197;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2240;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2589;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2603;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,108;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,181;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1945;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2026;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2197;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2240;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2589;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2603;DELAY,824;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1781;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,127;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,204;LEADER,259;LEADER,474;LEADER,638;LEADER,1032;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,259;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,474;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,638;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1032;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2249;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2667;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,380;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,1999;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,2078;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,398;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,398;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,398;TAX_WEAPONS_GUNS,1155;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,660;TAX_WEAPONS_FIREARM,1075;TAX_FNCACT_DEALER,1230;KILL,358;TERROR,358;ARMEDCONFLICT,358;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,2288;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,2288;TRANSPARENCY,2490;SECURITY_SERVICES,2312;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2312;CONSTITUTIONAL,1497;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2688;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2558;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,332;",Robb Elementary School;Uvalde;Houston;Texas
116,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/business/drug-stores-locked-products/,"These days, it feels like many stores are fortresses.  Most of the products on the drug store shelf are behind lock and key, even everyday items such as deodorant, toothpaste, candy, dish detergent, soap and aluminum foil. Manufacturers that supply lock cases and devices to chain stores have seen their businesses boom. Walgreens and Rite Aid have said that the problem of organized retail crime – rings of criminals that steal products from stores and then often resell them on online marketplaces – is causing them to lock more products up and close some stores.  Locking up their shelves is a last resort for stores, but it has never been more widely practiced. It’s also become a growing irritation for shoppers and a source of frustration for some employees who must walk around the store with keys at the ready. “It’s extremely discouraging to customers,” said Paco Underhill, the founder of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “It is a brutal experience for the merchant, too.” The reason why stores resort to locking up these products is simple: to prevent shoplifting. But these decisions are far more nuanced and fraught for stores than you may think. Companies must walk a delicate line between protecting their inventory and creating stores that customers don’t dread visiting. Shoplifting in America  Until the early 20th century, locking up products was the norm. When customers visited a store, clerks would provide them with the items they wanted from behind a counter. This changed as the first self-service stores like Piggly Wiggly in the early 20th century discovered they could sell more goods and reduce their costs by spreading out merchandise on an open sales floor.  While having fewer workers in the store increased profits for chains in recent decades, it has left stores in some cases without as many visible personnel to deter shoplifting, crime prevention experts say.  Shoplifting has been around for centuries, but it “came of age in America in 1965,” author Rachel Shteir writes in “The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting.” The FBI in 1965 reported that it had jumped 93% in the prior five years and “was the nation’s fastest-growing form of larceny.” Three years later, officials around the country said there had been an additional surge in young teenagers shoplifting. The trend became part of the counterculture, as exemplified by Abbie Hoffman’s 1971 “Steal This Book.” In response, an anti-shoplifting industry and corporate “loss prevention” (LP) and “asset protection” (AP) teams sprang up. Technologies also emerged such as closed-circuit TV cameras, electronic article surveillance and anti-theft tags. ‘Hot products’ Stores look to protect “the vital few” products that are most profitable for them to sell, said Adrian Beck, who studies retail losses at the University of Leicester. And they’re willing to accept higher theft on the lower-margin “trivial many,” he added.  Shoplifters target smaller items with higher price tags, often called “hot products,” which typically are what retailers most frequently lock up. One criminologist created an apt acronym, CRAVED, to predict the stuff at highest risk: “concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable.”   The most commonly stolen items at US stores include cigarettes, health and beauty products, over-the-counter medications, contraceptives, liquor, teeth-whitening strips and other products. Drug stores have a higher proportion of the items that are “hot products,” so they have more stuff under lock and key than other retail formats, Beck said. Organized retail crime There is only so much that can be done to to stop shoplifting. Companies prohibit retail staff from physically trying to stop a shoplifter for their own safety and must find other ways to protect the merchandise.  These include measures such as security tags on items that set off alarms when someone walks out without paying. But this is less valuable than it used to be because alarms have become part of the general cacophony of store noise and often go ignored.  Stores also use strategies such as shelves that allow a customer to take only one item at a time. This helps prevent shoppers emptying an entire shelf of products. Locking up a product is the final step a retailer will take before removing it altogether, and stores say they are resorting to this measure more frequently as theft continues to increase.  There is no national database on shoplifting, which often goes under-reported, and stores and prosecutors rarely press charges.   Retailers say organized retail crime has made their theft problems only worse. Crime gangs often look to steal products from stores that can easily and quickly be resold on online marketplaces such as Amazon and through illicit markets. “More products today are locked up because the problem has gotten so much bigger,” said Lisa LaBruno, the senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “Criminal actors can steal high volumes of products and sell them with anonymity.” Retailers have supported a bipartisan bill that would require online marketplaces to verify state-issued IDs for millions of high-volume third-party sellers. President Joe Biden supports such a measure and this week also called on Congress to impose liability on online marketplaces that sell stolen goods on their platforms. Amazon said it does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods and works closely with law enforcement, retailers and other partners to stop bad actors. “We regularly request invoices, purchase orders, or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products,” a spokesperson said. Irritated customers and lost sales Unfortunately, many of these time-consuming anti-theft measures wind up irritating customers and cut into sales. One anti-theft device company’s CEO told Forbes that locked up stuff can result in sales reductions of 15% to 25%. Shoppers today are more impatient. Some will walk out and buy the product on Amazon instead of hanging around for a worker. “You’re trying to be as frictionless for the customer but still prevent the loss,” said Mark Stinde, a former vice president of asset protection for Kroger and other large retailers. “You get a lot of pushback from operations and merchandising teams for locking stuff up.” Stores are working on new ways to lock up products while reducing customer frustration, such as a new type of case that any employee can open with a smartphone. Other cases require shoppers to enter their phone number to open or scan a QR code. “Consumers understand why you have to lock up a fur coat or jewelry. But they say ‘why are we locking up deodorant?’” said Jack Trlica, co-founder of trade publication LP Magazine.  Trlica expects companies will develop new technologies that protect products but don’t require flagging down an employee to unlock a shelf. “There’s going to be an evolution of security products,” he said.

228,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/business-food/oreo-pumpkin-spice-cookie-return-date/,"Fall doesn’t start for seven more weeks, but it has already begun for Oreo. Oreo’s “Pumpkin Spice Sandwich Cookies” are hitting store shelves on August 15, marking their return following a five-year hiatus. The limited-edition flavor features two golden Oreo cookies with a “festive pumpkin spice flavored cream” sandwiched in the middle.  Pumpkin-flavored items have become synonymous with fall, with companies launching them in August to capture the excitement. Bud Light Seltzer and Samuel Adams beer have pumpkin-flavored beverages, Cup Noodles sells pumpkin-flavored ramen and both Starbucks and Dunkin’ infuse the flavor into drinks every year. Seasonal items are an important marketing tool for the food industry, according to Alexander Chernev, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. For food brands, which rely on familiarity, holiday items can offer consumers some variety. “You need consistency because that’s the brand mantra,” Chernev previously told CNN Business. “But no matter how much you like something, consuming something different … increases the enjoyment of what you consumed before.” Oreo regularly releases limited time flavors to spark customer excitement, such as chocolate confetti cake for its birthday and a Lady Gaga flavor. Owned by Mondelez\n            \n                (MDLZ), the 110-year-old Oreo brand continues to grow. Releasing unique flavors is part of the company’s goal to increase sales of the brand by $1 billion in the next year.  The company recently announced it’s divesting its gum business, including Dentyne and Trident, in developed markets like North America and parts of Europe.

478,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/more-skeletal-remains-at-lake-mead/,"More human remains have been found in the receding waters of Lake Mead, authorities announced Saturday. This is the fourth time human remains have been found at Lake Mead National Recreation Area since May. In the latest incident, park rangers got a call Saturday morning about skeletal remains at Swim Beach area,  National Park Service officials said in a statement.  Rangers set up a perimeter at the beach to recover the remains with help from divers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, according to the Park Service. A coroner was also called to determine the cause of death.    At least three different sets have previously been found at the lake, where water levels have plunged to unprecedented lows amid an unrelenting water crisis in the West. The previous remains discovered, including a body that was found in a corroding barrel with a gunshot wound, were in advanced stages of decomposition and thus difficult to extract DNA from, officials said.  It’s unclear how long the latest remains found have been in the lake. The homicide division of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police is not currently handling the investigation, Lt. Jason Johansson told CNN. The police department is, however, leading the investigation into a different body, one found in the barrel on the lake’s Hemenway Harbor on May 1. The body had an obvious gunshot wound and investigators immediately treated it as a homicide investigation, Johansson previously told CNN. “Anytime you have a body in a barrel, clearly there was somebody else involved,” he said.  Since then, Clark County Coroner Melanie Rouse has preliminarily ruled the cause and manner of death a homicide by gunshot. The remains, dubbed Hemenway Harbor Doe by the coroner’s office, belonged to someone who died in the mid-’70s to early ‘80s, according to police. A second set of remains – found on May 7 at Calville Bay – are believed to belong to someone who was approximately between ages 23 and 37, according to Rouse. It’s unclear how that person died. The Calville Bay remains are more skeletal than the other two sets, which both still have organ tissue available for examination, Rouse said.  A third set of remains – found at the lake’s Swim Beach on July 25 – are only partial and are still at early stages of examination, according to Rouse.  The lake straddles the border of Nevada and Arizona. While the grim discoveries in the shrinking lake quickly generated theories of mob involvement, Johansson said those ideas are “mere speculation” at this point in the investigation. A National Park Service spokesperson told CNN one possible explanation for the remains could be that they belong to people who previously drowned at the lake when water levels used to be high. At its height in ’80s, Lake Mead – the largest manmade reservoir in the country – was 1,225 feet above sea level. But as the mega-drought persists, water levels have plunged this year to the lowest level since the reservoir was filled in the 1930s. Lake Mead was filled to just 27% of capacity as of July 18, 2022, according to NASA. Water levels have plummeted so much that, in addition to several bodies, they have exposed a sunken World War II-era vessel, the Park Service announced in early July.

274,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/us/kentucky-flooding-california-wildfires-drought-climate,"Extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum has thrashed parts of the US over the past week – one of the many signals that climate change is here now, scientists say. On the one hand, overwhelming rainfall triggered two ultra-rare floods last week, one in the St. Louis area and another in eastern Kentucky that has left dozens dead or missing. On the other, a fiery drought has fueled California’s largest wildfire of the year so far – the McKinney Fire – which burned so hot over the weekend that massive pyrocumulus clouds erupted into the atmosphere. Expect more of these extremes as the planet warms, said Kevin Reed, a climate scientist at Stony Brook University, and prepare for them. “Every weather event has some flavor of climate change in it because it’s impossible to decouple them,” Reed told CNN. “It’s another sign that climate change is here. It’s not just a challenge for the next 400 years from now or 50 years from now; in reality, it’s something that we need to rapidly adjust to, adapt to and become more resilient to now.”  Climate experts anticipate heavy rain events to increase in intensity and frequency as the planet warms, since warmer air can hold more moisture. That concept is easier for most people to grasp in the case of a hurricane, Reed said.  For instance, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped more than 60 inches of rain in parts of Texas and slammed the coast with an 8-foot storm surge. Scientists have said climate change made Harvey’s rainfall more extreme. But that same process plays out over land as water evaporates from the soil, grass, crops and forests. And more moisture can be drawn out of soil and vegetation the warmer it gets.  “Part of that is the general circulation of the atmosphere-ocean system which moves air around the world and brings moisture into areas over land,” Reed said. “Another aspect is that, over the last 100 plus years, the land surface has actually warmed more than the ocean, so the largest signal that we’re actually seeing in surface temperature is occurring overland, and inland as well.”  What it adds up to is a higher risk of dangerous flooding. “While extreme events and floods have sort of always been a part of a climate cycle, they can get more frequent and they can be a lot more intense as the planet is warmed,” Beth Tellman, co-founder of flood database Cloud to Street and assistant professor of geography at the University of Arizona, told CNN. “The intensity of rainfall from the storm systems in both St. Louis and eastern Kentucky are the reality and the physical manifestation of (climate change) happening now in our lives.”  Andrew Smith, a co-founder and director at the flood modeling group Fathom, analyzed the St. Louis flooding event and noted that while there is a strong connection between the climate crisis and extreme rainfall, researchers have also pointed to population growth as one of the factors that will increase the risk and impact of flooding.  “In many ways, it’s these isolated flash flood events in urban centers that will see a lot of amplification in hazard and risk in the future,” Smith said. “We have more faith in finding (a climate change connection) to these kinds of localized extreme rainfall events.” “They do seem to be happening more frequently,” he added.  The flooding, wildfire, heat waves and drought paint a picture of a nation in peril. And as one part of the country recovers from extreme rainfall, another can be scorched by deadly fires.  The McKinney fire in Northern California, which exploded in size over the weekend to become the state’s largest so far this year, burned uncontrolled Monday amid the West’s historic drought.   The fire generated its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are triggered by intense heat that forces air to rise rapidly and are a sign of how large and hot the fire was burning.  At the same time, forecasters at the National Weather Service warned that “dry lightning” was possible Monday – a phenomenon that is made more likely by exceptional drought. The dry air evaporates the storm’s rain before it ever hits the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. The climate crisis is ultimately intensifying the water cycle, not only making dry periods drier and wet periods wetter. All this, Tellman said, is another reason why policymakers need to put more focus on adaptation – helping communities adapt to the climate crisis and grow more resilient against extreme weather. “Passing a climate bill and moving forward politically in the US is really important and linked to preventing and trying to reduce the amount of rain that’s falling from the sky that’s causing events like we’re seeing in Kentucky and Yellowstone and St. Louis,” Tellman said.  “This is a real impact on our lives, so we need more mitigation, good climate legislation, and we also have to invest in adaptation to reduce impact for the future,” she added. “It’s going to get a lot worse if we don’t limit warming.”",Cawx Cafirepic;Kevin Reed;Andrew Smith;Beth Tellman;Robert Shackelford,Stony Brook University;Remarkable;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;University Of Arizona,"TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,4701;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,4041;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,2639;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,20;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,5040;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,20;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,5040;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,20;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5040;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,20;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,5040;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,20;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,5040;WATER_SECURITY,367;WATER_SECURITY,3704;WATER_SECURITY,4030;WATER_SECURITY,4524;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,367;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,3704;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4030;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4524;KILL,323;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,323;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,323;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,129;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,620;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,727;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,825;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1364;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1750;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2474;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2845;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3184;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3526;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4740;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4987;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5061;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5384;LEGISLATION,5396;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5396;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,5396;SCIENCE,630;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,630;POPULATION_DENSITY,3263;WB_640_POPULATION_AND_DEMOGRAPHIC_CHANGE,3263;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3263;WB_1448_DEMOGRAPHIC_CHANGE,3263;DISASTER_FIRE,4168;DISASTER_FIRE,4339;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,235;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2429;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2396;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2915;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2975;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3110;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3332;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3670;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2396;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2915;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2975;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3110;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3332;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3670;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,4130;WB_1777_FORESTS,4130;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4130;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1576;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1616;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2611;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2611;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,2611;WB_2945_DATABASE,2611;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAVY_RAIN,1394;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2649;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3041;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,406;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,3681;NATURAL_DISASTER_STORM_SURGE,1720;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1477;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2054;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4282;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4537;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,136;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,734;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,832;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,1757;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,2852;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,3533;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,136;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,734;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,832;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1757;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2852;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3533;URBAN,3396;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,3694;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOOD,3380;EDUCATION,656;EDUCATION,2680;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,656;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2680;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1292;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,1029;WB_2120_SATELLITES,1029;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,1029;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1029;WB_137_WATER,1840;WB_137_WATER,4784;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,2602;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3054;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3380;USPEC_POLICY1,4909;EPU_POLICY_POLICYMAKERS,4909;",California;Texas;Klamath;Kentucky

608,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/us/nikolas-cruz-social-media-online-searches/,"For months leading up to the Parkland massacre, Nikolas Cruz searched the internet for information and videos about mass shootings, leaving behind YouTube comments expressing his desire to “kill people,” according to testimony in the penalty phase of his trial.  Broward County Sheriff’s Office Detective Nick Masters, an electronic data analyst, took the stand Wednesday, where he read aloud dozens of Cruz’s Google searches, some of which included broad, generic search terms like “murder” or “shooting people.”  But Cruz also sought information about specific mass shootings, including those at Virginia Tech, in Las Vegas and at Columbine High School, and the people who carried them out, according to Masters’ testimony and a list of posts and searches released by the court. Cruz searched for how many rounds were fired in different mass shootings, as well as information about the weapon used in Las Vegas, Masters testified.  Some of the evidence revealed in court Wednesday was previously known. But the testimony gave jurors tasked with deciding if Cruz is sentenced to death a look at the full breadth of his online posts and searches, underscoring prosecutors’ arguments the defendant’s decision to carry out the shooting – in which 17 people were killed and 17 others injured – was not based on a whim, but calculated and premeditated.  Indeed, other searches appeared to show Cruz’s attention narrowing on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, from which he’d been expelled. Almost two weeks before the shooting, the then-19-year-old searched for a map of his former school, the list released by the court shows. The day before the shooting, Cruz searched for “how long does it take for a cop to show up at a school shooting,” and on the morning of the day of the shooting, he searched simply, “marjory stoneman douglas.”  Cruz, now 23, pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder, and the ongoing phase of his criminal trial is to determine his sentence: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while Cruz’s defense attorneys are asking the jury for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. If they recommend Cruz be sentenced to death, the jurors must be unanimous. To make their decision, jurors will hear aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances – reasons why or why not Cruz should be executed. In his opening statement, prosecutor Michael Satz said there were seven aggravating factors, including that the attack disrupted a government function (i.e. school) and that the killings were “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel.” “These aggravating factors far outweigh any mitigating circumstances,” Satz said at the time, “anything about the defendant’s background, anything about his childhood, anything about his schooling, anything about his mental health, anything about his therapy, anything about his care.” The defense delayed its opening statements until later in the trial. On Wednesday, Masters also read comments Cruz posted under different usernames – including his own name – on YouTube, including, “Im going to be a professional school shooter” just five months before he carried out the shooting. In other comments, Cruz wrote that he hated people and repeatedly reiterated his desire to kill people, per Masters’ testimony, and at one point promised to “go on a killing rampage.” In another comment, Cruz referred to himself as a “psychopath.” One comment posted on the evening of October 31, 2017 – in which Cruz said, in part, “itsss ovvverrrrr” and “my … time is almost hearrrrrrr” – was made hours before his mother’s death, while she was in the hospital, a defense attorney pointed out.  All of the YouTube comments were “publicly available,” Masters testified in response to that attorney’s questions, adding that, as far as he was aware, Google and YouTube did not have a strategy for monitoring searches or comments for threats.  The trial, which is expected to last months, has already seen testimony from witnesses outlining Cruz’s actions before, during and after the shooting, including from the brother of one of the wounded victims, who testified Cruz sat next to him in a McDonald’s after the shooting and asked him for a ride home.  The shooting devastated the South Florida community and thrust victims’ families and teenage survivors into the national spotlight as they urged elected officials to pass legislation that would stem the tide of mass shootings.

652,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/europe/griner-russia-prisoner-swap-lavrov-intl-hnk/,"The US and Russia have indicated they are ready to hold talks over a prisoner swap, a day after basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of drug smuggling and sentenced to nine years in prison for carrying less than a gram of cannabis oil through a Moscow airport. Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Cambodia that the Kremlin is “ready to discuss this topic, but within the framework of the channel that has been agreed by the presidents,” state news agency RIA Novosti reported. “There is a specified channel that has been agreed upon by [Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden], and no matter what anyone says publicly, this channel will remain in effect,” Lavrov reportedly said Friday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. Shortly later, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the same summit that the US will “pursue” talks with Russia. “We put forward, as you know, a substantial proposal that Russia should engage with us on. And what Foreign Minister Lavrov said this morning and said publicly is that they are prepared to engage through channels we’ve established to do just that. And we’ll be pursuing that,” Blinken told reporters at a press briefing. President Joe Biden said later on Friday that he’s hopeful about efforts to secure Griner. “I’m hopeful. We’re working hard,” Biden told reporters outside the White House after a bill signing. The comments from each side suggest that a negotiation process, which has already proven complex, could accelerate in the coming days. Russian government officials requested last month that a former colonel from the country’s domestic spy agency, who was convicted of murder in Germany last year, be included in the US’ proposed swap of notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout for Griner and Paul Whelan, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Whelan, a US citizen, has been held by Russia since 2018 and was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 on espionage charges that he has strenuously denied. Griner’s conviction has raised similar concerns that she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine. The US State Department classifies the pair as wrongfully detained. Griner, a Women’s National Basketball Association star, pleaded guilty to carrying cannabis oil in her luggage as she traveled through a Moscow airport on February 17. She testified in court that she was aware of Russia’s strict drug laws and had no intention of bringing cannabis into the country, saying she was in a rush and “stress packing.” Prior to the verdict on Thursday, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech. “I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” she said.  “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom,” she continued. Griner’s lawyers had hoped that her guilty plea and statements of remorse would result in a more lenient sentence. Her conviction, Blinken told reporters, “puts a spotlight on [Washington’s] very significant concern with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda using individuals as political pawn.” “The same goes for Paul Whelan,” Blinken added. Earlier Friday, a US State Department official told reporters there had been no “serious response” from Russia on a proposed swap. The same official said Blinken and Lavrov had not met while at the Cambodia summit, and that Blinken had no plans to do so. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Russia would not discuss the prospect of a transfer publicly. “If we discuss through the press some exchange-related nuances, then these exchanges will never take place. The Americans have already made this mistake,” he said Friday. Peskov, asked whether Putin could pardon Griner, said that “there is a certain [legal] procedure that the convicted can resort to, in accordance with the law.” According to the Russian law, to start the clemency procedure, a convict needs to write a petition to the Russian president.   Before the start of Thursday’s WNBA game between Griner’s Phoenix Mercury and the Connecticut Sun, members of both teams linked arms around center court, and a 42-second moment of silence was held for Brittney Griner. Near the end of those 42 seconds, members of the crowd started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” This story has been updated with additional developments.

624,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/planned-parenthood-arson/,"Federal prosecutors have charged a 25-year-old man who allegedly set fire to a Planned Parenthood building in Michigan. Joshua Brereton of Paw Paw, Michigan, was charged with one count of arson of an organization receiving federal funding. If convicted, Brereton faces up to 20 years in prison, according to the Justice Department. The charge also carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence. According to court documents, law enforcement responded to a reported fire at a Kalamazoo Planned Parenthood in late July. After the fire was extinguished, the local fire marshal noticed that fires were ignited from two separate sources – in the bushes outside the building, and from a “fire starter log that looked like it had been thrown onto the roof.” Through the Planned Parenthood surveillance footage, investigators determined that the person who started the fire used a Duraflame log to start the fire on the roof, court documents say. They then searched store records and learned that Brereton had bought a Duraflame log at a local Walmart less than two hours before the fire. Brereton’s appearance in the store’s security camera footage matched that of the Planned Parenthood, court documents say. Investigators say they also located Brereton’s YouTube channel, where he posted videos railing against the government, taxes and abortion. “Like right now, we have a genocide happening,” Brereton says in one video, according to court documents. “Genocide! Of babies! And people think this is always a hot topic. You literally have neighbors who think it’s OK to kill a baby.” He went on to encourage watchers to “change society from the inside out” and told them that “nobody else is going to do it.” Brereton has not yet entered a formal plea, according to the court docket.

495,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/biden-russia-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-cnntv/,"A bipartisan pair of senators has called on the Biden administration to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in response to its invasion of Ukraine, saying they would push Congress to pass a bill issuing the designation “whether or not” it had President Joe Biden’s support. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that the designation should be made either by the President or Congress, with both of them saying Biden must intensify pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and continue aiding Ukraine amid the ongoing invasion. “I hope the President will decide to adopt this stance voluntarily and he hasn’t taken it off the table on the state-sponsored terrorism,” said Blumenthal, who represents Connecticut.  Graham, of South Carolina, said he wants the Biden administration to engage with Congress in designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism but said Congress is “willing” to advance legislation calling for the designation regardless.    “I’d like to work with (the Biden administration). But whether or not we have to do legislation to make it happen – we’re willing to do. I am urging the administration to act now,” Graham said. The two senators traveled together in June to Ukraine, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and called on Biden to send more humanitarian aid to the county and issue stronger sanctions in addition to designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. The US State Department is responsible for designating nations as state sponsors of terrorism. The department defines the designation as a country that has “repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.” There are only four countries that are currently labeled state sponsors of terrorism by the US: North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Syria. In July, the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the State Department to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. And in April, a senior administration official said department officials were looking at the possibility of labeling Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.  Both senators on Sunday praised House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for making a controversial visit to Taiwan last week and connected American support for the self-governing island to the impact of US aid to Ukraine in combating Russia’s invasion. Blumenthal said, “China is watching what we do in Ukraine” as it considers potential actions in neighboring Taiwan. “She should have gone, I’m glad she went,” Graham said. “If she hadn’t gone, what would that have sent a signal to the Iranians and to the Russians?” Upcoming Senate agenda Though Graham and Blumenthal were split on the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats’ sweeping climate and health care bill that is being debated in the Senate on Sunday, the senators both advocated more bipartisan gun legislation. The two senators, who both supported the gun safety legislation passed earlier this year, said there were more gun safety overhauls they both want to see passed. They specifically highlighted a proposal to empower judges and law enforcement to restrict gun access to those who may pose a threat to others.  “I think what we can do is incentivize states to give them the tools they need to deal with this before it’s too late,” Graham said, stressing that his proposal would not be a “national ‘red flag’ law.” “The common ground that I think we share and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share: Keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, but through due process,” Blumenthal said. The two stood by their respective party’s positions when asked about Democrats’ climate and health care bill. Blumenthal said the bill would deliver “historic” cost savings to Americans, while Graham said the legislation is “gonna make everything worse.” Blumenthal and Graham also split on whether Congress should codify the right to marriage for same-sex couples. Though some Republicans have said they would side with Democrats on the bill, Graham said he believes same-sex marriage laws should be decided by the states. When asked if the US Supreme Court decision affirming the right to same-sex marriage should be overturned, Graham replied: “Well, that’d be up to the court.”  2024 election Blumenthal, who is up for reelection this year, did not say whether or not he wants Biden to run for reelection in 2024, saying instead that he is concentrating on this year’s midterms. “I’m going to be very blunt and very honest with you. My focus is totally on this November,” Blumenthal said. He continued: “I will support President Biden if he decides he wants to run and I think his decision will be determined by how November ends for the Democratic Party and for senators like myself who are running for reelection.” Graham, in contrast, reiterated his support for Donald Trump and said he would support the former President if he runs for a second term in 2024. However, Graham said Trump should refrain from bringing up election conspiracies if he runs again, noting: “I don’t believe the election was stolen.” But he added that he wants to “look at election integrity measures.” “I think we should look at election integrity measures to make sure some problems don’t happen again. But if he runs for president, talking about 2020 is not what people want to hear,” Graham said. Graham has been subpoenaed by an Atlanta-area grand jury investigating efforts made by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.

268,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard-north-carolina/,"The Supreme Court said Wednesday that it would hear two major cases concerning race-based affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina on October 31, setting the stage for a landmark opinion that could gut precedent that allows colleges to consider a student’s race when deciding which students should be admitted. Supporters of affirmative action fear the court, bolstered by three of former President Donald Trump’s appointees, could eliminate admission practices that have widely benefited Black and Hispanic students. The court has already ensured that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s first African American female justice, can participate on the issue. Originally, the two cases concerning policies out of Harvard and the University of North Carolina were consolidated so that they would be argued together. But after Jackson said during her confirmation hearing that she would recuse herself from the Harvard dispute because she served on Harvard’s board of overseers, the court decoupled the cases. Now, all nine justices will hear the North Carolina dispute at 10 a.m. ET on October 31, and then around an hour later eight will sit for the Harvard case. Lower US courts have ruled in favor of Harvard and the University of North Carolina, holding that the programs used race in a sufficiently limited way to fulfill compelling interests in diversity. The challenges are being spearheaded by conservative activist Edwin Blum. The Harvard challenge is brought under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits schools receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race. The UNC lawsuit similarly claims Title VI grounds, as well as a violation of the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the law, which covers state institutions. In the last several weeks, so-called “friend of the court” briefs have flooded the court’s docket from civil rights groups, states, educational institutions and business leaders. The Department of Justice urged the justices to rule in favor of the school policies and uphold precedent. “This court has repeatedly held that although all racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, consideration of race is permissible if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in court papers.

577,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/business-food/ihop-applebees-earnings/,"Cash-strapped consumers are starting to trade down, swapping higher-priced goods for more affordable alternatives. That’s good news for Applebee’s and IHOP.  In the three months ending June 30, sales at the two chains, which are both owned by Dine\n            \n                (DIN) Brands, grew about 6% to 8% among households earning over $75,000 per year, according to Dine\n            \n                (DIN) CEO John Peyton.  The bump “suggests to us that guests that often dine at more expensive restaurants are finding Applebee’s and IHOP because of their well-known value position,” Peyton said during a Tuesday analyst call discussing the company’s quarterly results. The phenomenon is “why we perform well during tough times like this,” he said, adding that the brands had relatively good results during the 2008 financial crisis.  But there’s a flip side to gaining sales among higher-income customers.  Both brands saw their sales drop a few percentage points among households earning under $50,000 a year. “We assume that they’ve left us for lower-cost options,” Peyton said. Those losses didn’t drag down the company’s quarterly results, however. Sales at Applebee’s locations open at least a year rose 1.8% in the quarter, and IHOP restaurants open at least a year saw sales pop 3.6% in that period.  Applebee’s and IHOP have both raised their menu prices this year. Instead of focusing on absolute prices, they’re leaning into other conceptions of value. At all times, “both of our brands … position themselves as value-oriented,” Peyton said. That means “delicious food [and] generous portions in a wonderful environment at an affordable and approachable price,” he added, noting “at times like these, when economics are tough for our guests, our brands have particular expertise” in adding more value.  Applebee’s tries to avoid straight discounts. Instead, it offers deals on meal add-ons, like adding a dozen shrimp for a dollar when you order a steak. Another tactic is giving out freebies. As part of a Top Gun promotion earlier this year, Applebee’s customers who spent at least $25 at the restaurant got free movie tickets.   At IHOP, customers can find discounted items at the brand’s IHOPPY Hour, which starts at 3pm at participating restaurants, when entrees, snacks and sides are sold at lower prices than usual. There are also limited-time promotions that, for example, allow kids to eat free.

46,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/senate-vote-nato-finland-sweden/,"The Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a resolution to ratify membership for Sweden and Finland in NATO, a historic vote aimed at strengthening the defense bloc amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. NATO formalized its invitation to Sweden and Finland to join the alliance at the end of June and the decision must go to the 30 member states’ parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. President Joe Biden sent the protocols for ratification to the Senate in July, paving the way for the vote, which needed to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate to succeed. The final tally of the Senate vote was 95 to 1, with GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voting in opposition and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voting present.   Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Tuesday that the vote to approve the resolution of ratification for Sweden and Finland’s application to NATO would take place and said that he had invited the ambassadors from Finland and Sweden to join in the gallery during debate and votes.  “Our NATO alliance is the bedrock that has guaranteed democracy in the western world since the end of World War II. This strengthens NATO even further and is particularly needed in light of recent Russian aggression,” Schumer said in remarks from the Senate floor.  “When Leader McConnell and I met with the Finnish President and Swedish Prime Minister in May, we committed to do this as fast as we could and certainly before we go home for the August recess,” Schumer said.  Once the Senate approves Sweden and Finland’s NATO accession protocols, “the next step in the ratification process is for the President to sign an instrument of ratification of the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN. “Once the President has signed an instrument of ratification, that instrument is deposited (in the case of a multilateral treaty) with the treaty’s depositary,” which in the case of NATO, is the Department, the spokesperson said. These steps will not happen on the same day that the Senate approves, and the final arrangements for depositing the instrument of ratification have not yet been made, the spokesperson told CNN. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted in remarks on the floor on Wednesday ahead of the vote that it would be, “as decisive as it is bipartisan.” McConnell argued that admitting Sweden and Finland to NATO will “only strengthen the most successful military alliance in human history.” McConnell also used his floor time to take aim at lawmakers who do not support the resolution.  “If any senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish them good luck,” he said. “This is a slam dunk for national security that deserves unanimous bipartisan support.” Sweden and Finland both announced their intention to join NATO in May, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a sudden shift in attitudes toward joining the bloc. The reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one member an attack against all. Article 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since it was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. Hawley explained his position on the issue in a recent op-ed in The National Interest titled “Why I won’t Vote to Add Sweden and Finland to NATO.”  “Finland and Sweden want to join the Atlantic Alliance to head off further Russian aggression in Europe,” he wrote. “That is entirely understandable given their location and security needs. But America’s greatest foreign adversary doesn’t loom over Europe. It looms in Asia. I am talking of course about the People’s Republic of China. And when it comes to Chinese imperialism, the American people should know the truth: the United States is not ready to resist it. Expanding American security commitments in Europe now would only make that problem worse—and America, less safe.” Paul similarly outlined his position in an op-ed in the American Conservative.  “As for Sweden and Finland, we still need serious, rational, objective debate on the costs and benefits of admitting two historically neutral nations who have such strategic geographic position in relation to Russia,” he wrote. “Before the Russian invasion, I would have said no. But given Russian actions, I have shifted from being against their admittance to NATO to neutral on the question, and will as a consequence vote ‘present.’” CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.

261,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/sport/deshaun-watson-tony-buzbee-suspension-spt-intl/,"The NFL said Wednesday it is appealing a decision by a former federal judge to sit Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson without pay for just six games. The league is pushing for a full-season suspension instead. On Monday, Watson was suspended for six games this season for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy in private meetings with massage therapists while he was with the Houston Texans.   The NFL had asked Sue L. Robinson, the former judge hired by the NFL and its players union to decide on Watson’s punishment, for a suspension covering the 17-game regular season and the playoffs.   No player accused of non-violent sexual misconduct, as Watson has been, has received a suspension longer than six games, Robinson said in her 16-page ruling issued Monday.  “While it may be entirely appropriate to more severely discipline players for nonviolent sexual conduct, I do not believe it is appropriate to do so without notice of the extraordinary change this position portends for the NFL and its players,” she wrote. “The NFL notified the NFLPA that it will appeal Judge Robinson’s disciplinary decision and filed its brief this afternoon,” league officials said Wednesday. “Commissioner Roger Goodell will determine who will hear the appeal.” On Thursday, the league announced Goodell had selected former New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey to hear the appeal, noting Harvey has arbitrated other cases and has advised the league on the “development and implementation of workplace policies, including the NFL’s Personal Conduct Policy.” Harvey is also a consulting expert with the NFL’s Diversity Advisory Committee, which helps improve racial and gender diversity throughout the league. Watson has repeatedly denied the accusations.  “I’ve never assaulted, I never disrespected, and I never harassed any woman in my life,” Watson has said. “I don’t have any regrets.” The NFL Player’s Association has already said it would not appeal. The union declined to comment Wednesday.  The Browns also declined to comment. The attorney of Watson’s accusers said the NFL “does not care about the rights of women” following the Cleveland Browns quarterback’s suspension for sexual misconduct allegations. Appearing Tuesday on ESPN’s “First Take,” attorney Tony Buzbee attacked the investigation, saying he hopes the NFL will appeal the case, but his clients are angered and disappointed by the lenient suspension handed down by a disciplinary officer.  “Don’t expect the NFL to do anything heroic here,” Buzbee said.   Two grand juries in Texas declined to charge Watson with any crimes.  Twenty-four civil lawsuits have been filed against Watson – 23 have been settled confidentially.  Watson’s attorney Rusty Hardin told CNN he will not comment until after the NFL decides whether to appeal. Judge Robinson said she was suspending the 26-year-old for his “predatory conduct.” “Although this is the most significant punishment ever imposed on an NFL player for allegations of non-violent sexual conduct, Mr. Watson’s pattern of conduct is more egregious than any before reviewed by the NFL,” Robinson wrote in the 16-page ruling.  But, despite those findings, Judge Robinson critiqued the NFL for asking for an unprecedented full-season suspension which would be far lengthier than other players accused of non-violent sexual conduct.  On Tuesday, Buzbee – the attorney for the plaintiffs in the case against Watson – told ESPN he hopes the NFL moves forward with an appeal because that gesture would be well received by the accusers.  “I think that would change the messaging and I think it would be well received by the women I represent,” he said.  In her findings, Robinson wrote that her decision is limited by the record that was presented to her by NFL investigators who are former prosecutors with decades of experience investigating sexual assault cases. She noted that Watson had “allegedly worked with more than 60 massage therapists” during the period under consideration, and that the NFL had “only investigated the claims of the 24 therapists suing Mr. Watson for damages.”  And of the 24, Robinson wrote that the NFL was only able to interview 12 alleged victims. They relied on the testimony of four of those 12 in the case presented to her for review.     Buzbee attacked the way in which the investigation was conducted.  “None of my clients testified in front of the federal judge. I think that’s a common misconception that four people testified. That’s not the case. Not one of them showed up. Not one of them was asked to show up and testify,” he said. “Since those interviews, we have had no contact whatsoever with the NFL.  “They care about the bottom line. They care about making money,” said Buzbee on ESPN. “They’re trying to manage this as a PR crisis, but as far as trying to do anything to assuage these particular women or women’s rights – or dealing with women’s rights in general – that’s not part of their mission statement and they’ve made that very clear throughout this process.”  On Tuesday, the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center said it was “disappointed” by the ruling to suspend Watson for only six games.  “The 6-game suspension given dangerously mirrors the flaws in our criminal justice systems and sends a grave message to our communities,” the organization said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. “Far too often those in positions of power and celebrity who commit violence against others are not held accountable for their actions. “These ongoing headlines are triggering for so many. To survivors, we say we see you and we believe you. Your story matters. Cleveland Rape Crisis Center is available 24/7/365 online or by calling/texting (216) 619-6192.”  The ruling comes after a number of women who worked as massage therapists filed lawsuits against Watson alleging sexual assault or misconduct during massage sessions. Last month, 30 women who have made or intended to make claims against the Texans organization over Watson’s alleged misconduct settled their claims, according to a statement from Buzbee and the Texans’ ownership.  Watson, a three-time Pro Bowler, did not play last season while a member of the Houston Texans because of a trade demand as well as the investigations into these allegations.  Days later, the Browns traded three first-round picks for Watson and then signed him to a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history.  Watson will not be paid during his suspension, but the Browns structured his new contract so his base salary is $690,000 his first year and then $46 million for each of the next four years, according to the salary tracking website Spotrac.

195,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/weather/drought-map-northeast-texas-climate/,"More than 50% of the country was in some level of drought for the fourth week in a row, the US Drought Monitor reported Thursday, as the combination of extreme heat and low rainfall is drawing the moisture out of plants and soil. And no region of the country has been spared.  The West and California remains engulfed in a multi-year megadrought. But even in the Northeast, a severe “flash drought” – one that comes on rapidly – has intensified and expanded from Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts into New Hampshire and Maine.  Yet even as drought is increasingly worrying in the Northeast, Midwest and South, waves of extreme rainfall are menacing parts of Missouri and Kentucky.  A flash flood warning was issued for the western suburbs of St. Louis early Thursday morning as rainfall rates climbed to several inches per hour, prompting fears of a repeat of last week’s flooding emergency. Scientists have warned that extremes on both ends of the spectrum will become more frequent and more intense as the planet warms. Drought expands in Northeast Drier conditions in the Northeast led to moderate and severe drought expansion in the New York City area and parts of New England, the Drought Monitor reported.   “Short-term moderate and severe drought continued to expand, especially in the New York City area, New Jersey, and New England, where rainfall was sparse and temperatures were a few degrees above normal,” the Drought Monitor said.  The worsening dry conditions have already strained water resources in the region, and officials have been warning residents to be mindful about their water usage. In mid-July, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont asked residents to dial down their water usage, in hopes of preventing “harm should the drought become prolonged.” Forecasters expect this trend to continue as “temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above normal across the Northeast and New England on Thursday afternoon, where it will feel like the upper 90s and 100s,” said CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett.  The Drought Monitor noted that water restrictions and farming impacts were becoming more common in the region as the dry conditions persisted for another week.  Texas and the West Drought also expanded in some areas of the Southern Plains, where temperatures are running warmer than normal – particularly in Texas, where the consequences have clawed into agriculture and cattle ranching.  “Drought impacts across Texas ranged from crop failure to water supply problems, in one case from a well failure,” the Drought Monitor reported. Cattle ranchers in the state told CNN the conditions have been so dire and the economic strain so large that they can no longer maintain healthy livestock, which has forced them to sell off their cows for slaughter way ahead of schedule. Income is the bottom line on these decisions, the ranchers said, as the cost of vehicles, equipment and diesel skyrockets. There was one place that saw improvement in the drought over the past week: heavy rainfall fell in parts of the Texas Panhandle east into Oklahoma, Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and portions of Tennessee, leading to an improvement in conditions across that region.

691,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/abortion-south-georgia-louisiana/,"Just how far people in the South will have to travel to access abortion care will be defined by legal challenges unfolding in Louisiana and Georgia. Almost every state in the Southeast bans the procedure or limits it to all but the earliest stages of pregnancy – with laws that were allowed to go into effect with the Supreme Court’s reversal this summer of Roe v. Wade. But abortion rights advocates are fighting in state court for orders blocking those restrictions. Both Louisiana’s so-called trigger ban – which outlawed the procedure outright, with no exemptions for rape or incest – as well as a Georgia ban for abortions after about six weeks into the pregnancy are currently in force. Providers have asked the Louisiana Supreme Court to reinstate a judge’s order blocking that ban, after an appeals court suspended it and revived the prohibition. A judge in Atlanta, meanwhile, will consider on Monday whether to temporarily halt the enforcement of the six-week ban while the next steps in the legal challenge proceed.  “Georgia –  Atlanta, Georgia, specifically – was a hub for abortion access for people across the southeast,” said Jalessah Jackson, the interim executive director of Access Reproductive Care-Southeast, an abortion fund that provides financial support for abortion-seekers in several southern states.  “Georgia was really that space where people could come and have options for where they want to have their abortion,” Jackson told CNN. “And so, with the sort of limited scope that we have right now because of the six-week ban, that has really impacted people’s ability to access care in the entire region.”  The Supreme Court’s ruling cleared the way for states across the South and Midwest to try to enforce six-week bans or outright prohibitions on abortion that were on their books. Dozens of abortion clinics have closed since, with one analysis from July showing that, in the month since the ruling, the number of clinics offering abortion had shrunk from 71 to 28 in the 11 states seeking to implement those extreme restrictions.  The seven states where no clinics remain open – Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas –  accounted for 80,500 abortions in 2020, according to the analysis, which was done by the reproductive rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. In this landscape, abortion seekers will have to travel hundred of miles to obtain the procedure. For many women in the South, particularly if bans in Georgia and Louisiana are enforced, the closest clinic may be in Kansas, Illinois, North Carolina, or elsewhere – potentially across several states’ borders. Supporters of the restrictions say that courts should follow the US Supreme Court’s lead and let legislatures decide what abortion policy looks like at the state level. “The careful, thoughtful studied approach as the Georgia legislature took before and during the 2019 session is the way it needs to be addressed,” said Republican state Rep. Ed Setzler, a sponsor of the 2019 Georgia law, which prohibits abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. “We recognize life begins at conception but we balanced that with these difficult circumstances and to land where there’s a protection of a child that has a beating heart, that seems to be reasonable sound middle ground,” he said. The “significant role” Georgia and Louisiana have played  Even before Roe fell – allowing abortion bans in Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and elsewhere in the South to take effect – abortion seekers were traveling to Louisiana and Georgia to obtain the procedure, in part because of the other ways states were able to complicate access, even with Roe on the books.  Georgia in particular had clinic infrastructure more expansive than what’s usual in the South; right now, 11 abortion providers are open in the state, according to the National Abortion Federation. Atlanta being an airline hub also makes Georgia clinics accessible for those with the resources to fly to obtain the procedure.  Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a senior research associate with the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights, said he expects to see “huge increases” in people traveling to seeking abortions in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision in the recent case, called Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.  “Many of the states to which patients have historically traveled to obtain abortions have now restricted or eliminated access entirely, which means people seeking care have to travel even farther to obtain it,” he said.  With a Democratic governor, North Carolina does not have extreme limits like a six week or outright ban” on the procedure at the moment, while in Florida, a 15-week ban is in force while a legal challenge to it continues.  After the Dobbs decision came down, Georgia’s six-week abortion ban remained on hold for several weeks due to a pre-Dobbs federal court order. Travel from out-of-state patients spiked, according to Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director at the Atlanta-based Feminist Women’s Health Center, who told CNN that just from one clinic in Alabama, nearly 100 abortion patients were referred to Georgia providers in the days immediately after the Dobbs decision.  Even after the six-week ban was allowed to take effect on July 20, traffic from out-of-state patients has continued, she said, in part because early-pregnancy abortions are allowed under it and in part because Georgia’s law has a rape exemption not present in Alabama’s outright ban, nor in the six-week bans in Kentucky and Tennessee.  “When the six-week ban was allowed to go into effect, it certainly has changed how significant a role we can play in the southeast supporting care for neighboring states, but it has not completely eliminated that need,” said Jackson of the Feminist Women’s Health Center. A Texas six-week ban that was allowed to go into effect last September was a preview of the role Louisiana will play for access if its ban is blocked by courts there. At the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, Texas patients made up nearly two-thirds of the clinic’s patients compared to just 18% of patients before the Texas law was in effect.  “Louisiana had been this kind of stalwart, it had been providing care to people in the entire region,” said Jenny Ma, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, who is involved in the challenge to the Louisiana trigger ban.  Louisiana and Georgia “were incredibly important, and continue to be really important,” she told CNN, “and that’s why these lawsuits are so pivotal as they continue to try to preserve access for as long as possible.”  Racial disparities for maternal health   The lawsuits challenging Louisiana and Georgia’s abortion laws cite those states’ constitutions for why those laws should be struck down.  In Georgia, the challengers are leaning on the state constitution’s privacy and liberty protections, which ACLU attorney Julie Kaye says have long been interpreted as more expansive than the US Constitution’s.  “For over a century the Georgia Supreme Court has strictly protected an individual’s right to be free from political interference into their private decisions about their body, health and life,” said Kaye, who is involved in the challenge of the Georgia law.   A spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is defending the law in court, declined CNN’s request for an interview. A spokesperson for Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry did not respond to CNN’s inquiries.  Louisiana Right to Life spokesperson Sarah Zagorski told CNN that the anti-abortion group “highly” doubts plaintiffs would be successful in their lawsuit. But if the trigger laws are blocked, Zagorski said it’s likely that Louisiana Right to Life would work with the state legislature again “to tighten our laws.”  The complaints filed against Louisiana and Georgia’s laws both highlight the maternal health risks of forced pregnant – risks that are exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities in the South and risks that are disproportionately faced by Black women.  “Louisiana ranks second to last, or 48th among states when it comes to the health of women and children,” says an affidavit filed by Dr. Janifer Tropez-Martin. She noted the state’s maternal mortality was increasing at a rate that exceeds the national average while pointing to a study showing that it had increased 28% since 2016. The affidavit adds that “Black individuals are 3.3 times more likely to experience maternal death than white individuals.”  According to the Georgia complaint, “the pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 2.3 times higher for Black Georgians than it was for non-Hispanic white Georgians.”  Asked about Louisiana’s high maternal mortality rate, Zagorski, of Louisiana Right to Life, said that it was “a tragedy that Louisiana has a high mortality rate among pregnant women, but legal abortion does not improve those rates.”  Across the South, most states have declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but several states, including Louisiana and Georgia, have temporarily allowed or are planning to allow low-income women to remain enrolled in Medicaid for up to 12 months after childbirth.  “Hopefully as time goes on, culture will change and the question will be how do we reach maternal patients better, how do we support them better, before and after they have their baby,” Zagorski said.

576,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/kiely-rodni-california-teen-search/,"Friends, family and authorities are scrambling to find 16-year-old Kiely Rodni after she disappeared following a campground party in Northern California.  Kiely was at the Prosser Family Campground on Friday night and was last seen around 12:30 a.m. Saturday, the Placer County Sheriff’s Office said.  “We are treating her disappearance as an abduction right now because we have not been able to locate her vehicle,” sheriff’s spokesperson Angela Musallam said.  Officials are looking for Kiely’s silver 2013 Honda CRV and say her phone has been out of service since the party. Kiely is White, 5’7” and about 118 pounds. She has blond hair, hazel eyes and a nose ring. Kiely was last seen wearing a black tank top and Dickies brand pants. There were 200-300 juveniles at the party, which was in a wooded area, Musallam said in a news conference Tuesday, and “someone knows something.” “We are pleading, we are urging anyone who was at that party to please come forward,” she said.  Kiely’s loved ones are wondering how no one saw the teen leave, CNN affiliate KCRA reported. “I can’t believe it. There has to have been one person – there were people sitting in cars, there were people everywhere around this place,” Kiely’s friend Sammi Smith told KCRA. The grounds are about 17 miles north of Lake Tahoe and 36 miles from Reno, Nevada.  About 150 law enforcement officers, including the FBI, search and rescue, canines and more than 100 volunteers are combing the area around where Rodni was last seen. “There is no evidence that supports an abduction, but we are not ruling anything out,” said Placer County Sheriff Troy Sander Tuesday. “We won’t rule anything out. This is a missing persons case, a search and rescue case.” On Monday, the Placer County Sheriff’s Office flew a search helicopter over the area.  “Despite the numerous resources we have utilized, Kiely and her vehicle are still missing,” the sheriff’s office said. “We are currently coordinating with the California Highway Patrol, Truckee Police, FBI, and the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office as we continue our search for Kiely.”  Kiely’s mother, Lindsey Rodni-Nieman, said the wait has been grueling.  “My head is all over the place and I’m terrified. Bad thoughts are very strong and hard to keep at bay,” Rodni-Nieman told KCRA. “But I’m trying to hold out hope, you know, that we’ll find her, that she’ll come home.” Friends and family have set up a website, FindKiely.com, to help with the search. And a GoFundMe account has been established to fund a reward for information leading to Kiely’s safe return. CNN’s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.

107,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/man-rescue-grandmother-kentucky-flooding-trnd/,"Amid disastrous flooding in eastern Kentucky, one anonymous man’s good deed helped rescue a grandmother and her family trapped inside a water-filled home.  Randy Polly was driving to get gas on Thursday morning when he encountered floodwaters that left him stranded on a patch of dry land in Whitesburg, Kentucky.  A few hours later, he watched from a distance as a man saved an elderly woman and others who were trapped in a house as the water kept rising.  Polly told CNN he could hear people yelling across the flooded road, “Get me help, get help.” Polly called 911, but emergency services were overwhelmed and unresponsive to his calls, he said. At around 9 a.m., he witnessed someone he described as a “hero” swim over to the house and start banging on a door and window.  A series of dramatic videos taken by Polly and shared with CNN show the rescue. Polly said it took about 30 minutes from start to finish, as the man entered the house through the window and helped each of the three family members leave safely.  Missy Crovetti, who is based in Green Oaks, Illinois, told CNN that the family rescued consisted of her grandmother Mae Amburgey, uncle Larry Amburgey and her brother Gregory Amburgey. They are safe and her grandmother and uncle are recovering in the hospital, she said. Crovetti said her uncle, who is in his 70s, had been put on a ventilator – likely due to water inhalation – and taken off later in the day. Her grandmother was being treated with antibiotics after suffering a laceration on her leg, Crovetti said, and as of Sunday had been diagnosed with pneumonia. “We’re hopeful but also terrified because of her age,” she said. Crovetti’s brother shared pictures that captured the flooding inside the house as the three waited to be rescued. In one of the pictures, you can see 98-year-old Mae sitting on her bed, which is nearly submerged in water.  Crovetti said she does not know the name of the man who rescued her family. Polly also said he does not know the man’s name.  Crovetti set up a verified GoFundMe campaign to help support her grandmother and other family members as they recover from the devastating floods.  The flooding had claimed the lives of at least 26 people as of Sunday morning. The National Weather Service put a flood watch in effect through at least Monday morning for parts of southern and eastern Kentucky. There is a Level 3 of 4 moderate risk for excessive rainfall on Sunday across southeastern Kentucky, according to the Weather Prediction Center.  The heavy rains and flooding began overnight on Wednesday, sweeping some homes from their foundations and forcing residents to search for higher ground. Gov. Andy Beshear has said that he expects the death toll to rise as search crews enter areas that are currently inaccessible.

680,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/doug-mastriano-january-6-committee/,"Doug Mastriano, the Trump-endorsed GOP nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, is expected to appear virtually on Tuesday before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection but might not end up answering any questions due to a dispute over his testimony, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The committee has been negotiating the terms of Mastriano’s deposition for weeks but the two sides still have not reached an agreement over whether his attorney would be allowed to videotape the deposition or be given access to the committee’s own full recording after the fact, the source said. As a result, Mastriano’s appearance Tuesday is expected to be brief and may end when the panel attempts to swear him in, the source added. Mastriano was a key figure in Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election. He went out of his way to advance then-President Donald Trump’s election lies – spearheading a faux legislative “hearing” at a hotel in Gettysburg a few weeks after the 2020 election, where Trump and his then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani made false claims about election fraud. Mastriano also chartered buses to bring Trump supporters to Washington on January 6. And he was briefly in charge of the Pennsylvania state Senate’s partisan “audit” of the 2020 election. His behind-the-scenes role helping Trump try to overturn the election came under scrutiny after the Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee released a report last year, revealing Mastriano’s correspondence with the Justice Department in late 2020, where he spread debunked claims of fraud. Last week, Mastriano threatened to walk out of a scheduled deposition before the House select committee unless the panel agreed to his conditions, potentially setting up a court fight over his testimony. In a letter to the committee, his attorney, Tim Parlatore, said he would pull out of a scheduled deposition unless they can agree to certain accommodations. Parlatore is asking that he be able to videotape the deposition, keep the footage in escrow, and release portions of it later on, if the committee publicly releases clips that he believes would require additional context.  CNN previously reported that Mastriano handed over some documents to January 6 committee in response to a subpoena he received in March. But there were clear limits to what Mastriano shared and the panel has sought an interview with him in the weeks since. Tuesday’s interview is scheduled to be virtual and begin at 10 a.m. ET, the source said. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment.

516,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/senate-bill-win-for-biden-analysis/,"If the US House soon passes the Senate’s landmark climate change and health care bill, it will help validate the Democrats’ monopoly on political power in Washington and hand Joe Biden a notable presidential legacy ahead of November’s midterm elections.  The measure finally squeezed through the Senate after an exhausting and dramatic round-the-clock marathon that stretched into Sunday afternoon – a major breakthrough following months of Democratic infighting that gouged deep divides in the party. The Inflation Reduction Act may not live up to its name and cut the cost of living. It dashed some big dreams of progressives who wanted it to do more. And its final passage may come too late to save Democrats in the midterms. But it’s still an enormous win for the party that seemed impossible just weeks ago.  In a goal Democrats have been chasing for decades, the legislation will for the first time give Medicare the power to negotiate the cost of a limited basket of prescription drugs, thereby bringing down costs. In extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, it could save health care coverage for countless people. And in spending nearly $370 billion to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change, it goes most of the way to reaching Biden’s ambitious plans to create a clean energy economy. The bill could also help revive US global leadership in the quest to save the planet by prodding other nations to follow suit. The victory is all the more remarkable since it was achieved against vehement GOP opposition in the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats had no room for error. Democrats spent months negotiating with themselves, as moderate senators like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema extracted concessions that progressives had little choice but to accept to save the bill. Coal state senator Manchin revived the measure after reversing his opposition late last month and agreeing to a clean energy push in return for concessions on fossil fuels.  At times, Biden was in the weeds trying to get this major chunk of his domestic agenda enacted. The credibility of his presidency depended on overcoming the obstacles to significant economy-changing legislation. But in recent weeks, saddled by plunging approval ratings, he let the Senate work its will and accepted a final result that fell far short of his original aspirations for a Franklin Roosevelt-style transformation. The Senate finally passed it, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie, shortly after Biden emerged from the White House from his second Covid isolation.  All major new laws are judged in multiple ways – on their impact on the lives of Americans, on how they shift the political environment and how they appear in retrospect, many years down the road, in history’s ledger. So even if Democrats’ achievement may not be rewarded at the ballot box anytime soon, it might not go without notice in the long term.  How voters and history will judge the big Democratic win If, as expected, this bill is passed along party lines in the House this week, its real world impact will be measured in whether it lives up to Democratic claims that it will slash carbon emissions at a time when the deadly effects of climate change – seen in extreme floods, droughts and wildfires – are becoming ever more obvious.  The party and the White House also say the bill could have a massive human impact by helping elderly Americans struggling to pay for certain vital medicines and create real quality of life improvements for millions.  And in extending Obamacare subsidies, this measure would lock in and prolong one of the greatest achievements of Democratic rule in the 21st century.   Then there are electoral reverberations from the passage of a bill that, like most legislation, will take months and years to be fully implemented and so could lack immediate, transformative political after-effects. It’s unclear whether this push, which will enshrine a major piece of Biden’s agenda, will rescue the President’s fast diminishing political fortunes. His approval rating, which has dipped below 40%, threatens to drag down Democrats and smash their hold on power in Washington in November. Democrats have faced a savage political storm for much of this year, as a nation exhausted by the pandemic has faced soaring gas and grocery prices.  This legislative achievement could at least gives them a chance to reengage with their voters, some of whom have given the President poor marks, according to recent polls. Democrats can argue they have made the most sweeping investments in combating climate change in history, an important consideration for generations – and especially young voters, who will live with a warming planet. “This is an absolute historic investment in climate change,” White House Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN’s Pamela Brown Sunday, touting the measure’s impact on fostering clean energy, growing jobs and saving consumers money. To get older voters to the polls, meanwhile, Democrats can stress drug price cuts now that Medicare will have some negotiating power.  Taken together with the Supreme Court’s overturning of the constitutional right to abortion and a recent easing of gasoline prices, Democrats have reason to hope their voters will turn out this fall. Driving base voters to the polls may not save the House, which many election analysts believe is heading to the GOP. But it could play into the critical handful of races that will decide the control of the Senate, where Republicans need to gain just one seat to win the majority.  More broadly, the poor political environment for Democrats has cleared somewhat, especially as Republicans nominate some candidates who could complicate the GOP’s ability to capitalize on what had been shaping up as a favorable year for them.  Even Biden’s fortunes appear to have turned in recent weeks after being beleaguered for much of the last year as crisis after crisis, at home and abroad, crashed into his White House and thwarted ambitious plans. A bumper jobs report on Friday helped tame fears the economy is about to head into recession. And the President presided over the killing of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan, going some way to repair his reputation as a shrewd commander-in-chief, which was tarnished by the chaotic end to the US war in the country.  Still, history suggests that the party of first-term presidents – especially those will an approval rating under 50% – tend to get a hammering in the midterm elections. And Republicans sense an opening. They are branding the Senate measure as yet another massive spending bill that will worsen already soaring inflation. Economists are divided on Democratic claims that the bill will reduce the cost of living. But if everyday costs continue to rise, it may not matter politically what the truth is – a damaging impression could take hold that Biden is once again pouring oil on the flames of inflation with a massive spending bill.   Senate Minority Mitch McConnell tried to immediately hammer home his party’s message in the midterms, accusing Democrats of introducing “giant job-killing tax hikes” and a “war on American fossil fuel” at a time of high energy prices. “(Democrats’) response to the runaway inflation they’ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,” said the Kentucky Republican. “The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.”  A powerful legacy even if it doesn’t translate in November Biden was quick to jump on Sunday’s Senate vote as a sign of momentum for his presidency. “Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” the President said, hinting at how Democrats, who have struggled to effectively market his wins as President, will sell the bill to voters. The passage of his health care and climate change bill in the Senate sets Biden up for a domestic legacy that stands comparison with any recent Democratic President. This adds to Biden’s previous successes in Congress, including a bipartisan infrastructure deal that evaded his two most recent predecessors, the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades and a pandemic rescue plan early in his presidency that the White House said lifted millions of kids out of poverty. These achievements may not move the political needle for Biden, especially if voters have already made up their mind on his presidency, with polls showing most Americans believe the nation is heading in the wrong direction. The President’s recent successes also appear unlikely to quell a drumbeat of debate about whether he should run for reelection in 2024, when he’ll be in his 80s. The age question is not going away for Biden.  But even if the President doesn’t get a substantial short-term boost for his winning streak and see his poll numbers significantly rise, the last few weeks have been vital in shifting narratives about his presidency. Most administrations are ultimately remembered for a handful of achievements that create a kind of narrative shorthand to encapsulate a President’s place in history. If the global climate push succeeds in mitigating the most disastrous impacts on the planet in decades to come, Biden – who did more than anyone else who held the presidency to respond to the threat – will come to be remembered for taking action. The same will be the case if a new era of electric vehicles is enshrined by the energy legislation and the US begins to turn its back on the internal combustion engine – a cornerstone of US freedoms of movement and prosperity for decades. Biden is also likely to get credit from future historians for his role in building on the Obama administration’s advances on expanding access to health care. The Inflation Reduction Act does fall far short of early hopes of transforming home health care, increasing education funding and offering dental and vision plans under Medicare. These are a few reasons why Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, was so critical of a bill he later voted for despite his reservations.  “This reconciliation bill goes nowhere near far enough in addressing the problems facing struggling working families. But it is a step forward and I was happy to support it,” Sanders said in a statement. But political success in the United States, on issues from civil rights to social care, has almost always come in increments, with one presidency building on the gains of another. Given the vicious and widening political divides of modern American, that has been more the case in recent years.  So Democrats, who may lose their majorities in November, may at least be able to console themselves by knowing that they did not squander their lease on power as had seemed likely for many months.",Ayman Al-Zawahiri;Gina Mccarthy;Joe Manchin;Bernie Sanders;Joe Biden;Joe Biden;Joe Biden;Kamala Harris;Kyrsten Sinema,Supreme Court;Senate Democrats;White House;White House;White House;White

321,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/economy/china-military-drills-taiwan-global-trade-intl-hnk/,"China’s live-fire military drills around Taiwan are threatening to disrupt trade and commercial travel in East Asia, forcing vessels to reroute away from one of the world’s busiest waterways and putting further pressure on strained global supply chains. On Thursday, China kicked off drills involving the navy, air force and other military forces in the seas and airspace surrounding Taiwan. The drills — unprecedented in number — are a direct show of force in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-governed island, which Beijing repeatedly warned against.   The Chinese Defense Ministry on Tuesday released a map of six zones around the island where it said it would conduct air and sea exercises as well as long-range live-fire exercises that will last until Sunday. Ships and aircraft have been warned to stay out of the areas during the drills. Taiwan has said the military exercises are tantamount to a “maritime and aerial blockade” and have “violated Taiwan’s territorial waters and its contiguous zone.”  They also threaten to disrupt trade flows in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The Taiwan Strait, a 110-mile-wide artery separating the island of Taiwan and continental Asia, is a key trade route for vessels carrying goods between major economies in northeast Asia such as China, Japan, and South Korea, and the rest of world.  The London-based shipping consultancy VesselsValue said there are currently 256 container ships and other vessels in Taiwanese territorial waters, with a further 60 estimated to arrive between Thursday and Sunday, when the drills will be performed.  “There is potential for substantial disruption to trade in the region,” said Peter Williams, a trade flow analyst at VesselsValue.  Shutting down trade routes around Taiwan, even temporarily, “raises concerns about whether China might successfully do this again, and what this could mean not just for future trade, travel and economic patterns, but potentially defensive and security scenarios as well,” said Nick Marro, lead analyst for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit.  Repercussions ahead It’s not yet clear what the long-term impact will be, but shippers expect delays due to rerouting, potential lost sales and higher costs for workers pulling longer hours.  Global supply chains have already been rattled by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which disrupted the flow of goods and drove up inflation in many parts of the world.  Any conflict in Taiwan, which dominates the semiconductor industry, could exacerbate the global shortage of computer chips, which are vital components for virtually all modern electronics. Taiwan has seven major ports. The Port of Kaohsiung, located on the southwestern coastline, is the largest harbor in Taiwan and the 15th largest in the world, according to the World Shipping Council. Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau issued three notices on Wednesday, asking vessels to use alternative routes for ports in the cities of Keelung, Taipei, Kaohsiung and others.  Taiwan reroutes international flights Taiwan also rerouted 18 international flight routes following negotiations with Japan and Philippines. Approximately 300 flights would be impacted as a result of the rerouting, Taiwan’s Transportation Minister Wang Kwo-tsai said Wednesday. “It is not over, the repercussions, for they are only just beginning,” said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, an Australian brokerage firm. “Far worse will be any economic retardation in the relationship between Taiwan and China as a result of the Pelosi visit,” he said.  China has already hit Taiwan with some trade curbs since Wednesday, including the suspension of some fruits and fish imports from Taiwan, and exports of natural sand to the island. The whole event may “continue to reverberate doing further damage for months, even years, to both the relationships of Taiwan and the USA with mainland China,” Bennett said.

572,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/gabby-petito-family-lawsuit-moab-utah-police/,"The family of Gabby Petito has submitted a $50 million claim against the Moab, Utah, Police Department, arguing the 22-year-old may not have been killed last year by her fiancé if officers had recognized he was the “true primary aggressor” in a domestic dispute about two weeks before her death. Petito’s parents are seeking $50 million in damages, claiming Moab officers were negligent in failing to investigate Brian Laundrie, 23, and his “self-evidently false claims” and the department was negligent in failing to train officers to investigate domestic violence incidents, according to their notice of claim sent to the department Monday, the first step in initiating a lawsuit against it.  Additionally, Petito’s family claims her killing was caused by the wrongful acts or neglect of the police department and its officers.  Moab officers “failed to recognize the serious danger (Petito) was in and failed to investigate fully and properly,” Brian Stewart, an attorney for the family said Monday in a news conference, referencing the moment Moab police stopped Petito and Laundrie after a witness said he saw them involved in a domestic incident.  “They did not have the training that they needed to recognize the clear signs that were evident that morning: that Gabby was a victim and that she was in serious need of immediate help,” Stewart said.  A Moab city spokesperson declined to comment, saying, “The City does not comment on pending litigation.”  Petito, an aspiring travel influencer, vanished last summer on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie. As a nationwide search ensued, attention also turned to Laundrie, who returned home to Florida and vanished in a nature reserve. Days into the search for Laundrie, Petito’s body was found in Grand Teton National Forest, and a coroner ruled she died by strangulation. Laundrie’s body was found  in mid-October in the nature reserve, along with a notebook in which he claimed responsibility for her death. A medical examiner determined he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The notice of claim against Moab police comes months after Petito’s mother and father, along with their respective spouses, sued Laundrie’s family, alleging his parents knew their son had killed Petito and were aware of “the whereabouts of her body.” Traffic stop occurred 2 weeks before murder  At the heart of Petito’s family’s claim is the traffic stop last August, which officers executed after being informed the witness “had seen Brian assault Gabby.”  Police pulled over their vehicle – a white Ford van – after it exceeded the speed limit, abruptly left its lane and struck a curb, according to a police report. Footage recorded by police body cameras shows Moab police officers talking to Petito and Laundrie, who admitted to having a fight in which Petito said she struck her fiancé first. Officers noticed Petito had cuts on her face and arm, and she “demonstrated how Brian had violently grabbed her face during their altercation,” telling police Laundrie “gets frustrated with me a lot.” But Petito also “displayed the classic hallmarks of an abused partner,” the notice says, taking blame for the incident. The officers “did not press further,” the notice says. According to the family’s claim, a photo taken at the time, which has not been made public, “shows a close-up view of Gabby’s face where blood is smeared on her cheek and left eye, revealing the violent nature of Brian’s attack.”  Laundrie told police the couple had been under increasing stress. He admitted to pushing Petito away when she tried to slap him and also to taking her phone, claiming he didn’t have one and was afraid that she would leave him. However, later in the interview, he took out his own phone and gave officers his number, the notice says. Despite the cuts and Laundrie’s inconsistencies, one of the officers said Petito must be booked into jail since, under the domestic violence statutes of Utah, she was considered the primary aggressor and Laundrie the victim. Both Petito and Laundrie objected, and the officers eventually agreed not to charge Petito as long as she and Laundrie agreed to spend the night apart. “Roughly two weeks later, Brian brutally murdered Gabby,” the notice says, “leaving her body in the woods of Grand Teton National Forest.” A review of the Moab Police Department’s handling of the incident by an independent investigator – a captain with the police department in Price, Utah, about 115 miles away – recommended the two officers who responded be placed on probation, saying they made “several unintentional mistakes” – namely failing to cite anyone for domestic violence, though there appeared to be only sufficient evidence to charge Petito. The investigative report, released in January, recommended new policies for the department, including additional domestic violence training and legal training for officers. The city at the time did not address any potential discipline for the two officers but said it “intends to implement the report’s recommendations” on new policies for the police department, including additional domestic violence training and legal training for officers. “Based on the report’s findings, the City of Moab believes our officers showed kindness, respect and empathy in their handling of this incident,” the city’s statement said. Petito’s parents and stepparents did not comment on the litigation during Monday’s virtual news conference at the direction of their lawyers. But her mother acknowledged the footage of the Moab incident was “very painful.”  “I wanted to jump through the screen, rescue her,” Nicole Schmidt said, encouraging victims of domestic violence to reach out for help.  Asked what the family wants the public to remember from Petito’s story, her father Joseph Petito, said people should learn there’s always a way out.  “Her legacy is to help people that don’t see a way out, and there are,” he said.",Brian Stewart;Gabby Petito;Brian Laundrie,Cnn;Police Department;Police Department,"TRIAL,675;GENDER_VIOLENCE,557;WB_742_YOUTH_AND_GENDER_BASED_VIOLENCE,557;WB_2441_DOMESTIC_VIOLENCE,557;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,557;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,557;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,197;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,368;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,524;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,819;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,836;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,197;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,368;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,524;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,819;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,836;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,293;KILL,156;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,156;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,515;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,515;SECURITY_SERVICES,95;SECURITY_SERVICES,793;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,95;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,793;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,95;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,793;TAX_FNCACT_AGGRESSOR,246;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,557;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,557;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,557;",Utah

331,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/politics/indiana-abortion-legislation-state-senate/,"Indiana’s Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill Saturday which would ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions, despite opposition from abortion rights and anti-abortion advocates. State lawmakers, reconvened in a special legislative session to consider abortion restrictions, passed Senate Bill 1 in a 26-20 vote following nearly four hours of passionate debate. It now moves to the Republican-controlled state House for consideration; if it becomes law, it would go into effect September 1. Ten Republicans crossed party lines Saturday voting against the bill, with some of them saying the near-total ban did not go far enough. The GOP-authored bill states those seeking an abortion following rape or incest would have to sign an affidavit attesting to the attack. Indiana presently allows abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization (or 22 weeks after the mother’s last menstrual period). It is one of two states, including West Virginia, reconvening special sessions to consider restrictions on abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in late June, finding there was no longer a federal constitutional right to the procedure.  Discussions on Saturday were fiery and emotional at times, replicating debates on the bill from earlier in the week. State senate President Suzanne Crouch, a Republican, threatened to clear the gallery more than once following outbursts of reaction from both inside the session and from protesters gathered outside. CNN affiliate WRTV filmed a large number of protesters gathered and chanting opposition to the bill in the hall. Some held signs reading “my body, my choice,” and “abortion bans replace freedom with force.” The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Susan Glick, had previously conceded she wasn’t happy with it, and called it a “vehicle bill” on Saturday. Glick said she expects the House will make changes, but added in its current form, the bill is an “expression of where we believe the state of Indiana is right now.” If the state House does make changes to the bill, it would come back to the Senate for another vote. Democratic state Sen. Jean Breaux called SB1 a “flawed bill” which A “strips a woman of her right to choose.” Breaux added: “The decision whether to have a baby is a complicated balancing of responsibilities and opportunities that must be weighed by each woman, not made by politicians or Supreme Court justices.” The bill passed out of a Senate committee on Tuesday, with some Republican members voting for the bill but hoping it would be amended. The committee also held extensive public debate earlier in the week, with dozens of individuals, from doctors to faith leaders to private citizens, voicing their opinions on the bill. While some objected to the bill for the limits it placed on abortion, others opposed the measure over its exceptions or what they described as vague language. Anti-abortion group National Right to Life and its Indiana affiliate had expressed opposition to the bill prior to it passing the state Senate, calling it “deeply flawed” and a “weak and troubling” measure. “The bill fails substantively in many areas, including its failure to provide any meaningful enforcement provisions. This bill goes through the motions on paper, but lacks any teeth to actually reduce abortions in Indiana by holding those who perform abortions or would intentionally skirt the law accountable with criminal consequences,” Indiana Right to Life said in a statement.",Jean Breaux;Susan Glick;Suzanne Crouch,National Right To Life;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Us Supreme Court;Cnn;Cnn,"BAN,79;BAN,612;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,514;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,2328;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,2500;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,2814;LEADER,225;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,225;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,225;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,225;PROTEST,1614;PROTEST,1687;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2551;WB_840_JUSTICE,2551;CONSTITUTIONAL,1129;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2958;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIANS,2526;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,2834;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,3551;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,772;GENERAL_HEALTH,2797;MEDICAL,2797;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTORS,2797;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2797;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1494;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1864;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2629;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1961;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1464;DEMOCRACY,2257;TRANSPARENCY,3537;RAPE,707;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,707;TAX_FNCACT_PRIVATE_CITIZENS,2834;LEGISLATION,468;LEGISLATION,3525;EPU_POLICY_LAW,468;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3525;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,115;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,2402;",Indiana;West Virginia
179,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/world/cool-cities-heat-wave-climate-cmd-intl/,"Blistering heat has returned to western Europe, as some countries like France enter into their third wave of the summer with temperatures expected to reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), while more than 80% of the US population will experience temperatures over 90 degrees (32C) within the next week, including in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Around 100 million Americans have been under heat alerts for eight of the past 16 days.  This means hundreds of millions of people living in urban areas are again desperately trying to stay cool. The climate crisis is making extreme heat more frequent and last longer — but cities, without thoughtful design, can make life even hotter. Air conditioners might keep the indoors cool, but they only add to heat outdoors. And in most cases, they are adding to the climate crisis by increasing planet-warming emissions. Public transportation may be unbearable on a hot day, but driving a car that runs on gas instead just worsens traffic, also adding to heat and emissions. A lack of trees means a lack of shade, and buildings made of dark materials bring hotter interiors, which means more air conditioning.  It’s a vicious cycle, but there are other solutions.  Here’s how eight cities are taking some of the heat out of their summers. Medellín, Colombia: Grow trees on the streets, not just in parks When it gets really hot, people with air conditioning might stay indoors, but not everyone has that luxury and — well, who wants to say in all the time?  For cities that aren’t on the coast, parks that offer shade are a good option. Colombia’s second-largest city, Medellín, however, has created an entire metropolis of shade with its award-winning Green Corridors project.  The web-like network has transformed 18 roads and 12 waterways into lush green cycling lanes and walkways that connect the city’s parks and other frequently visited sites.  Temperatures have come down in these areas and their surrounds by as much as 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (around 3 degrees Celsius), and officials hope that before 2030, it could shave off up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius). “Urban forests are the very best thing for city heat,” Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock) at the Atlantic Council, told CNN. “Medellín has dropped the city’s average summer temperature, which is remarkable.” By 2019, the city had planted more than 8,000 trees and over 350,000 shrubs. It also uses an area beneath a raised Metro line to collect rainwater that flows down from the bridge, capturing it in a system of pipes to help water the green belts.  Vienna: Splish, splash, splosh Like in much of Europe, many in Vienna don’t have air conditioning, so water is a big part of how the Austrian capital keeps cool.  For those who don’t have time for a dip in the Danube, the city offers cooling parks with mist-spraying “trees” that people can either “shower” in, or just sit near to enjoy the cooler temperatures they bring their surrounds.  Children, who are generally more vulnerable to extreme heat than adults, are often seen playing in the city’s splash pools or running around in pop-up water features — typically hosepipes with holes punched in them — that the city government brings out on the hottest of days, including in areas like Karlsplatz, a popular city square.  Vienna also has a huge number of water fountains for drinking to keep people hydrated — more than 1,100 for its population of 1.9 million — which is important in preventing heat-related illness.  “Air conditioning in homes may sound like a quick and easy solution. But it’s not a long-term sustainable solution because of the source of the power and the waste heat that comes off the unit,” McLeod said. “So thinking about how to get more airflow, use water features and get windows to open in some of the oldest buildings is key. The nature-based solutions are the best for extreme heat.” Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates: Use old cooling techniques and modernize them Parts of the Middle East are some of the hottest inhabited places on Earth. Temperatures in Abu Dhabi can climb to more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit (over 50 Celsius). Air conditioning is seen as a necessity, and people tend to spend a lot of time indoors.  But people here haven’t always had air conditioning, and an ancient Arabic architectural cooling technique has made a comeback — with a modern twist.   Mashrabiya refers to the latticed screens often seen in Islamic architecture, sometimes surrounding a small balcony, that diffuse sunlight and keep buildings cool without completely blocking light. They are designed to encourage a breeze and offer a spot of respite from the heat within a building. The idea is essentially to stop direct sunlight landing on a building’s exterior.  That’s what inspired the design of Al Bahar Towers, a 25-story building wrapped in more than 1,000 hexagonal shades with built-in sensors that allow them to respond to the sun’s movements. When the sun hits the shades, they unfold like an umbrella to ward off the heat. Without these measures, the outside of such a building in Abu Dhabi could reach as high as 200 degrees (around 90 Celsius).  The technique has helped reduce the building’s need for air conditioning by 50%. Cool, huh? Miami: Target heat traps  In a lot of cities, catching the bus can mean a long wait. If it’s really hot, the wait can be all the more punishing — unless, of course, that bus stop has been thoughtfully engineered to include natural shade. Medellín in Colombia may have proved that urban forests, or simply planting more trees, can cool a city a down, but Miami’s Dade county has put a lot of thought into exactly which parts of the city need cooling the most.  Neat Streets Miami, a board convened by the county council, recognized that bus stops had become real danger zones during heat waves, so they planted trees around 10 stops. They wrote a guide on which trees work best and where to plant them so that other areas could replicate the project.  And that they have. There are now 71 green bus stops in the country,  most of them by communities that applied to the government for resources to green their own bus stops.  To make it more fun, the organizers also held a haiku poetry competition, and selected the best 10 to etch into the sidewalks by the original stops.  Here’s one of them:  The trees have also  missed their bus — look how they wave  their many sad arms — Ariel Francisco  Athens: Work with what you’ve got  Not every city has an ancient aqueduct at their disposal, but the Greek capital of Athens does. The Hadrian aqueduct was once used as a main source of water, using a system of pipes that worked with gravity to allow water to flow from its source to the city for human consumption. The water today isn’t drinkable, but the city is looking at ways to salvage the 800,000 cubic meters of water that flows off as waste into the sea each year. One use will be to irrigate new greenbelts to run all along the 20 kilometer structure, which should help take the heat out of the areas around it. The water will also be used for misting, like in Vienna. Even for cities without infrastructure quite this old, Athens is a good reminder that defunct water systems can sometime be revived. Los Angeles: Paint the town white This one is a little more controversial.  Some cities have experimented with painting rooftops white to reflect sunlight and keep buildings cool, but Los Angeles went a step further and is painting entire roads white. Dark things like asphalt absorbs sunlight and emits that energy back into the air as heat. Painting the asphalt white would theoretically nip that process in the bud, and lead to cooler air temperatures. The idea has some merit. Researchers Ariane Middel and V. Kelly Turner found that technique did cool the streets themselves by around 10 degrees. But there was a major knock-on effect. The same researchers also said it was likely the extra heat reflecting off the roads was being absorbed by … people.  That means if you’re a few blocks away, the white streets may help you feel cooler, but if you’re on the street, you could actually feel hotter. Nonetheless, LA is continuing with this program to see what works and what doesn’t. It currently uses a grayish-white substance called CoolSeal, once used to help hide grounded aircraft from satellites, but it’s possible that another type of paint could yield different results.  Painting rooftops has had greater success.  Results vary depending on the level of heat and materials a roof is made of, but in places like Ahmedabad in India, which gets seriously hot, cool roofs have shaved 3-8 degrees Fahrenheit of the heat in homes. According to Berkeley Lab’s Heat Island Group, a black roof could be as much at 54 degrees (around 30 Celsius) hotter than a white roof.  Another option is the green roof. Cities all around the world have created “gardens in the sky” to cool down buildings. Paris: Get really organized The French capital gets seriously hot.  Temperatures there have surpassed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) this summer, but the combination of high-rise buildings, limestone monuments and busy asphalt roads means it can feel even hotter.  The city has a strong urban heat island effect, where it is often 18 degrees hotter in the city center on a summer’s day than it is in the Parisian hinterlands. But Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has been credited with putting in place some of the world’s most innovative measures to combat heat, and the city’s heat plan is truly comprehensive.  The main result is a city full of “cool islands.” Parisians can use an app called EXTREMA to guide them to more than 800 cool spots — parks, water fountains and air-conditioned museums, for example — and get there via a naturally cooled walkway. The idea is that a cool island is always a maximum seven minutes’ walk away for everyone.  Like Vienna, Paris uses mist machines on hot days. It also has dozens of new “splash fountains,” in addition to its many traditional fountains, which are very shallow pools with fountain-like effects.  Paris’ heat plan involves a register that identifies the most vulnerable, so officials can check up on them by phone and offer advice on staying cool. Kindergartens get temporary air conditioners in their classrooms, and public parks and pools stay open for longer hours into the night. And like LA, Paris is trying to take the heat out of its roads and sidewalks by “demineralizing them,” using more porous materials. Now that sounds like a plan. Seville, Spain: Name your heat waves The world has been naming hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons for decades for a reason: A named storm makes you sit up and pay attention. The southern Spanish city of Seville is taking that approach with heat waves, becoming world’s first to do so.  The July heat wave there was named Zoe. “Naming heat waves is a positive thing because it means we’re recognizing how lethal they are, and that they’re here to stay. It’s not a fluke heat wave,” the Arsht-Rock’s McLeod said. “This is this is something we’re going to be living with for a long time, no matter what we do with our emissions.” But there’s more to what Seville is doing than naming. Arsht-Rock is working with Seville on a new categorization system for heat waves based on projected negative health outcomes. The idea is to avoid scientific jargon that most people don’t understand and link alert levels to what a heat wave is likely to do to people.  A 2018 Brown University study of 20 heat warning systems in the United States found that only Philadelphia’s heat warning system was effective in saving lives, partly because it uses health-based metrics. “Besides physical interventions for heat, naming and categorizing heat waves is the best, most immediate thing you can do,” McLeod said. “Because that’s the key — heat is killing people, and that’s because people are not aware of the magnitude of the problem.” CNN’s Taylor Ward, Schams Elwazer and Vanessa Ko contributed to this story.",Ariel Francisco;Abu Dhabi Al Bahar;Abu Dhabi Al Bahar;Miami Dade;Schwarzenberg Square;Schams Elwazer;Kathy Baughman Mcleod;Vanessa Ko;Angela Dewan;Anne Hidalgo;Abu Dhabi;Abu Dhabi;Abu Dhabi;Abu Dhabi;Abu Dhabi;Adrienne Arsht;Los Angeles;Los Angeles;Los Angeles;Ariane Middel,Atlantic Council;Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center Arsht;Brown University;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States;United States,"KILL,12868;TAX_FNCACT_GUIDE,6522;TAX_FNCACT_GUIDE,10580;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2342;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,6162;WB_1777_FORESTS,2342;WB_1777_FORESTS,6162;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2342;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,6162;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,979;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,2902;NATURAL_DISASTER_TYPHOONS,11631;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,487;ARMEDCONFLICT,10422;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVE,11837;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVE,12007;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVE,12441;EDUCATION,11243;GENERAL_HEALTH,3915;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,647;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,911;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRIAN,3114;TAX_RELIGION_ISLAMIC,5023;ENV_SOLAR,4427;ENV_SOLAR,4516;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,654;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,918;TAX_ETHNICITY_SPANISH,11727;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SPANISH,11727;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,4876;WB_135_TRANSPORT,979;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,48;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,130;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,508;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,677;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,852;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1096;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1344;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2380;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3420;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,4077;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,4297;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5237;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5591;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5831;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,6456;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,7750;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,8082;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,8385;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,8740;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,9312;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,9473;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,9529;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,10157;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,10427;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,10445;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,11040;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,11364;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,11511;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,11777;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,11832;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,11872;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12002;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12278;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12436;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12508;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12594;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12727;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12756;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12857;TRAFFIC,1074;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3611;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6747;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3611;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6747;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,2415;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,7458;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,9147;WB_2120_SATELLITES,9147;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,9147;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,9147;SCIENCE,8537;SCIENCE,8701;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,11609;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,785;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1230;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1600;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3056;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3922;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4719;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4841;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5776;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,8377;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,8484;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,11210;MEDICAL,12319;TAX_ETHNICITY_FRENCH,9896;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_FRENCH,9896;URBAN,586;URBAN,2334;URBAN,6154;URBAN,10152;WB_574_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ADAPTATION,4267;WB_576_ECOSYSTEM_BASED_ADAPTATION,4267;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,4267;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,6462;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,11517;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,11783;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,11878;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,12284;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,12762;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,12491;MARITIME_INCIDENT,2780;MARITIME,2780;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,12639;WB_137_WATER,2830;WB_137_WATER,2929;WB_137_WATER,3080;WB_137_WATER,3514;WB_137_WATER,3757;WB_137_WATER,4170;WB_137_WATER,7173;WB_137_WATER,7346;WB_137_WATER,7412;WB_137_WATER,7483;WB_137_WATER,7583;WB_137_WATER,7788;WB_137_WATER,7956;WB_137_WATER,10627;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,5509;TAX_FNCACT_ORGANIZERS,6830;TAX_ETHNICITY_ARAB,4323;SOC_INNOVATION,10403;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,8036;GOV_LOCALGOV,3611;LEADER,10316;TAX_FNCACT_MAYOR,10316;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2247;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,11116;ENV_WATERWAYS,2005;WB_1805_WATERWAYS,2005;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2005;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,654;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,918;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,654;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,918;TAX_ETHNICITY_GREEK,7253;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_GREEK,7253;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,9552;",Philadelphia;Spanish;Colombia;India;Athens;Austrian;Ahmedabad;Paris;France;Americans;Spain;United States;Vienna;Berkeley;United Arab Emirates;French;Greek;Austria

550,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/college-campuses-monkeypox/,"With nearly 9,000 confirmed monkeypox cases nationwide, there is growing concern that US college and university campuses could become monkeypox “hotspots” this fall.  Educators are working to reduce the public health risk while some students worry about how their campus experiences might be affected by the virus – a virus that the nation is still trying to control and that was recently declared a national public health emergency.  “As we head into the fall, I’m concerned about outbreaks on college campuses as they are often a place where individuals engage in higher risk sexual activity and are in close contact with many different people,” Dr. Rachel Cox, an assistant professor in the School of Nursing at the MGH Institute of Health Professions, said in an email to CNN. “We need to make sure we’re prepared to allocate resources like tests, vaccines, and antivirals to places that may become hotspots.” Sydney Greenstein, an 18-year-old incoming freshman at New York University, said that while he’s excited to begin his college experience, he has concerns about his risk of exposure in New York City, which has one of the highest numbers of monkeypox cases in the country. There are 1,937 confirmed or probable cases in New York City, according to the NYC Department of Health. “It’s definitely put a consideration into school and what my plans are and how I’m going to, you know, be social and interact with people and go out,” Greenstein said. Greenstein will be moving from Maryland to New York at the end of this month to start school and said he has not heard much from NYU about its monkeypox response plans. NYU did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. But some universities told CNN that their response plans involve the infectious disease protocols they already have in place. A continuation of work  Elon University in North Carolina sees the preparations for a potential response to monkeypox as an extension of work the school has been doing.   “We are aware that we may have cases of monkeypox. We have been working on preparing for it since May, so long before it was seen as a problem, and our focus is going to be very much on education, prevention, but we have plans should there be a case,” said Dr. Ginette Archinal, medical director of student health and university physician. ” ‘Concerned’ is overstating it, but we are prepared for cases of monkeypox on campus.”  Elon’s infectious disease response team “has been in preparation mode for many infectious diseases,” for the past several years, said Jana Lynn Patterson, Elon’s associate vice president for student life and dean of students. Archinal and Patterson make up the leadership team of Elon’s Infectious Disease Response Team.  The school had a mumps outbreak in fall 2019, which Patterson said made them better prepared for Covid, and they see the monkeypox response as “a continuation of our work.”  “We have some basic infectious disease response protocols, and then we have refined them based on the current information we have around specific information or specific needs around a monkeypox case or an outbreak,” she said.   The protocols cover several areas including isolation should it be needed, academic support, educational support and making sure clinical and health staff are up to date around assessments. Archinal and Patterson also stressed the importance of their relationship with the local health department and health system.  They were very intentional during Covid that any policies or protocols that were created could be applied to any infectious disease that came up in the future.  “Elon has protocols for this type of infectious disease that are deliberately designed to be tweaked based on what may be emerging,” Archinal said. “Because why reinvent the wheel at the last minute every time there’s an outbreak when you can have a solid, firm plan in place that you just tweak to make appropriate for each one, and that’s really about the preparation.” According to the CDC, there are 111 monkeypox cases in North Carolina as of August 8.  Opportunities for monkeypox to spread Elon is not the only school that intends to focus on education about the virus. At Florida A&M, there is some concern about monkeypox spreading on campus.   Students there “like engaging in a lot of different activities and socializing and everything, so I think there are certainly opportunities for monkeypox to be spread amongst the population,” said Tanya Tatum, director of student health services at Florida A&M.  Tatum noted that monkeypox isn’t like Covid-19, which primarily spreads through the air. But officials know that students engage in intimate activities. A recent study found that among 528 infections diagnosed during the current outbreak, 95% were suspected to have been transmitted during sexual activity. The fact that the virus can be viable on inanimate objects such as bedsheets also adds to concerns. “Some of our students aren’t the best housekeepers, how often are bedsheets changed and things like that,” she said. “So there is some concern.”   The CDC says the most common way monkeypox spreads is from person to person through direct contact with the rash, scabs or body fluids of someone who’s been infected. Such contact can happen during intimate activities such as sex. However, the virus can also spread if a person touches an object, fabric or surface that has been contaminated.    The plan at Florida A&M is to embark on an education campaign, Tatum said, so students are aware that the virus is spreading.  Florida A&M will have a website with information up at the end of the week, Tatum said. The plan also includes emails to employees and students, information on the student engagement platform and flyers posted in residence halls. “Our students start moving back on campus Monday, August 15th. We will be pushing our information starting this week and will provide periodic messaging throughout the semester,” Tatum said.   “We want people to understand how it spreads and ways which they can avoid that, either picking it up or spreading it further,” she said. “We also want to make sure that they understand and are knowledgeable about what the treatment might be and what to do if they think they may have possibly been exposed.” The University of North Florida is also focusing on education, said Dr. Valerie Morrison, director of Student Health Services.  The university wants to make sure students know what to do when they think they might be sick from monkeypox or another infectious disease. This includes staying home and knowing how to reach student health services or a primary care provider.  The University of North Florida plans to reach students by including educational information on social media platforms like Instagram.  According to the CDC’s count, Florida has the third-highest case count in the United States, with 936 cases as of August 8. Texas A&M is also making efforts to educate its students.  “We have an active webpage and social media content ready to send to our students,” Dr. Martha Dannenbaum, director of Student Health Services at Texas A&M, told CNN in an email. “We have well established processes for pushing out educational content to our students which we will continue to follow. “University Health Centers are intimately involved with public health efforts on their campuses so managing potential outbreaks of monkey pox or other new infectious diseases is part of the work we do,” Dannenbaum wrote. “Most (including Texas A&M Student Health) were very involved in the planning and execution of the plans for their campus related to COVID. We can expect a similar response to monkeypox.” Texas has 702 monkeypox cases as of August 8, according to the CDC.  Testing and isolation plans for students  “I think that colleges should definitely have ways to test available and also have solutions and plans for if someone’s infected. You know, like what surfaces do they come into contact with a lot? How can they clean that off to minimize the spread?” said Greenstein, the incoming NYU student.   Several universities said they were able to test for the virus, although it often involved an outside lab.  “Currently, tests can only be done at labs authorized to perform the tests,” a spokesperson for the American College Health Association told CNN in an email. “College health professionals may collect specimens and send them to these labs if it is determined that a patient needs a test.” The association is working on developing resources to help campuses prevent and manage outbreaks.   Florida A&M, Texas A&M, North Florida and Elon said they can perform tests for monkeypox on campus. In some cases, the specimens will be sent to a partner lab.  When it comes to isolation, North Florida’s Morrison said that because of how monkeypox spreads, developing isolation policies can be complicated and may need to happen on a case-by-case basis.   The ways monkeypox can spread – including through contaminated objects, like laundry, clothing and towels – affects the mechanics of how a person can effectively isolate in a campus setting.  “If we had to isolate someone on-campus, we would want a room that’s a single room that has its own bathroom where a person would isolate, and my recommendation would be that there’s no porous-type furniture in there. You wouldn’t want an upholstery type of thing, no rugs, because it makes it easier to keep clean afterwards,” Morrison said. Elon’s Archinal also said the university can isolate students with monkeypox, should the need arise. “I have written protocols for my staff on what to look out for, how to manage it. We already have the ability to test for it. We know which lab we send the tests to. We have protocols already in place about when we isolate, who we isolate, what things we look out for and when we notify our health department,” Archinal said.  She added that officials have an automated system in place for Covid that notifies the relevant people on campus of which students may need to be taken care of in isolation. The same process, if needed, will be used for monkeypox. No recommendation for mass vaccination Colleges have also been considering how monkeypox vaccination might come into play for students.  Archinal and Patterson said Elon is ready if there is a need for a vaccination clinic on campus, and its partnership with the local health department plays into this.   If the vaccine becomes more available, they will consult with the state, and if they and the local health department feel that the school is a good candidate for a clinic, that can be deployed in less than 24 hours, Patterson said, similar to what happened during the mumps outbreak. Many other schools also plan to follow local health department guidelines and policies concerning vaccine distribution. The CDC has been sending states supply of monkeypox vaccine, called Jynneos, for people who have been exposed to or are at risk of exposure to the virus.  According to the CDC, those eligible for vaccination include confirmed contacts of someone with monkeypox, presumed contacts who had a sex partner in the past 14 days diagnosed with monkeypox, those who had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area where monkeypox is spreading and those who may be exposed to the virus through their job. Archinal stressed that there is no recommendation from the CDC for blanket vaccination and said Elon will not suggest such a strategy if there is no need. During the school mumps outbreak, although all students had received the standard two vaccines, the health department recommended a booster dose.   “Within 24 hours, they were on campus doing vaccine clinics, booster doses,” Archinal said. “Our discussion with the health department is that should that same situation arise and the event there was expanded advice to get vaccines and they were available, our health department would be capable of doing the same thing.” Tatum, at Florida A&M, said that if vaccines become more available, officials there will follow health department guidance. Florida has the vaccine, she said, but it’s being distributed and administered through the health department.  She said that if there is a time where there is enough vaccine, the university sees rising numbers of cases and the health department recommends vaccination, “it may be a possibility that we might offer it.” A call for communication  Greenstein, the incoming NYU student, said he hopes that universities proactively communicate with students about their plans to mitigate spread and how they expect monkeypox might affect the school year. “I would just ask that there’s some form of communication,” Greenstein said. “This doesn’t have to be your top priority – I completely understand the rush of getting everything ready in time – but some form of communication would be nice.”  He also hopes that his school is mindful of how it communicates information about the virus and does not stigmatize men who have sex with men or imply that the outbreak should only concern this community, which has seen a large majority of the cases in this outbreak.  “I think they should definitely keep in mind that their words have power,” Greenstein said. “What they say can definitely be taken in the wrong way.”  CNN’s Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",Ginette Archinal;Tanya

149,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/russian-bitcoin-extradited-us/,"A Russian national accused of running a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly profited from various hacking and extortion schemes has been extradited from Greece and is on his way to the US, according to the suspect’s lawyer. Alexander Vinnik, who is in his early 40s, is accused of operating a cryptocurrency exchange known as BTC-e that allegedly did business with ransomware gangs, drug dealers and identity thieves, according to the Justice Department. He faces charges in the US Northern District Court of California of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money service business in the US, among other charges. Vinnik’s extradition is a significant win for US law enforcement officials, who had been in a high-stakes extradition fight with Russia to gain custody of Vinnik.  Frédéric Bélot, Vinnik’s lawyer in France, told CNN Thursday afternoon that his client was on a plane from Athens, Greece, to the US, where he is expected to make an initial court appearance in the US Northern District of California. Bélot said that Vinnik maintains his innocence.  Vinnik’s extradition shows how US prosecutors have continued to pursue high-profile Russian cybercrime suspects at a time when any faint hopes of cooperation with Moscow on the issue have dimmed.   Vinnik was arrested in 2017 in Greece and subsequently extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for money laundering. But Vinnik has also been under indictment in US since 2017, and the US and Russia filed dueling extradition requests from Greece. BTC-e, which shut down in 2017, received more than $4 billion worth of bitcoin while it was operating, according to the Justice Department.  The Treasury Department in 2017 assessed a $110 million civil money penalty against the cryptocurrency exchange “for willfully violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws” and a $12 million fee against Vinnik.",Alexander Vinnik,Us Northern District Court;Treasury Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn,"WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,468;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1730;WB_840_JUSTICE,468;WB_840_JUSTICE,1730;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,783;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1320;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1560;CORRUPTION,565;CORRUPTION,1485;ECON_MONEYLAUNDERING,565;ECON_MONEYLAUNDERING,1485;WB_2076_MONEY_LAUNDERING,565;WB_2076_MONEY_LAUNDERING,1485;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,565;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1485;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,565;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1485;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,244;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,861;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,441;TAX_FNCACT_THIEVES,441;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1368;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1368;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,1459;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1459;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1459;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1459;ECON_BITCOIN,78;ECON_BITCOIN,333;ECON_BITCOIN,1841;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,1757;WB_1045_TREASURY,1757;ECON_IDENTITYTHEFT,441;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,385;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,614;CYBER_ATTACK,132;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,712;DRUG_TRADE,414;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,414;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,414;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,414;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,414;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,414;ORGANIZED_CRIME,407;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,407;WB_2452_GANGS,407;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,407;WB_2445_NON_STATE_SECURITY_ACTORS,407;ARREST,799;TRIAL,34;TRIAL,306;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,14;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1234;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,14;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1234;SECURITY_SERVICES,712;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,712;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,712;LEGISLATION,700;EPU_POLICY_LAW,700;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,722;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,1189;",Russian;Athens;France;Russia;Moscow;Greece;California
124,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/joe-biden-abortion-executive-order/,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order to help ensure access to abortion in light of the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer to eliminate the constitutional right to the procedure. The President said the order helps women travel out of state to receive abortions, ensures health care providers comply with federal law so women aren’t delayed in getting care and advances research and data collection “to evaluate the impact that this reproductive health crisis is having on maternal health and other health conditions and outcomes.” Biden spoke of the “chaos and uncertainty” that has ensued in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision and said, “Women’s health and lives are on the line.” “Emergency medical care being denied to women experiencing miscarriages, doctors uncertain about what they can do to provide for their patients, pharmacists unsure whether they can fill prescriptions that they’ve always filled before, a tragic case of rape survivors, including a 10-year-old girl forced to travel to another state for care,” Biden said before signing the order.  The order comes the day after Kansas voters handed abortion-rights advocates a massive victory and defeating a measure that would have allowed the GOP-led legislature to impose new restrictions. It was a vote that Biden celebrated at the White House. “In a decisive victory, voters made it clear that politicians should not interfere with the fundamental rights of women. And the voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall the American people will vote to preserve and protect the right and refuse to let them be ripped away by politicians,” Biden said at the event. “And my administration has their back.” Biden signed the executive order during the inaugural meeting of the administration’s recently established Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, which is comprised of representatives from multiple departments across the federal government. Cabinet members briefed the President on steps their respective agencies have taken to defend reproductive rights.  The order directs Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to consider “all appropriate actions to ensure health care providers comply with federal non-discrimination laws so that women receive medically necessary care without delay,” including steps to provide health care providers with technical and legal guidance amid the patchwork of state legal restrictions on abortion care following the Supreme Court’s decision.  Last month, CNN reported doctors have struggled to navigate byzantine guidance as states across the country pass increasingly strict abortion restrictions, with experts warning of “an enormous chilling effect” on doctors performing miscarriage surgeries even when doctors “are confident that what they’re doing is within the letter of the law.” Wednesday’s order also directs HHS to consider actions guaranteeing women traveling across state lines seeking abortions have access to health care services, including through Medicaid. Last month, a bill guaranteeing women the right to travel across state lines to seek abortions failed to pass the Senate after Republicans blocked the measure. According to a senior administration official, that would allow states to provide care for out-of-state patients seeking abortions through a Medicaid 1115 waiver, permitting states to waive certain state-based requirements in providing care and assist in covering “certain costs.”  The executive order further directs HHS to expand research efforts on maternal health data, “to accurately measure the impact that diminishing access to reproductive health care services has on women’s health,” the official said Tuesday. Pressed Wednesday on how the president’s executive order on reproductive care avoids running afoul of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to perform abortions, White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said the Department of Health and Human Services will “come up with the details on the specifics on how they’re gonna work with states” to provide care via Medicaid waivers. “So, as you know, Medicaid provides comprehensive health care to women with low incomes – this care includes family planning services such as contraception, non-emergency medical, transportation, and support services like targeted case management, which allows health care providers to help patients coordinate their care,” Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee. “And it also includes abortion care in certain circumstances, as accepted by the Hyde Amendment, which is rape, incest and life of the mother.” The executive order, Jean-Pierre told Lee, “will cover care that is otherwise part of Medicaid,” including non-emergency medical travel and other health care services. She added, “The Hyde Amendment is law and we’re gonna, we’re gonna follow that law.” Wednesday’s executive order is the second one signed by Biden in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Last month, Biden signed an order that he said would safeguard access to abortion care and contraceptives, protect patient privacy and establish an interagency task force to use “every federal tool available to protect access to reproductive health care.” Ultimately, however, there is no action the President can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, and Biden has publicly acknowledged that his options to expand abortion access remain limited.

547,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/children-making-friends-school-pandemic-wellness/,"Editor’s Note: This story is the second in a series looking at ways we can help our children restore, with patience and love, some of what the pandemic has taken away.  The past few pandemic years have not made for ideal circumstances for our children to make or deepen friendships.  At first, there was physical isolation, a clear and obvious hindrance to building or maintaining connection. Then we moved on to navigating each individual family’s Covid-19 policies. Sure, our kids want to hang out. But are the parents and caregivers on the same page with masking, open windows and runny-nose monitoring? This was hard enough to determine with old friends, let alone with a family we’d just met.  Things loosened, many parents and caregivers let their guards down a bit, but by then the kids were rusty. Maybe they had friends, but from the parents’ and caregivers’ perspective, something was missing: an intimacy or dependency they recalled from their childhood friendships. Or maybe your kids went through the school year without reporting much in the way of anything about friends, new or old. Sometimes, this lack of  connection didn’t even seem to bother them.   “There was nothing we could do about social setbacks,” said Anya Kamenetz, an education reporter and author of the upcoming book “The Stolen Year: How COVID Changed Children’s Lives, and Where We Go Now.”  “Now there is some social catching up to do.” Odds are that all of our kids could use a little help rebuilding social ties as they enter this school year. Here are some ways to approach this latest challenge.  The challenge: Parents and caregivers, we can help our kids make new friends, and deepen friendships with current friends without embarrassing them on the playground or in group texts. Helicopter parenting is not necessary. Why it’s important: Friendships are an essential part of childhood, experts say. Not only for the self-evident reasons that connecting with others feels good, but also because they create important developmental opportunities that lead to higher functioning at school and in life.  “For young people, a lot of how they are building their identity is through their peers,” said Karen VanAusdal, senior director of practice at CASEL, the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning. “Friendships are the places where we get to try out new ideas, practice new social skills, branch out of our comfort zone, and share our feelings.” As important as family bonds are, friends provide a critical social outlet outside the family, where children can have more space to figure out who they are, she said. Here are several expert-approved ways to approach it. Start at the beginning “Kids need to practice small things, like introducing themselves. Things as simple as “Hello, my name is … What is your name? Do you want to play with me?” VanAusdal said. “Help them with conversation starters, how to talk about apologizing and sharing, and have them practice with their family first.”  Last week, our 5-year-old – who tends to struggle in new social situations – had his first kindergarten playdate. As we were preparing him for meeting his new classmates the night before, I put this advice to work. Sadly, we had never explicitly taught him how to introduce himself before.  He didn’t exactly ace it the next day — according to his reports, he forgot to share his name, or ask kids their names — but that script in his head made him feel more comfortable going up to new kids and asking them if they wanted to play.  Model curiosity  “I think parents can help their kids develop deeper friendships by asking their kids questions about their friends,” said Maurice J. Elias, professor of psychology at Rutgers University in New Jersey and coauthor of “Emotionally Intelligent Parenting.” “One of the reasons friendships aren’t as deep, is because a lot of times kids are just focused on themselves.”  If your kids are like mine, they won’t know the answer to half of the questions you ask them about their friends, new and old. But I have noticed that our asking those questions on a regular basis has made our children excited to share any new details they learn about their friends with us. (Except for the times when they let me know there are secrets involved, which is a sign of curiosity, too.)  Modeling curiosity can take place in fictional realms as well. “Read books or watch movies together, and then talk about how the character is feeling. It is a really great way to have a conversation about feelings,” Kamenetz said. In my experience, kids might not put the lessons they took from “Trolls World Tour” and their classroom dynamic together immediately, but these insights tend to seep out over time, and in meaningful ways.  You can also talk about your own life, which isn’t as exciting as a movie or TV show but has the added value of being real. “Share examples of how friendship is important for you, so young people begin to understand the value of maintaining friendships over time,” VanAusdal said. Be open about potential friends We parents and caregivers, whether we realize it or not, tend to have ideas about who is a suitable friend for our children, and who isn’t. Kamenetz suggests we broaden our ideas about what kind of friends our kids might make, and where those friends might come from. “Some kids are going to do better with kids that are younger, and some might do better with kids who are older. Be supportive of that, too.”  Preach inclusivity. Be proactive about making sure your kids know that everyone belongs, and everyone is potential friend material. “We can all think of ways of how to be better allies and work on being more inclusive of kids in our class who are neurodivergent, or who come from different races or religions (than our family),” Kamenetz said.  One bonus about discussing inclusivity in our house is that it has made our kids feel more comfortable about their differences — whether it’s a quirky hobby, or the fact that we are Jewish. By envisioning a world that is an inclusive place, they see themselves as belonging too, and enter social situations a little more sure-footed.  Limit playdate screentime This one is an evergreen, but try, if you can, to encourage analog play.  “Friendships can get stuck in the stage of parallel play for too long, because of electronic devices,” Elias said. Parallel play, which is common in very young children, is when children are playing next to each other, but not engaging with each other. This kind of play makes it hard to connect through conversation, which is the bread and butter of lasting relationships, he said.  For kids who might need a small dose of digital time to help feel comfortable socializing again, Elias suggests trying to get them to play a game that is collaborative. “Make sure there is interaction and conversation, and they are working together on something,” he said.  Take it slow Whether they have clinically diagnosed anxiety disorder or they are neurodiverse or a little extra sensitive to the social stresses of the pandemic, there are some kids who will need more hand-holding or support than others when it comes to repairing friendships and friend-making. The most important thing is to take it slow, experts say.   All of the above guidance may take longer, or happen in fits and starts or small doses, and that’s OK. Getting the school involved can help, too. Kamentez said she has heard of some schools doing lunch bunches — small groups of kids who eat lunch with a teacher in a classroom, or somewhere else far away from the potentially overwhelming cafeteria. “My younger daughter was expressing angst about birthday parties,” Kamentez said. “But I knew it was not helpful to just say to her ‘Hey, why don’t you want to go to a birthday party! They are fun,’ and instead tell her that we just have to go for five minutes, and then we can leave.”  The first time, they followed that plan. But each consecutive time they stayed longer and longer, and her daughter had more and more fun — all at the pace that worked for her. Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter.

185,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/asia/pakistan-imran-khan-illegal-funds-election-agency-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan’s election commission ruled on Tuesday that former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s political party received millions of dollars in illegal funds from foreign countries, including the United States, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, and Australia. The decision could lead to a ban on Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which rose to prominence on an anti-corruption drive. Khan, who analysts say had fallen out with military powers over the appointment of a spy chief in the run up to his ouster earlier this year, was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for the PTI party denied any wrongdoing. The commission’s ruling is a major setback for the former cricket star who has been leading a campaign against the new government. The case, filed in 2014 by Akbar S. Khan, a PTI founding member, accused the party of receiving illegal funds from abroad. “The commission is satisfied that the contributions and donations have been received by the respondent party from prohibited sources,” the ruling, which has been seen by Reuters, said. The commission said the party also hid 13 accounts, adding that the declaration submitted to the commission about the party finances by Khan as its chairman from 2008 to 2013 were “found to be grossly inaccurate.” It said the PTI received funds from different people and companies abroad, including business tycoon Arif Naqvi, owner of a Dubai-based equity group, who is among several people charged by U.S. prosecutors with being part of an international scheme to defraud investors, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Naqvi has denied the charges. The commission said the party was “willing recipient of prohibited money” amounting to $2.1 million from Naqvi’s Wootton Cricket Limited, which is registered in the Cayman Islands. It also identified several other foreign accounts in the United States, Britain, Australia, UAE, Canada, Switzerland and other countries, which made transaction to Khan’s party accounts. The election commission ruling has been referred to the Pakistan government, which could seek a Supreme Court ban on Khan and his party from politics, according to legal experts. The court ordered the commission in 2017 to scrutinise the party’s accounts. “We will challenge this ruling,” Khan’s party spokesman, Fawad Chaudhry, told reporters. He said the funds were received from Pakistani nationals living overseas, which is not illegal.  Khan was prime minister from 2018 until April this year when he was forced to step down after losing a confidence vote which he alleged was the result of a US conspiracy. The United States denied that. Since then, he has been rallying his supporters to press his demand for a new election. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rejected that demand. “It is a clear case of fraud,” said Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, leader of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party.",Arif Naqvi;Shahid Khaqan Abbasi;Fawad Chaudhry;Shehbaz Sharif;Imran Khan;Imran Khan;Imran Khan,Supreme Court;Sharif Pakistan Muslim League;Naqvi Wootton Cricket;Melinda Gates Foundation;Reuters;Reuters;United States;United States;United States,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,789;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2140;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,789;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2140;BAN,317;BAN,2179;MEDIA_MSM,2404;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_PAKISTAN_TEHREEKE_INSAF,355;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,132;TAX_FNCACT_SPY,509;LEADER,111;LEADER,2748;LEADER,3029;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,111;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,2748;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,3029;TAX_RELIGION_MUSLIM,3163;TAX_ETHNICITY_MUSLIM,3163;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_PAKISTAN_MUSLIM_LEAGUE,3170;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_PAKISTAN_MUSLIM_LEAGUE,3170;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,618;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,2370;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,111;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,2748;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3029;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,2974;APPOINTMENT,500;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,515;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1605;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1273;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1416;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,3100;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,3100;ECON_DEVELOPMENTORGS_GATES_FOUNDATION,1661;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,3137;ACT_MAKESTATEMENT,1693;TAX_ETHNICITY_ARAB,237;TAX_ETHNICITY_ARAB,1466;ELECTION,56;ELECTION,2077;ELECTION,3013;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,138;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,365;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,636;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,875;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1035;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1145;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1240;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1726;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2052;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2199;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2305;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2360;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3176;CORRUPTION,413;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,413;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,413;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,413;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,442;TRIAL,1551;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,1551;",Pakistan;Britain;Canada;Australia;Cayman Islands;Pakistani;Switzerland;United States;Islamabad;Dubai;United Kingdom;United Arab Emirates
425,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/death-valley-national-park-flooding/,"Death Valley National Park announced its closure Friday due to substantial flooding within the park, according to a news release. “All roads into and out of the park are currently closed and will remain closed until park staff can assess the extensiveness of the situation,” the National Park Service said Friday. There were approximately 500 visitors and 500 staff at the park Friday, according to the agency, and stranded visitors can leave if they wish. No injuries have been reported. Abby Wines, public affairs officer for the National Park Service, told CNN Friday a number of visitors to Death Valley National Park have voluntarily left the park. Despite road closures, Wines says “no one is stopping” visitors if they find a way out of the park.  At The Inn at Death Valley, approximately 60 cars belonging to visitors and staff are buried under debris, according to a news release.  The park got 1.46 inches of rain, the second-wettest day since record keeping began in 1911, missing the record 1.47 inches by drops, according to CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.  It’s almost 70% of Death Valley’s average rainfall, and more than a 1,300% of its average August rain. In 61 years of the 111 years of record-keeping, the annual rainfall in the valley did not reach Friday’s amount, Javaheri said. About an inch of rain fell within an hour, something which happens on average every 1,000 years, according to Javaheri. Before Friday, Death Valley had only recorded 0.04 inches of rain in 2022, the driest start through July since 1953, when no rain fell at all. Wines says it is unclear when roads will reopen. The park remained closed Saturday as many roads there were “critically damaged” by the storm, according to the California Department of Transportation. “Drivers should not attempt to get around any closure to access the park,” Caltrans said in an update. Highway 190, which crosses the park west to east will stay closed through the weekend as crews work to clean it up, the update said.",,National Park Service;National Park Service;California Department Of Transportation;Cnn;Cnn,"NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,118;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,118;WB_168_ROADS_AND_HIGHWAYS,1475;WB_1809_HIGHWAYS,1475;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1475;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,10;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,658;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,880;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1074;AFFECT,460;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,460;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,46;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,325;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,597;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,694;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1110;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,46;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,325;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,597;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,694;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,1110;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,46;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,325;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,597;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,694;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,1110;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,46;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,325;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,597;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,694;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,1110;WB_1428_INJURY,505;WB_1406_DISEASES,505;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,505;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,505;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,505;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,569;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,569;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,926;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1035;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1417;",California;Furnace Creek;Death Valley

682,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/europe/eu-uk-drought-warnings-weather-climate-intl/,"Sixty-three percent of land in the European Union and United Kingdom – an area nearly the same size as India – is now under either drought warnings or alerts, according to data published by the European Drought Observatory on Wednesday. The new figures mark a slight increase from a 10-day period earlier in July, with 46% of land now covered by “warnings,” which means there is a deficit of moisture in the soil, while 17% is under the more severe level of “alert,” where vegetation is stressed. The area is also bigger than the US’ three largest states – Alaska, Texas and California – combined.  A map accompanying the data shows a high concentration of the more severe alert level in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary and Romania. An update on Wednesday by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology suggested that warmer-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average rainfall was likely to affect the southeast of the country, mostly England, until October. Water companies in these areas are considering more hosepipe bans on millions of customers in coming weeks. On Monday, the EU’s climate monitoring agency Copernicus said that much of Europe experienced a drier-than-average July, with several local records broken in the west for low rainfall and drought hitting several parts of southwestern and southeastern Europe.  In its monthly climate update, Copernicus said those conditions facilitated the spread and intensification of wildfires, fueled also by back-to-back heat waves in parts of Europe, in what is shaping up to be one of the continent’s hottest summers on record. The new data comes as the world grapples with a food crisis only just abating as Russia lifts its blockade of grain exports from Ukraine. Extreme weather and supply chain issues have worsened the crisis and are likely to persist for some time.  A recent report by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s science service, forecast a drop of 8-9% in the production of grain maize, sunflowers and soybeans in the EU because of hot and dry conditions over the summer, well below the five-year average. Copernicus Senior Scientist Freja Vamborg said that “dry conditions from previous months combined with high temperatures and low precipitation rates seen in many areas during July may have adverse effects on agricultural production and other industries such as river transport and energy production.” Months with little rain In July, water reservoirs in several parts of Europe were at a very low levels, insufficient to sustain demand, according to Copernicus. Southern England experienced its driest July since records began in 1836, while the month across the United Kingdom was the driest July in more than 20 years. The UK saw just 46.3mm, or 56%, of its average rainfall for the month following a long run of drier-than-average months, with the exception of February. In France, July saw a total rainfall of 9.7mm, which made it the driest July there since records began in 1959 and represented a rainfall deficit of 85% compared to the 1991-2020 average. Meanwhile, in Italy, a lack of rain since December 2021 has hit northern parts of the country and the Po River completely dried up in places earlier this summer. In mid-July at Cremona – around halfway along the Po – the water was more than 8 meters below “hydrographic zero,” impacting hydroenergy production, agriculture and transport.  Copernicus said the situation improved as a result of rainfall towards the end of the month, which brought a 40cm increase for the river, although hydropower production in the region was still affected. July was also globally one of three warmest recorded, close to 0.4 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and the sixth-hottest July in Europe, Copernicus said.  Spain, France and the United Kingdom experienced at least one day over 40 degrees Celsius last month. In the UK, temperatures climbed to over over 40 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) on July 19 with the English village of Coningsby recording 40.3C for the first time ever.  Meanwhile, Spain reported its hottest July in over 60 years on Monday.  “July 2022 has been extremely hot in Spain, the warmest since at least 1961, with an average temperature of 25.6 ºC [78.1 Fahrenheit], which is 2.7 ºC [4.9 Fahrenheit] higher than the normal average,” the country’s national weather agency AEMET said in a post on Twitter. July was “0.2 ºC [0.4 Fahrenheit] higher than that of July 2015, which until now was the warmest month of July,” it added.

342,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/senate-vote-burn-pits/,"The Senate voted Tuesday night to pass a long-sought bipartisan legislation to expand health care benefits for millions of veterans exposed to toxic burn pits during their military service, sending the bill to President Joe Biden to sign into law. The final vote was 86-11.  Passage of the bill marks the end of a lengthy fight to get the legislation through Congress, as veterans and their advocates had been demonstrating on Capitol Hill for days. Many veterans were allowed into the Senate gallery to watch the final vote on Tuesday evening. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced after reaching the deal with Republicans who had blocked the bill from advancing last week while they sought to add cost-controlling amendment votes to the package.  “I have some good news, the minority leader and I have come to an agreement to vote on the PACT Act this evening,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “I’m very optimistic that this bill will pass so our veterans across America can breathe a sigh of relief.” The bill, called the Honoring our PACT Act, was approved by the House of Representatives in July. The bill widely expands health care resources and benefits to those exposed to burn pits and could provide coverage for up to 3.5 million toxic-exposed veterans. It adds conditions related to burn pit and toxic exposure, including hypertension, to the Department of Veterans Affair’s list of illnesses that have been incurred or exacerbated during military service. The legislation had been held up in the chamber since last week when more than two dozen Republicans, who previously supported the measure, temporarily blocked it from advancing. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, rallied fellow Republicans to hold up the legislation in exchange for amendment votes, specifically an amendment that would change an accounting provision. Toomey had previously said he wanted an amendment vote with a 50-vote threshold.   Tuesday’s final vote followed votes on three amendments with a 60-vote threshold. Toomey’s amendment, which would have made a change to a budget component of the legislation, failed as expected, in a vote of 47-48. Last week’s surprise move by Republicans led to a swift backlash among veterans and veterans’ groups, including protests on the US Capitol steps over the weekend and early this week. Comedian and political activist Jon Stewart – a lead advocate for veterans on the issue – took individual GOP senators to task for holding up a bill that had garnered wide bipartisan support in earlier votes. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell defended his party’s handling of the legislation at a news conference on Tuesday.  “Look, these kind of back and forths happen all the time in the legislative process, you’ve observed that over the years,” he said. “I think in the end, the veterans service organizations will be pleased with the final result.” This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

142,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/middleeast/iraq-protests-parliament-deadlock-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here. Iraq is in the midst of its worst and longest political crisis in years. At the center of this overheating conflict stands Iraqi political kingmaker Moqtada al-Sadr and a rival bloc of parties with strong ties to neighboring Iran.   In a show of strength, supporters of Shiite cleric Sadr last week twice stormed Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone – which houses government buildings and Western embassies – and on Sunday staged  a long sit-in inside parliament.   While Sadr’s supporters are rallying against the nomination of a new prime minister, these protests also represent a deep political rift festering between Iraq’s rival Shiite blocs and the influential hand that analysts say Iran is playing from afar.   “Iran will be a party in this conflict,” said Ihsan Al-Shammari, a politics professor at Baghdad University and head of the Iraqi Centre for Political Thought.  “And Sadr is aware that Iran could be what pushes the Coordination Framework to try to inflate its influence in the political scene in Iraq,” he added.   A Shiite bloc that is aligned with Iran and opposed to Sadr, the Coordination Framework includes politicians with ties to Tehran, including former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki.  It also includes paramilitary groups that are heavily armed by Iran.  The latest turmoil follows nine months of political deadlock, bickering and accusations that have hindered the formation of a government after Sadr emerged as the biggest winner in October’s parliamentary election.   Sadr’s win threatened to sideline the Iran-aligned Shiite blocs that have dominated Iraqi politics for decades.  In what was described as a ‘tectonic shift’ in Iraqi politics, Sadr in June asked his political bloc to resign from parliament after failing to cooperate with opposing blocs. The move showed Sadr’s true power: his ability to mobilize supporters on the streets in large numbers and with great force.   In a potentially escalatory move, the Coordination Framework on Sunday called for protesters to also take to the streets on Monday.  “Iraq’s political system is on the brink of irreparable collapse and the country is headed toward a civil war between Sadr and his Iran-aligned rivals,” said Ranj Alaaldin, nonresident fellow in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC.  Speaking at a weekly press conference, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said that the situation in Iraq was caused by internal political disputes, reported the state news agency IRNA on Monday. Kanaani’s comments seemed to dismiss the speculation around Tehran’s role in Baghdad’s current crisis.   While some experts say that the current political stalemate is deeply entrenched in the level of influence Iran has over its neighbor, others do not believe Iran drives the conflict.  “I think the motives for this conflict are primarily internal and not the divisions about Iran,” said Mohammed Shummary, chairman of Sumeria Foundation in Baghdad.   “There are transformations taking place within Iraqi politics and rising ambitions from different parties who wish to consolidate power,” Shummary said, adding that accusations of links with Iran have become a tool – primarily used by non-Iran-aligned blocs – to discredit their rivals.   While Sadr has for years positioned himself against both Iran and the United States, the popular cleric has not always held a consistent position toward Tehran.   Once a fugitive from US forces that sought to arrest him in Iraq, Sadr was believed to have been hiding in Iran from 2007. He returned to Iraq in 2011 after striking a deal with the Iraqi government in power at the time.   When protesters first stormed parliament on Wednesday, they were denouncing the nomination of Mohammed Shiya al-Sudani for prime minister – a figure put forth by the Coordination Framework and who many see as an ally of Iran-aligned Maliki.   But the real problems go far beyond al-Sudani’s nomination, says Al-Shammari, who added that discontent is primarily centered around what is perceived as Iran-aligned Shiite blocs’ attempts to isolate Sadr and exclude him from politics.   In a statement on Twitter, Sadr called on politicians to listen to protesters’ demands, saying there is now a “golden opportunity to end corruption and injustice.”   Sadr warned if the protesters’ demands are not met, then he is not to blame for the chaos that follows.   “The current revolution is Sadrist,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you miss this opportunity, do not blame me.”   Despite efforts to cool off the tensions, Alaaldin believes that it will be difficult to see Sadr retreating “unless he is given the government he initially wanted.”   “This remains the longest political deadlock [in Iraq] since 2003,” said Al-Shammari, adding that even if it is resolved, it is unlikely to be the last crisis to face the oil-rich country.   “The political system faces great paralysis,” he said, warning that “reaching a moment of collision would indicate that this rift has reached unprecedented levels.”    The digest  First ship carrying Ukrainian corn  heading for Lebanon   The first grain ship departing the Black Sea port of Odesa since the early days of the Ukraine war will carry Ukrainian corn to Lebanon, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday.

Iran responds to EU proposal to salvage nuclear deal   Iran’s deputy foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani said Sunday that Tehran had responded to an EU proposal to revitalize the 2015 nuclear deal amid reports of Iran’s speedy progress in its nuclear program.    CNN investigates  Thousands of protesters rallied in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Sunday calling for an end to military rule, following a CNN investigation that exposed Russia’s plundering of gold in the African nation.  Clashes erupted after hundreds of demonstrators attempted to head to the Republican Palace – Sudan’s presidential offices – but were met by police, who responded by firing tear gas at the protesters.  The protests come after a CNN investigation, based on multiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN, painted a picture of an elaborate years-long Russian scheme to extract Sudan’s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against increasingly robust Western sanctions and buttress Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.  The evidence uncovered by CNN also suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan’s military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and depriving the poverty-stricken nation of hundreds of millions in state revenue.  The investigation was shared widely in Sudan and caused public outcry. Hours after the report was broadcast, posts began circulating on WhatsApp and other social media platforms used by pro-democracy activists.   By Nima Elbagir, CNN   What’s trending   Lebanon: #Beirut_Port   Four days before the second anniversary of the deadly Beirut blast on August 4, the city’s port was trending on Lebanese social media for a different reason.   Two wheat silos in the port collapsed on Sunday. The structures, which withstood the effects of the huge explosion in 2020, have been smoldering and burning for weeks, filling parts of Lebanon’s capital with the smell of smoke.  The flames were caused by rising temperatures in the country.  According to state media, the part that collapsed was the most fragile since the blast and was expected to fall.  This was confirmed by Ali Hamye, Lebanon’s minister of Public Works and Transport, who told Al Jadeed TV that the two silos collapsed, and other silos are also expected to fall apart.  The 2020 explosion took the lives of more than 200 people and injured over 6,500 others. The shockwaves tore through the city, flipping cars, shattering glass and causing some homes to crumble.  The explosion was caused by 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive material, stored in the port without preventative measures, according to then Prime Minister Hassan Diab.   Lebanon’s economic woes have been no stranger to headlines, but its rate of decline has been exponential in the last two years. Its inflation rate stood at 210% in June, with currency rates changing drastically by the day.

141,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/middleeast/iraq-protests-parliament-deadlock-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here. Iraq is in the midst of its worst and longest political crisis in years. At the center of this overheating conflict stands Iraqi political kingmaker Moqtada al-Sadr and a rival bloc of parties with strong ties to neighboring Iran.   In a show of strength, supporters of Shiite cleric Sadr last week twice stormed Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone – which houses government buildings and Western embassies – and on Sunday staged  a long sit-in inside parliament.   While Sadr’s supporters are rallying against the nomination of a new prime minister, these protests also represent a deep political rift festering between Iraq’s rival Shiite blocs and the influential hand that analysts say Iran is playing from afar.   “Iran will be a party in this conflict,” said Ihsan Al-Shammari, a politics professor at Baghdad University and head of the Iraqi Centre for Political Thought.  “And Sadr is aware that Iran could be what pushes the Coordination Framework to try to inflate its influence in the political scene in Iraq,” he added.   A Shiite bloc that is aligned with Iran and opposed to Sadr, the Coordination Framework includes politicians with ties to Tehran, including former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki.  It also includes paramilitary groups that are heavily armed by Iran.  The latest turmoil follows nine months of political deadlock, bickering and accusations that have hindered the formation of a government after Sadr emerged as the biggest winner in October’s parliamentary election.   Sadr’s win threatened to sideline the Iran-aligned Shiite blocs that have dominated Iraqi politics for decades.  In what was described as a ‘tectonic shift’ in Iraqi politics, Sadr in June asked his political bloc to resign from parliament after failing to cooperate with opposing blocs. The move showed Sadr’s true power: his ability to mobilize supporters on the streets in large numbers and with great force.   In a potentially escalatory move, the Coordination Framework on Sunday called for protesters to also take to the streets on Monday.  “Iraq’s political system is on the brink of irreparable collapse and the country is headed toward a civil war between Sadr and his Iran-aligned rivals,” said Ranj Alaaldin, nonresident fellow in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, DC.  Speaking at a weekly press conference, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said that the situation in Iraq was caused by internal political disputes, reported the state news agency IRNA on Monday. Kanaani’s comments seemed to dismiss the speculation around Tehran’s role in Baghdad’s current crisis.   While some experts say that the current political stalemate is deeply entrenched in the level of influence Iran has over its neighbor, others do not believe Iran drives the conflict.  “I think the motives for this conflict are primarily internal and not the divisions about Iran,” said Mohammed Shummary, chairman of Sumeria Foundation in Baghdad.   “There are transformations taking place within Iraqi politics and rising ambitions from different parties who wish to consolidate power,” Shummary said, adding that accusations of links with Iran have become a tool – primarily used by non-Iran-aligned blocs – to discredit their rivals.   While Sadr has for years positioned himself against both Iran and the United States, the popular cleric has not always held a consistent position toward Tehran.   Once a fugitive from US forces that sought to arrest him in Iraq, Sadr was believed to have been hiding in Iran from 2007. He returned to Iraq in 2011 after striking a deal with the Iraqi government in power at the time.   When protesters first stormed parliament on Wednesday, they were denouncing the nomination of Mohammed Shiya al-Sudani for prime minister – a figure put forth by the Coordination Framework and who many see as an ally of Iran-aligned Maliki.   But the real problems go far beyond al-Sudani’s nomination, says Al-Shammari, who added that discontent is primarily centered around what is perceived as Iran-aligned Shiite blocs’ attempts to isolate Sadr and exclude him from politics.   In a statement on Twitter, Sadr called on politicians to listen to protesters’ demands, saying there is now a “golden opportunity to end corruption and injustice.”   Sadr warned if the protesters’ demands are not met, then he is not to blame for the chaos that follows.   “The current revolution is Sadrist,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you miss this opportunity, do not blame me.”   Despite efforts to cool off the tensions, Alaaldin believes that it will be difficult to see Sadr retreating “unless he is given the government he initially wanted.”   “This remains the longest political deadlock [in Iraq] since 2003,” said Al-Shammari, adding that even if it is resolved, it is unlikely to be the last crisis to face the oil-rich country.   “The political system faces great paralysis,” he said, warning that “reaching a moment of collision would indicate that this rift has reached unprecedented levels.”    The digest  First ship carrying Ukrainian corn  heading for Lebanon   The first grain ship departing the Black Sea port of Odesa since the early days of the Ukraine war will carry Ukrainian corn to Lebanon, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday.  Death toll from Iran floods climbs  At least 69 people were killed after flooding and landslides damaged cities across Iran, the Iranian Red Crescent said in a tweet on Friday.    Iran responds to EU proposal to salvage nuclear deal   Iran’s deputy foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani said Sunday that Tehran had responded to an EU proposal to revitalize the 2015 nuclear deal amid reports of Iran’s speedy progress in its nuclear program.    CNN investigates  Thousands of protesters rallied in the Sudanese capital Khartoum on Sunday calling for an end to military rule, following a CNN investigation that exposed Russia’s plundering of gold in the African nation.  Clashes erupted after hundreds of demonstrators attempted to head to the Republican Palace – Sudan’s presidential offices – but were met by police, who responded by firing tear gas at the protesters.  The protests come after a CNN investigation, based on multiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN, painted a picture of an elaborate years-long Russian scheme to extract Sudan’s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against increasingly robust Western sanctions and buttress Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.  The evidence uncovered by CNN also suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan’s military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and depriving the poverty-stricken nation of hundreds of millions in state revenue.  The investigation was shared widely in Sudan and caused public outcry. Hours after the report was broadcast, posts began circulating on WhatsApp and other social media platforms used by pro-democracy activists.   By Nima Elbagir, CNN   What’s trending   Lebanon: #Beirut_Port   Four days before the second anniversary of the deadly Beirut blast on August 4, the city’s port was trending on Lebanese social media for a different reason.   Two wheat silos in the port collapsed on Sunday. The structures, which withstood the effects of the huge explosion in 2020, have been smoldering and burning for weeks, filling parts of Lebanon’s capital with the smell of smoke.  The flames were caused by rising temperatures in the country.  According to state media, the part that collapsed was the most fragile since the blast and was expected to fall.  This was confirmed by Ali Hamye, Lebanon’s minister of Public Works and Transport, who told Al Jadeed TV that the two silos collapsed, and other silos are also expected to fall apart.  The 2020 explosion took the lives of more than 200 people and injured over 6,500 others. The shockwaves tore through the city, flipping cars, shattering glass and causing some homes to crumble.  The explosion was caused by 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive material, stored in the port without preventative measures, according to then Prime Minister Hassan Diab.   Lebanon’s economic woes have been no stranger to headlines, but its rate of decline has been exponential in the last two years. Its inflation rate stood at 210% in June, with currency rates changing drastically by the day.

390,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/insulin-cap-democrats-reconciliation-bill/,"Senate Democrats failed to realize their longstanding goal of lowering the price of insulin for the more than 150 million Americans with private health insurance. The party had pushed to include a measure in their climate and health care package that passed the chamber Sunday that would place a $35 cap on insulin for those on Medicare and with private coverage.   However, the Senate parliamentarian decided that extending the cap to the private market was not compliant with the rules of the reconciliation process, which Democrats used to pass the legislation with a simple majority vote. Democrats kept the provision in the bill anyway, but Republicans on Sunday raised a point of order that led to a vote that limited the $35 cap to Medicare beneficiaries only. The final vote was 57-43, with seven GOP senators joining all members of the Senate Democratic Caucus on the vote – but a 60-vote threshold was needed to keep the private market provision in place.   The seven GOP senators who supported the provision were Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy, both of Louisiana, and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both of Alaska. Longstanding mission Democrats have long sought to reduce the price of insulin, which has skyrocketed over the years though it only costs a few dollars to make. That has forced some Americans to ration the medication, sometimes with fatal consequences. President Joe Biden called for the $35 cap in his State of the Union address in March, and Democrats included it in their sweeping Build Back Better package, which passed the House last fall before stalling in the Senate. This year, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia pushed a bill that would limit the cost of insulin to $35, as did Collins and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire in a bipartisan effort. Neither has advanced.  More than 37 million people in the US have diabetes – more than 1 in 10 Americans – though not all are aware of it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 7 million people rely on insulin. About a fifth of those who take insulin and have health coverage through large employers pay more than $35 a month for the medication, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than a quarter of people with Affordable Care Act policies and nearly one-third of those insured through a small employer pay more than that threshold.",Susan Collins;Jeanne Shaheen;Bill Cassidy;Joe Biden;Josh Hawley;John Kennedy;Dan Sullivan;Raphael Warnock;Lisa Murkowski,Centers For Disease;Senate Democrats;Kaiser Family Foundation;Senate Democratic Caucus,"TAX_FNCACT_SENATORS,802;TAX_FNCACT_SENATORS,975;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,648;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,2056;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2056;WB_625_HEALTH_ECONOMICS_AND_FINANCE,152;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,152;WB_1287_HEALTH_INSURANCE,152;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,152;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYER,2421;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,498;WB_2482_RECONCILIATION,498;WB_2519_RESPONSES_TO_HUMAN_RIGHTS_ABUSES,498;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,498;TAX_ECON_PRICE,81;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1264;WB_1973_FINANCIAL_RISK_REDUCTION,152;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,152;WB_337_INSURANCE,152;WB_1967_AGRICULTURAL_RISK_AND_SECURITY,152;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYERS,2205;WB_2690_CATEGORIES_OF_EMPLOYMENT,2205;WB_2670_JOBS,2205;WB_2689_JOBS_DIAGNOSTICS,2205;WB_2704_EMPLOYER,2205;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,122;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1386;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1978;EPU_CATS_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAMS,326;EPU_CATS_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAMS,737;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2077;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2077;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2077;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2077;WB_2026_PREVENTION,2077;TAX_DISEASE_DIABETES,1950;TAX_CHRONICDISEASE_DIABETES,1950;WB_1406_DISEASES,1950;WB_1433_DIABETES,1950;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,1950;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,17;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,524;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,594;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1227;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1549;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,17;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,524;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,594;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1227;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1549;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,214;GENERAL_HEALTH,142;GENERAL_HEALTH,223;GENERAL_HEALTH,2172;MEDICAL,142;MEDICAL,223;MEDICAL,2172;LEGISLATION,553;USPEC_POLICY1,553;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,553;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLARS,1346;TAX_SPECIAL_ISSUES_AFFORDABLE_CARE_ACT,2358;LEADER,1460;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1460;WB_1292_PRIVATE_HEALTH_INSURANCE,152;DELAY,1656;",Mississippi;Maine;Americans;Alaska;Georgia;Louisiana;New Hampshire;Missouri
320,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/hawaii-couple-charged-identity-theft/,"A married couple in Hawaii has been indicted for allegedly living under the identities of dead children from Texas for decades and conspiring against the government, according to unsealed federal court records.   A federal grand jury in Honolulu indicted Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison on conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, and false statements in the application and use of a passport.  Morrison and Primrose pleaded not guilty during a teleconferenced hearing Tuesday in the US District Court in Hawaii.  An affidavit alleges that in 1987, Primrose and Morrison obtained Texas birth certificate records for deceased American-born infants that “they used to unlawfully assume the identities of ‘Bobby Edward Fort’ and ‘Julie Lyn Montague.’” Primrose and Morrison are said to “have agreed to assume the identities of deceased American-born infants and have been fully living in these fraudulently assumed identities since 1987,” according to an affidavit in the complaint. The actual Fort was born in 1967 and died the same year from asphyxia and was buried in Texas, the affidavit states. The real Montague was born and died in 1968 and was buried in Texas about 14 miles from where Fort was buried. Federal prosecutors also say they have pictures of Primrose and Morrison in a KGB jacket which prosecutors entered into court as part of a motion to deny the couple bail. CNN has reached out to the attorneys for the couple for a statement but has not yet heard back.  Morrison’s attorney Megan Kau told CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now (HNN) that Morrison is “shocked” by the accusations. “She has nothing to do with Russia,” Kau said.  Kau said the KGB jacket didn’t belong to Primrose or Morrison. “She tried on a uniform that was at a friend’s house one time and they took pictures,” Kau told HNN. “She was born and raised in the United States and she wants the world to know that she is not a spy.” A close friend of Morrison told federal agents that Morrison lived in Romania years ago “while that country was within the Communist bloc.” No record of a passport in Morrison’s name was found by the Department of State that would allow her to travel internationally, the motion states. Meanwhile, a motion to detain Primrose without bond was granted on July 28, a court docket shows. During Tuesday’s hearing, the court also granted a motion made by the government calling for Morrison to be detained without bail.  “Based upon the instant record, the Court does not reach any conclusions concerning whether and to what extent Defendant may pose a significant risk of danger to the community, if released,” according to court records.  Prosecutors filed the motion to detain the defendants alleging Primrose and Morrison are a serious flight risk and that Primrose has had secret clearance as a defense contractor with the US Coast Guard (USCG) Air Station at Barbers Point on Oahu for six years.  The motion also claims Primrose had secret clearance as an avionics electrical technician in the USCG before that and was required to report any foreign travel, but an investigation revealed he failed to report several trips to Canada even though he reported other foreign travel. The motion added that through his work in the USCG, he has “become highly skilled in electronics and would be able to communicate surreptitiously with others if released from pretrial confinement.” Primrose is currently in the custody of the US Marshals Service at the Federal Detention Center in Honolulu, according to minutes from his detention hearing. A telephonic preliminary hearing is also set for August 8. Dennis K. Thomas, Special Agent for the US Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) alleges in the complaint/affidavit that Primrose and Morrison “unlawfully assumed the identities of deceased United States citizens” to apply for US passports, social security cards, and Department of Defense identity document cards. Primrose’s attorney Max Mizono said in an email to CNN, “I have no comments or statements about his case.” A trial and jury selection is expected to begin on September 26 before District Judge Leslie E. Kobayashi.

19,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/biden-agenda-energy-health-care-bill/,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. It’s a make-or-break week for President Joe Biden’s agenda.  The deal on energy and health care that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin announced last week has a narrow window to navigate both chambers of Congress and land on the President’s desk before August recess.  And with the shock of the deal’s announcement wearing off, GOP opposition, public scrutiny, and Democrats’ slim majorities will all have a say in whether the legislation is a breakthrough or a bust.  Here’s what you need to know.  What’s in the bill?  The agreement contains a number of Democrats’ goals, including some provisions that party leaders have worked toward for years: What’s not in the bill? To be clear, this isn’t Build Back Better 2.0. The package is less than half the size of Biden’s original social safety net plan, and a number of key Democratic priorities are likely to be left out, including: What are Republicans saying? The package, as it stands, is facing furious GOP opposition. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee released data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that showed that Americans of all incomes would see their federal taxes rise under the climate and health care package. That analysis, however, looked at the indirect effect of the 15% minimum tax provision on corporations. Economists assume companies would then pass along part of their tax increase to employees by reducing their after-tax wages and job opportunities. Also, shareholders would take a hit since the value of their stock holdings, including those held in pensions and mutual funds, would likely decline. What’s Biden saying? The President has urged congressional Democrats to quickly pass the surprise agreement “for America.” “This bill is far from perfect. It’s a compromise. But it’s often how progress is made, by compromises. The fact is that my message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass to lower inflation, cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle the climate crises and promote energy security – all the time while reducing the burdens facing working-class and middle-class families,” Biden said during a speech at the White House the day after the deal was announced. What’s the timeline? The health and climate bill stands a serious chance of becoming law as soon as August, assuming it passes muster with the Senate parliamentarian to allow it to be approved along straight party lines in the budget process – and all Democrats vote for it (more on that below) – and that the House passes it. Democrats need all 50 of their senators to be present and vote in favor of the bill with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote, as all Republicans are expected to vote against the deal. Manchin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday he hopes the legislation passes before the August recess. “I think it’s a great piece of legislation and on normal times, my Republican colleagues would be for something such as this. We’ve basically paid down debt, (which) is what they want. We’ve accelerated permitting, which is what they want. And we’ve increased production of energy, which is what they want. We’ve done things that we should be doing together,” Manchin said.  Will Democrats be united? All eyes in Washington are on Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a key moderate, who has not yet weighed in on the bill. She has previously raised concerns about taxes on carried interest, which would raise $14 billion under the deal. Sinema was not part of negotiations for the current package. Asked about getting the support of his Arizona colleague, Manchin said on Sunday, “We work very close together on so many things, and she has so much in this piece of legislation. She’s formed quite a bit of and worked on it very hard.” “I think that basically when she looks at the bill and sees the whole spectrum of what we’re doing … hopefully she will be positive about it, but she’ll make her decision and I respect that,” he added.  How did this come together? Read this report from CNN’s Capitol Hill team. The climate and tax deal came together in almost complete secret, catching many by surprise when it was announced. Schumer and Manchin have been in revived talks since July 18 and locked down a deal last Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. Manchin had thrown cold water on doing tax and energy provisions as part of the deal, but ultimately agreed to it.

172,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/tulsa-1921-race-massacre-lawsuit/,"A Tulsa judge is allowing a lawsuit brought by plaintiffs including three living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre to officially move forward. The written order, filed on Wednesday, provides the reasoning behind a May decision by Tulsa County District Judge Caroline Wall that denied in part and granted in part a motion to dismiss the case brought forward by defendants, including the city of Tulsa and Tulsa County. No further details were offered at the time. The three living survivors are Viola Fletcher, Lessie Benningfield Randle and Hughes Van Ellis Sr. They’re all more than 100 years old, and were children when a White mob, over the course of approximately 24 hours on May 31 and June 1, 1921, destroyed the prosperous Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was beloved as Black Wall Street. Some 300 people were killed, while thousands more were left homeless, according to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum. In May, Ed Mitzen, the co-founder of the New York-based nonprofit Business for Good, presented a $1 million donation to Fletcher, Randle and Van Ellis as a way to start reckoning with the wrongs they’ve had to endure. Members of the survivors’ legal team celebrated the order as a means toward justice. “This order is something we’ve been waiting on since our historic hearing back on May 2, 2022,” Damario Solomon-Simmons, attorney for the survivors, said during a news conference on Thursday. “This order gives us the framework for how we get to move forward.” “Although we didn’t get everything we wanted,” Solomon-Simmons continued, “these three survivors have the ability to move forward with our case. For the first time in over 100 years, we have an opportunity to prove that the massacre created a public nuisance here in Tulsa, and that public nuisance needs to be abated. This is a historic win for our community. This is a historic win for our survivors. And it’s a historic win for racial justice advocates throughout this country.” Michael Swartz, another attorney for the survivors, echoed some of Solomon-Simmons’ sentiments. “This is a landmark ruling,” Swartz said Thursday. “It allows us not only to file the papers in court but to take the next step that nobody’s achieved before, with taking discovery – taking documents, taking depositions – and getting to the root of what actually happened in the massacre.” What the court said The plaintiffs brought claims for public nuisance and unjust enrichment. Regarding the public nuisance claim, the court allowed the claim brought by the three survivors to proceed but dismissed the claim from the other plaintiffs. The court found that the survivors established standing to sue, noting that “a private person may maintain an action for a public nuisance if it is especially injurious to himself, but not otherwise.” “The court finds Plaintiffs Randle, Fletcher and Van Ellis Sr. meet this statutory criteria,” Wall wrote. Wall cites a separate case when writing, “A pleading must not be dismissed for failure to state a legally cognizable claim unless the allegations indicate beyond any doubt that the litigant can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief.” She then adds, “The court cannot find beyond any doubt that Plaintiffs Randle, Fletcher, and Van Ellis Sr. can prove no set of facts which would entitle Plaintiffs to relief on their public nuisance claims.” The plaintiffs had argued that the damage inflicted during the massacre was a “public nuisance” from the start and “one of the worst acts of domestic terrorism in United States history since slavery.” Generally, a public nuisance is when a person or entity “unreasonably interferes with a right that the general public shares in common,” according to the Legal Information Institute. “We look forward to proving our case around the Massacre’s ongoing catastrophic effects and demonstrating the actions that defendants must take to repair and rebuild the Greenwood community during our clients’ lifetimes,” said Solomon-Simmons as part of a released statement. While part of the claim for a public nuisance was allowed to proceed, claims for an “ongoing” public nuisance were “dismissed with prejudice because these claims request relief that violates the separation of powers provided by the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma.” “Therefore, the court dismisses with prejudice the public nuisance claims described in Plaintiff’s Amended Petition seeking relief for all alleged unreasonable, unwarranted, and unlawful acts or omissions of defendants in the decades subsequent to the 1921 Race Massacre, including but not limited to policing, urban planning, and public schools,” Wall wrote. Part of the rejected plaintiffs’ argument was that the damage in 1921 led to ongoing damages and disparities that still play out today in Tulsa. But Wall cited a recent historic Oklahoma Supreme Court Johnson & Johnson public nuisance decision that said in part, “The Court has allowed public nuisance claims to address discrete, localized problems, not policy problems.” The court dismissed the claim for unjust enrichment but is giving the three remaining plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended petition. The court also granted leave for the plaintiffs to amend their petition to attempt to replead an abatement remedy. While testifying before members of a House Judiciary subcommittee in May 2021, Randle, one of the survivors, snapped into focus the profound devastation of the massacre. “They owe us something. They owe me something. I have lived much of my life poor. My opportunities were taken from me and my community. North Tulsa, Black Tulsa, is still messed up today. They didn’t rebuild it. It’s empty. It’s a ghetto,” she said. The plaintiffs have until September 2 to file an amended petition.",Viola Fletcher;Hughes Van Ellis;Lessie Benningfield Randle,Legal Information Institute;Oklahoma Supreme Court Johnson Johnson;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"WB_2467_TERRORISM,1877;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1877;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1877;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,1877;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1877;TRIAL,51;WB_813_URBAN_GOVERNANCE_AND_CITY_SYSTEMS,3014;WB_699_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT,3014;WB_1720_CITY_STRATEGIES_AND_TERRITORIAL_PLANNING,3014;WB_816_STRATEGIC_URBAN_PLANNING,3014;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,29;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,312;EDUCATION,3033;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,3033;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,3743;USPEC_POLICY1,3418;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3418;AFFECT,105;AFFECT,755;AFFECT,845;AFFECT,1201;AFFECT,2372;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,105;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,755;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,845;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1201;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,2372;SOC_SLAVERY,1916;WB_2507_HUMAN_RIGHTS_ABUSES_AND_VIOLATIONS,1916;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1916;WB_2511_SLAVERY,1916;URBAN,3005;KILL,149;KILL,1243;KILL,1796;KILL,2158;KILL,2959;TERROR,149;TERROR,1243;TERROR,1796;TERROR,2158;TERROR,2959;ARMEDCONFLICT,149;ARMEDCONFLICT,1243;ARMEDCONFLICT,1796;ARMEDCONFLICT,2158;ARMEDCONFLICT,2959;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2354;PROTEST,2203;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2548;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2741;CONSTITUTIONAL,2652;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1761;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3109;",City Of Tulsa;State Of Oklahoma;Oklahoma;United States;Tulsa
559,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/infant-safe-haven-law-abortion-invs/,"As many American women reckon with the sudden loss of their constitutional right to abortion, conservatives have floated an alternative they say makes abortion less necessary: safe haven laws.  The laws, which allow mothers to anonymously abandon infants at hospitals and other designated sites shortly after giving birth, have been in place in all 50 states since 2008. Two conservative Supreme Court justices nodded to safe haven laws during the case that overturned Roe v. Wade. Justice Samuel Alito noted in the majority opinion that Americans who want to restrict abortion point to the laws as an option for women. During oral arguments, Justice Amy Coney Barrett conceded that pregnancy is an infringement on bodily autonomy but distinguished that from concerns over forced parenthood and echoed a sentiment anti-abortion activists have been pushing for decades, asking: “Why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?”   But American women — even in states where in recent years they have had little access to abortion — rarely use safe havens as an option. A CNN review of the laws found that there have been at least 3,251 babies surrendered since 1999. Some states go years without a woman using the option. CNN reached out to social services agencies in all 50 states — 40 states provided figures while seven states told CNN they do not process data on safe haven use, partially because incidents are so rare. Three didn’t provide data. When women don’t have an abortion but opt not to raise the child, they more frequently turn to traditional adoption, which gives biological parents control over the placement of an infant and can allow for a longterm connection with the child through open adoption. Even so, the numbers in the United States are relatively low — in 2020, there were roughly 95,000 children who were adopted. This figure includes children who are adopted by family members and stepparents. Meanwhile, nearly a million American women received abortions in 2020. Northwestern University professor Katie Watson, who teaches law, ethics, and humanities to medical students, said the conservative argument that safe havens are an alternative to abortion is disingenuous. “When a person has an abortion, they are saying, ‘I do not want to have a baby.’ And adoption (or using a safe haven) does mean they don’t have to parent the child, but they still had a baby, which was the thing that most people having an abortion did not want to do,” Watson said.  Safe havens aren’t new  Safe havens were never intended to serve as an alternative to abortion. They were developed to offer an alternative to infanticide, Watson said. Texas passed the nation’s first safe haven law in 1999 after a spike of deserted babies in the Houston area. It allowed a mother or father to surrender their baby at any hospital, fire station or emergency medical services station in Texas. The only condition was that the baby not be more than 30 days old. Today, the law allows up to 60 days.  By 2008, all 50 states had adopted their own safe haven laws. The pace at which the relatively obscure concept gained steam in state legislatures was due to widespread public support on the issue, said Dr. Suzanne B. Haney, who chairs the Council on Child Abuse and Prevention at the American Academy of Pediatrics.  “We’re talking about babies being left in dumpsters. I mean, that’s a really easy bandwagon to get onto,” she said. Carol Sanger, a law professor at Columbia University, agreed with Haney but indicated that some abortion rights activists and legislators worried the laws were a distraction from the larger reproductive rights conversation, but felt they had little choice but to be on board. “If you don’t agree with safe havens, it’s like you can be accused of encouraging infanticide,” Sanger said.   The laws vary by state. In North Dakota, for example, babies under a year old can be abandoned at a designated safe haven site, which includes police stations, hospitals and even county social services offices. In Alabama, parents only have three days and the baby must be taken to a hospital. There’s been a recent push to expand safe haven laws. In March, Virginia lawmakers passed four bills to expand the state’s laws. In early June, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves penned a column for a Christian news website, titled “The New Pro-Life Agenda,” where he promised to “extend safe haven laws.” Last year, legislation expanding safe haven protections passed in Indiana and Pennsylvania.  Perhaps safe havens are doing their job: Incidents of infant homicides have become less frequent. According to a 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that looked at infant homicides and safe haven laws, the overall US infant homicide rate fell by 66.7% from 2008 to 2017 — after all 50 states had safe haven laws on the books. Babies are still 5.4 times more likely to be killed on the day they are born than at any other point in life.  But Watson, the Northwestern professor, said the existence of safe haven laws may not be the only reason why fewer infants are dying by homicide. “Our recognition and treatment of prenatal and perinatal depression — maternal depression — is so much better,” Watson said. “The awareness that pregnancy can mess with your head and your mental health sometimes may contribute to that lower rate of infanticide.” The anti-abortion movement’s ‘prominent’ connection to safe haven laws In the early 1970s, decades before safe haven laws were implemented, Monica Kelsey was abandoned by her biological mother at a hospital on the day she was born. Kelsey, who was adopted by an Ohio family, in 2016 founded Safe Haven Baby Boxes, a nonprofit that has installed more than 100 electronically monitored baby boxes at fire stations and hospitals across seven states. The boxes allow individuals to anonymously deposit unwanted infants. On her personal website, Kelsey advertises herself as “a pro-life advocate and speaker” but, in an interview, she emphasized that her organization depended on workers and volunteers from both sides of the debate. She noted that baby boxes are aimed at helping women who’ve already given birth.  “These babies — they’re (already) born,” Kelsey said. “This isn’t a pro-life or pro-choice issue that we’re working with.” Kelsey’s position — having one foot in the anti-abortion fight and another in the safe haven movement — isn’t unique. The efforts have long been intertwined. They share much of the same religious rhetoric and influence. The first safe haven law in Texas was called the ‘Baby Moses’ Law, named for the Biblical story of Moses’ rescue. In Missouri, parents can drop a child at a crisis pregnancy center, which are often faith-based organizations that aim to dissuade women from getting an abortion and are exempt from regulatory oversight that govern health care facilities, in addition to a hospital or a fire station. In some states, such as Arizona and New Hampshire, a parent can surrender a baby at a church, despite the fact that they lack medical resources. Religious groups such as the Catholic Church promote safe haven laws on their websites. “Choose Life” license plates in states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Washington, DC, help finance safe havens.   To those paying attention, Coney Barrett’s line of questioning on safe haven laws during the oral arguments in the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case may have sounded familiar. She pushed the lawyer representing Jackson Women’s Health to separate parenthood from pregnancy — a common narrative from anti-abortion groups, according to Watson — and framed the choice as one between undergoing an abortion at fetal viability, or 23 weeks, or waiting to “terminate parental rights at the conclusion.”  The language was remarkably similar to an amicus brief filed more than a year earlier by The Justice Foundation, an influential conservative legal non-profit, on behalf of 336,214 signers of a “Moral Outcry” petition. The Texas-based foundation argued that safe haven laws eliminate any legal need for abortion, in one instance contending that, under the 15-week Mississippi law, a woman could “simply wait a relatively short while later and place the child with the state after birth at no cost whatsoever.” The brief’s conclusion was even more explicit: “The Safe Haven laws give women total freedom from burdens of unwanted children.”  But experts say Coney Barrett’s comments from the bench ignore the dangers of childbirth — American women are 14 times more likely to die from childbirth than they are from a legal abortion, according to a 2012 study — and the months-long physical and financial demands of pregnancy. Lawyer Julie Rikelman, who represented the Mississippi clinic in the Supreme Court Case, highlighted these issues in her response to Coney Barrett. “Pregnancy itself is unique. It imposes unique physical demands and risks on women and, in fact, has impact on all of their lives, on their ability to care for other children, other family members, on their ability to work,” she said.  The fixation on safe haven laws by some of the nation’s most prominent anti-abortion legal scholars punctuated their decades-long collaboration with safe haven activists, said Laury Oaks, a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of a book on safe haven laws and reproductive justice. The anti-abortion movement’s connection to safe haven laws is “so prominent,” Oaks said. “Amy Coney Barrett very publicly connected the dots.” What does a post-Roe America mean for safe havens? Maybe not much Safe havens are unlikely to see a meaningful surge in popularity in a post-Roe America, according to Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University, who has written about safe haven laws. Without the protection Roe v. Wade provided, women will face more challenges in obtaining abortions: They will have less time to make a decision, and it may be more difficult to get one. This could mean women will seek out more dangerous options, including some self-induced abortion methods. “Changing the rules on abortion does not really change whether people want an abortion or even whether they’re able to get it, but it changes how it happens,” Grossman said. For those women who want an abortion and are unable to obtain one, even legally, they typically won’t turn to safe havens or adoption. Most women will probably choose to raise the babies themselves, according to data from the Turnaway Study, which was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, and examined the effects of unwanted pregnancy on nearly 1,000 women’s lives over the course of five years. The study revealed that for women who sought an abortion but were denied one, just 9% decided to put the baby up for adoption.   The Supreme Court’s three liberal justices touched on the study in their dissenting opinion and on the conservative majority’s focus on safe haven laws.  “The majority briefly notes the growing prevalence of safe haven laws and demand for adoption,” wrote Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. “The reality is that few women denied an abortion will choose adoption. The vast majority will continue, just as in Roe and Casey’s time, to shoulder the costs of childrearing.” Several experts told CNN that activists and governments should instead focus on how to prevent babies from being deposited at safe haven sites to begin with.  Oaks, the author of a book on safe haven laws, talked about the need for more awareness around existing social welfare programs so women can raise babies themselves. Haney, who works at the American Academy of Pediatrics, argued for, among other things, better paid parental leave and robust mental health support for new mothers. Sanger, the Columbia law school professor, said the United States needs to provide women with more options — including early access to abortion — before they feel the only choice is to abandon their baby.  “I don’t think that safe havens should be celebrated,” Sanger said.  CNN’s Casey Tolan contributed to this report.

312,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/health/california-newsom-state-of-emergency-monkeypox/,"The governors of California and Illinois declared states of emergency to bolster their monkeypox vaccination efforts as the virus spreads nationwide. Monday’s declarations come as more than 5,800 probable or confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported in the US. California had more than 800 cases Tuesday, while Illinois had more than 500, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the World Health Organization has declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the Biden administration has not issued a nationwide public health emergency declaration. California is the third and largest state to issue a statewide declaration related to the disease. New York was the first to do so. California’s move allows emergency medical services personnel throughout the state to administer FDA-approved monkeypox vaccines, expanding the pool of people able to inoculate residents against the virus even as a vaccine shortage persists. “Expanding the pool of eligible vaccinators will substantially aid current efforts and support anticipated further vaccination efforts upon receipt of additional doses from the federal government,” the proclamation said. “California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release.  Illinois’ declaration also will make more resources available to combat the virus, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. The Chicago and state public health departments announced Illinois’ first presumptive case June 2.  “I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and coordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating, and preventing the spread of MPV,” Pritzker tweeted. “In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBTQ+ community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.” Monkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox, that usually causes pimple- or blister-like lesions, as well as flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills and respiratory symptoms, according to the CDC. The virus can spread to anyone through close, often skin-to-skin contact, according to the CDC. It’s also possible for people to get monkeypox from infected animals. California has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses so far and distributed more than 25,000, according to the governor’s news release. Los Angeles County has received its own vaccine allocation, and state officials said California will make additional allocations in the coming weeks.  Last week, San Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency on monkeypox. “We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” the California governor said. California has been using testing, contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure built for the Covid-19 pandemic to respond to monkeypox outbreaks, Newsom’s office said. The CDC has made the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease, but access is limited in California. Now, the treatment can be administered at more than 30 facilities and providers across the state, officials said. California has also expanded its monkeypox testing capacity and can process more than 1,000 tests a week, according to Newsom. The state’s first case of monkeypox was reported May 21 and involved someone who had traveled abroad. Now, there are probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 27 different local health jurisdictions, including a case involving a toddler. In mid-July, California’s health department requested 600,000 to 800,000 additional monkeypox vaccine doses to help expand eligibility to both confirmed and probable exposures, as well as to high-risk individuals.  The health department is “hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state’s request,” it said in a news release Friday. As of last week, the US Department of Health and Human Services had delivered more than 336,000 doses of Jynneos – an FDA-approved vaccine created for smallpox and monkeypox – from the strategic national stockpile. Health authorities throughout the country have been focused on education efforts to inform Americans about how monkeypox spreads.  Monkeypox, according to the CDC, can spread via “respiratory secretions” and by touching objects contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. Many of the cases in the latest outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, but monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.  A large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts on this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact. “Our team is also committed to reducing stigma among the LGBTQ community, which has been singled out and treated unfairly because of this outbreak. No single individual or community is to blame for the spread of any virus. Monkeypox can affect anyone as it spreads by skin-to-skin contact, as well as from sharing items like clothing, bedding and towels,” California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said in a Friday statement. Following the emergency declaration in California, Equality California, a major LGBT rights nonprofit organization, applauded the governor’s move, noting in a statement that the virus “continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men here in California and across the country.” Earlier Monday, state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, and members of the LGBTQ caucus called on Newsom to issue $38.5 million in an emergency budget appropriation to support local monkeypox response.

305,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/health/coronavirus-children-omicron-school-vaccine-wellness/,"Many children are returning to schools while coronavirus case numbers are high in most of the United States. Parents and caregivers have a lot of questions about what precautions they should take for their children. Do their kids need to wear masks again? How often should they test their kids? Do they need to hold back on any extracurriculars? What happens if their kids contract Covid-19 — how long should they stay out of school? And should families get their children vaccinated if they haven’t already? To guide us through this back-to-school refresher, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health” and the mother of two young children who will both be returning back to school soon. CNN: The question on a lot of parents’ and caregivers’ minds is masks. Will you be sending your children back to school with masks? Dr. Leana Wen: No, although I respect other parents and caregivers who are making a different decision from us based on how they view the risk of Covid-19 versus the downside of masking for their children. Masks, especially well-fitting, high-quality masks, can reduce coronavirus transmission. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends indoor masking based on the Covid-19 community level. I think it’s reasonable for parents and caregivers to follow the CDC guidelines and decide that if the Covid-19 level is high in their area, they will ask their children to mask indoors at school. Masking will reduce their children’s risk of contracting the coronavirus and remains advisable for families for whom avoiding Covid-19 is a top priority, such as those with immunocompromised household members. I also think it’s reasonable for parents and caregivers to make a different risk calculus. Children are already at low risk for severe illness from Covid-19. Vaccination further reduces that risk. In addition, the currently circulating variants are so contagious that it’s quite hard to avoid infection. Some families could decide that they are not prioritizing avoiding infection anymore, and therefore are choosing not to mask their children at school. That’s what my family has decided. Our views have changed a lot since the beginning of the pandemic, when there was much unknown about the impact of Covid-19 on children. At that time, we followed extremely strict precautions, including masking at all times indoors and only associating with others outdoors. For us, the turning point was after Omicron came to dominate, because it became even more difficult to avoid Covid-19 despite precautions. Getting our children vaccinated also gave us even more reassurance that we could replace masking with the protection that vaccination provides. We know our children could still get Covid-19, but the risk of severe illness is very low.  There is also the question of the perceived cost of masking to our children. Our kids’ school is not requiring masks and based on our conversations with other families, very few parents are going to choose to mask their kids. My almost 5-year-old, who is starting kindergarten, has speech delays that have improved since his schools went mask-optional in the spring. My 2-year-old, who is just starting preschool, does not consistently wear masks anyway. For us, the benefit of requiring our kids to mask does not outweigh the downside at the moment. That could change if a more dangerous variant were to emerge in the future. CNN: Are there circumstances where you’d advise parents and caregivers to mask their kids at school? Wen: It all comes down to how much the family wants to avoid Covid-19. Let’s say that there is a medically vulnerable member of the household who could become very sick if they contracted the coronavirus. It would make sense for everyone in that household to be extra cautious in order to not infect that person. Families could also decide to mask before visiting vulnerable loved ones. For example, if a grandparent who is immunocompromised is coming to stay for a week, the kids can mask in school the week before and during that visit. I’d further advise that the kids take rapid tests right before the grandparent arrives, and that everyone — including the adults — avoid indoor gatherings for the week before and during the visit. CNN: Speaking of testing, how often should families be testing their kids? Wen: Some schools may have a regular testing cadence or a random testing protocol to evaluate the level of Covid-19 in their student body. Others may just ask that kids be tested if they are symptomatic or have a known exposure. Again, how much families want to test their kids will depend on the degree to which they want to avoid the coronavirus. Many families see Covid-19 as they do any other viral illness, while some are still very cautious to try to avoid it for a number of reasons, including the unknown future risk of long Covid. CNN: Should parents and caregivers hold back on any extracurriculars or playdates for their kids? Wen: Any decision-making needs to weigh the desire to avoid Covid-19 versus the downside of keeping children away from activities that they would enjoy. Given our family’s risk calculus, I am not holding back on activities for my children. My son is playing soccer, which sometimes happens indoors. My daughter is in a music class with lots of singing, which is mostly indoors. We are going on playdates, both outdoors and indoors.  By the way, this is not to say that my family isn’t following any precautions. My husband and I mask at airports and on trains. We are not taking our kids to the aquarium or science center when it’s super crowded, with tons of people packed together. We are not trying to contract Covid-19 — but we are also not going to change our lives as we have for most of the pandemic to try to avoid it. And we fully understand if other parents may decide to be more cautious and stick with primarily outdoor activities.  CNN: What happens if kids contract Covid-19 — how long should they stay out of school? What if someone in their family gets Covid?  Wen: The CDC guidelines say that people who contract Covid-19 should isolate for five days and then can return to public settings with a well-fitting mask for the next five days. People exposed to Covid-19, if they are up to date with vaccines, do not need to quarantine and can return to public settings as long as they are masked for 10 days, test after five days and remain asymptomatic. That’s what our family will do if we get infected again.  Some schools have different protocols than this, so make sure to check with your school to make sure you are following their rules. CNN: Should families get their children vaccinated if they haven’t already? Wen: Yes. A recent large study, just published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that during a time of Omicron predominance, two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reduced hospitalizations by 83% among children 5 to 11. Vaccination also reduced infection by 65%. This and multiple other studies demonstrate how vaccination is crucial in reducing the likelihood of severe infection and symptomatic illness in children. Both of my kids got their vaccines as soon as they were eligible. (My kids are both younger than 5; children 5 and older are eligible for boosters, though most have not gotten them.)  For me, the calculation came down to this. I knew that even without vaccines, their chance of severe illness is very low. But if I can reduce the chance of something bad happening even more, I would want to do that. And now, with vaccination, I am comfortable with my children resuming pre-pandemic normal activities, even during a surge of Covid-19.",Leana Wen;Leana Wen;Sanjay Gupta,Public Health;Public Health;Us Centers For Disease;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States,"UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1523;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,441;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,740;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,915;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1184;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1800;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2470;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3250;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3876;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4538;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6741;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,7292;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,441;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,740;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,915;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1184;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1800;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2470;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3250;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3876;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,4538;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6741;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,7292;GENERAL_HEALTH,591;TAX_FNCACT_CAREGIVERS,134;TAX_FNCACT_CAREGIVERS,1265;TAX_FNCACT_CAREGIVERS,1656;TAX_FNCACT_CAREGIVERS,2074;TAX_FNCACT_CAREGIVERS,3847;TAX_FNCACT_CAREGIVERS,5439;EDUCATION,43;EDUCATION,946;EDUCATION,1018;EDUCATION,3485;EDUCATION,4880;EDUCATION,7216;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,43;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,946;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,1018;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,3485;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,4880;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,7216;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,757;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,840;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,18;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,217;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,479;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,873;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1169;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1403;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1774;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1836;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2118;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2460;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2642;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2943;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,3087;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,3234;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,5612;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,5741;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,7379;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,7642;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,7844;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,8094;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,8443;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,61;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,1482;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,1872;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,4082;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,5209;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,393;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1353;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1592;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1715;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1932;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,2175;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,2630;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,2901;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,3112;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,3950;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,4977;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,5237;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,5572;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,6425;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,6693;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,6851;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,6976;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,8516;",Massachusetts;Worcester;United States

169,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/desantis-suspends-prosecutor/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday suspended Tampa’s elected prosecutor, Andrew Warren, for pledging not to use his office to go after people who seek and provide abortions or on doctors that provide gender affirming care to transgender people.  In his executive order, DeSantis accused Warren of “neglect of duty” and “incompetence” as the state attorney of Hillsborough County. “To take a position that you have veto powers over the laws of the state is untenable,” DeSantis said at a press conference in Tampa surrounded by law enforcement.  Warren responded hours later, accusing DeSantis of “trying to overthrow democracy here in Hillsborough County.”  At a previously planned news conference, during which he unveiled two suspects in a pair of 40-year-old cold case murders, Warren defiantly declared: “I’m still the duly elected state attorney of Hillsborough County.”  “If the governor thinks he can do a better job, then he should run for state attorney or not President,” Warren said, referencing reports that DeSantis is widely considered to be a contender for the GOP nomination in 2024. Warren did not say if he intends to pursue legal action to void the suspension, nor is it clear what happens if he attempts to continue working as the state attorney. Earlier Thursday, the website for the Office of The State Attorney 13th Judicial Circuit of Florida was placed in “maintenance mode.” By evening, it was back online and featured DeSantis’ appointee to replace Warren, Hillsborough County Circuit Court Judge Susan Lopez. The move by DeSantis, a Republican, to remove a Democrat twice elected by Hillsborough voters drew an immediate and sharp rebuke from Democratic state lawmakers and officials. Minority Leader Sen. Lauren Book said DeSantis was “behaving more like a dictator than ‘America’s governor.’” And Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, a Democratic candidate for governor, called Warren’s suspension “a politically motivated attack on a universally respected state attorney democratically elected to exercise prosecutorial discretion.” “Ron DeSantis is a pathetic bully,” Fried said. DeSantis said the decision to suspend Warren came after he directed staff to review whether any state attorneys in Florida had taken it “upon themselves to determine which laws they like and will enforce,” after watching prosecutors in other states decline to press charges for certain crimes. That review led them to Warren, who has become a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform and overturning wrongful convictions.  “The governor should not have had to come to Hillsborough County and clean up our mess,” former Tampa police chief Brian Dugan said during the press conference. “That’s really what it comes down to.” Under Florida law, a governor can remove “any county officer” for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony. The Florida Senate has the power to reinstate a suspended official or remove that person from office.  “It’s not a dereliction of duty,” Warren told CNN’s Laura Coates Thursday evening. “In fact, it’s not even talking about things that I’ve done in the office. It is talking about things I may do in the future… I mean this is out of, like, 1984 Orwellian thought police.” Warren maintained he’s always used his prosecutorial discretion to consider charges on a “case-by-case” basis. DeSantis appointed Lopez to serve as state attorney during Warren’s suspension. He previously appointed Lopez to circuit court judge in Hillsborough County. DeSantis told reporters that he did not speak to Warren ahead of the announcement.  Warren was first elected to state attorney in 2016, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent in a narrow race that predicted the bellwether Florida county’s leftward turn. He was reelected in 2020, winning a higher percentage of the vote in Hillsborough County than President Joe Biden.  During his first years in office, Warren kept a relatively low profile as he quietly modernized the office and adopted criminal justice reforms. In 2018, he endorsed the reelection campaign of the county’s elected Republican sheriff, Chad Chronister, and often held press conferences with law enforcement. In turn, Chronister praised Warren in the months leading up to the Democrat’s campaign for a second term.  But Chronister hosted Thursday’s press conference at the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office and delivered a biting critique of Warren while standing next to DeSantis. (Chronister’s wife, Nicole DeBartolo, and father-in-law, Edward DeBartolo, a former NFL owner granted a presidential pardon by Donald Trump, have donated a combined $472,000 to DeSantis’ reelection campaign.) Warren grew increasingly critical of DeSantis during the pandemic. Early in the coronavirus outbreak, he publicly bashed the governor’s decision to allow megachurches to operate in Florida just days after the arrest of a Tampa pastor who defiantly held in-person service. Later that summer, Warren announced he wouldn’t prosecute 67 people arrested in a protest following the death of George Floyd.  But it was Warren’s foray into the country’s political divide over transgender and abortion care that sparked Thursday’s action from DeSantis. Warren last year joined dozens of local and state prosecutor who signed onto a letter authored by the progressive organization Fair and Just Prosecution denouncing laws that criminalize doctors that provide gender affirming care for transgender people. After the US Supreme Court voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate constitutional protections for abortion, Warren signed another letter from Fair and Justice promising to use discretion not to use “limited criminal legal system resources” to prosecute those who seek, provide or support abortions.  The position on abortion put Warren at odds with a new state law that bans abortion in Florida after 15 weeks. DeSantis, who last year signed a ban on transgender girls and women participating in scholastic sports as a female, has also taken steps to ban gender affirming care for children, which he called on Thursday “literally chopping off the private parts of young kids.” “Those are really, I think, egregious and again, it’s beyond just exercising discretion,” DeSantis said.  DeSantis has used his power to remove certain elected officials more than his predecessors. In one of his first actions as governor, DeSantis suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who oversaw the police response to the deadly mass shooting at a Parkland high school.  But past suspensions were a result of actions already taken by elected officials. Warren’s suspension is in part for actions yet to be taken. Notably, the state’s new abortion law is facing a legal challenge and one judge said it violated the state’s constitutional, though a higher court said otherwise.  Warren said he had not read DeSantis’ executive order but he said he “heard it contains a lot of conjecture and lies.” “Just based on the governor’s track record with unconstitutional orders,” Warren said, “I have a feeling that this is going to be just as unconstitutional.” This story has been updated with additional developments.",Andrew Warren;Donald Trump;Joe Biden;George Floyd;Ron Desantis;Ron Desantis;Edward Debartolo;Brian Dugan;Susan Lopez;Nicole Debartolo,Florida Senate;Us Supreme Court;Cnn,"APPOINTMENT,2309;APPOINTMENT,2398;EDUCATION,5486;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,379;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1051;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2348;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2594;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTORS,206;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTORS,4370;LEADER,758;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINALS,321;DEMOCRACY,742;DEMOCRACY,928;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,92;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,4239;",Broward County;America;Tampa;Florida;Hillsborough County

Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKB) reported Saturday that the massive conglomerate posted a net loss of nearly $44 billion in the second quarter, red ink that was due mostly to a big drop in the value of Berkshire’s significant stock portfolio.  Berkshire owns large stakes in Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Bank of America\n            \n                (BAC), Coca-Cola\n            \n                (KO), Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and American Express\n            \n                (AXP). Those five stocks make up nearly 70% of the portfolio. Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and Coke have both rallied this year but tech stocks and financials have been significant market losers. But the steep loss in the value of Berkshire’s portfolio is not the whole story. The firm actually reported an operating profit of $9.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 40% from a year ago.  That gain was due in part to higher interest rates boosting portions of its colossal insurance unit. There were also jumps in earnings from Berkshire’s railroad, utility and energy businesses.  Berkshire owns Geico, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy Company as well as big consumer brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, Dairy Queen and a large stake in Kraft Heinz\n            \n                (KHC). Big rebound for Berkshire in the past two years Berkshire’s many businesses have bounced back sharply from the depths of the Covid-induced slowdown in the economy in 2020. “Because the Covid-19 pandemic negatively impacted most businesses, including Berkshire, in early 2020, comparing current results to pre-pandemic 2019 results is helpful” Bill Stone, chief investment officer of the Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder, said in a report. “Operating earnings for the second quarter of 2022 are 51% above 2019.”  But many investors pay close attention to Berkshire to see what Buffett, vice chairman Charlie Munger and top Berkshire investing lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs think about the stock market. Apparently they remain bullish.  Berkshire reported about $3.8 billion in net stock purchases during the second quarter. That’s on top of the more than $40 billion in stocks Berkshire bought during the first quarter.  Buffett’s firm also bought back $1 billion of its own shares during the quarter, a move that helps boost earnings per share.  Berkshire has been aggressive throughout the market downturn, scooping up a sizable stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY) and announcing an $11.6 billion deal for insurer Alleghany earlier this year. The company’s stock has held up better than the rest of the market in 2022. The super pricy class A shares, which trade for around $445,000 apiece because they don’t split, are down about 2%. So are the shares of the class B stock, which cost a little less than $300 each and are in the S&P 500. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said in a report after the earnings release that she sees “stable results in most segments” for Berkshire.  Shares of both classes of Berkshire Hathaway were up slightly in early morning trading Monday. Buffett, who will turn 92 on August 30, has given no indication that he plans to step back from his roles as Berkshire CEO and top portfolio manager just yet.  But the company has already announced that Greg Abel, the 60-year old vice chairman of all of Berkshire’s energy and other non-insurance units, will eventually take over for Buffett.

408,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/weather/kentucky-flood-threat-forecast/,"Those still recovering from the deadly floods just a week ago in eastern Kentucky find themselves under threat for more heavy rain and flash flooding. “We’ve got (river) conditions right now that we don’t typically see prolonged at this time of year over a large area where it just makes us more susceptible to flooding than we would normally be at this time of year,” Hal Klingenberg, Lead Forecaster at the National Weather Service in Jackson, Kentucky told CNN Friday morning. “For most areas, we’re looking at an inch and a half to two inches of rain to occur in a relatively short time within one to three hours to start causing significant problems once again,” Klingenberg said. Storms on Friday will be capable of producing very heavy rainfall rates, prompting the Weather Prediction Center to issue a slight risk level of excessive rainfall for the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys into the Mid-Atlantic.  For portions of Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia, WPC says Friday is “more of a higher end slight risk with isolated to scattered flash flooding likely, but less confidence on a more widespread/organized risk.” Klingenberg, who had several coworkers directly impacted by the devastating floods said, “You tend to pay a lot closer attention once you’ve been hurt and once you’ve been hit by something like a natural disaster.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear gave an update on Friday, the eighth day of flooding in the state, confirming that the death toll of 37 across five counties has not increased.  “While we have thousands that lost their home that we need to stabilize, steady progress is being made and real, significant progress — especially over the last eight days,” he said. The governor said officials were focused on conducting wellness checks Friday due to concerns about slow moving thunderstorms that could lead to heavy rainfall on Saturday. He added that nine cooling centers remain open in different counties as heat conditions are expected to increase after the storm.  Beshear said President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit east Kentucky on Monday to meet with  families affected by the devastation of the flooding and survey recovery efforts at the local Disaster Recovery Center, operated by the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Flood watches are in place for most of Kentucky, southern Ohio and Indiana, stretching eastward to Maryland as heavy rain over the next two to three days could lead to flash flooding. An area of heavy rain is moving through Kentucky and Tennessee Friday, with the bulk of the activity expected to reach the flood damaged areas of eastern Kentucky Friday afternoon into evening. “One of the high resolution models is indicating the possibility of up to nine inches of rainfall in the next 48 hours across a part of southern Kentucky. The precise location of that event will certainly shift as time goes by, but it is an indication of the tropical nature of the potential downpours and their severity,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers explained. In the longer term, even more rain is forecast for residents in eastern Kentucky Sunday into Wednesday, as a cold front approaches the region bringing renewed rounds of thunderstorms heightening the threat for even more flooding. Flood threat from Ohio Valley into Appalachians  A nearly stationary boundary stretches all the way from the Central Plains through portions of the Ohio Valley and up into eastern Canada, creating the focus of heavy rainfall over the next few days. “Although the latest models are significantly different as to the location of the heaviest rain, all are showing more pockets of flooding possible through Sunday across the entire Ohio Valley,” Myers said. Another area to watch this weekend will be the Appalachians in West Virginia, western Virginia into South Carolina for what are called terrain-locked storms.   “Most of the current flood events have occurred from training thunderstorms, this weekend storms could become locked in one place as the topography prohibits their movement and enhances their accumulation” Myers said.

298,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/entertainment/bullet-train-review/,"“Bullet Train” certainly moves at an appropriately brisk pace, with Brad Pitt heading a sprawling cast. But the breakneck action is offset by a smart-alecky tone that proves both uneven and occasionally too cute for its own good, along with a mashup of styles – from the music to the visuals – that comes across like a Quentin Tarantino wannabe, with a dash of “Deadpool” for good measure. That latter influence shouldn’t be surprising, since director David Leitch oversaw the “Deadpool” sequel, in addition to toiling in the “John Wick” and “Fast & Furious” franchises. The Tarantino echoes are also heightened by Pitt’s presence, having shown off his playfully macho side in that director’s films, most recently winning an Oscar for “Once Upon a Time in … Hollywood.” The story, however – which screenwriter Zak Olkewicz adapted from Japanese novel – doesn’t possess enough fuel to consistently sustain that tone. Even extensive flashbacks to get the narrative out of its confined space can’t add enough intrigue to the machinations of these strangers on a train. Joining the story in progress, Pitt’s bad-luck hitman (codenamed Ladybug) boards a bullet train in Japan, with orders to acquire a briefcase full of cash. Alas, he’s not the only skilled assassin on board, with each pursuing different marching orders, confusion as to who’s pulling the strings and a whole lot of miscommunication along the way. If Pitt’s world-weary character just wants to complete the assignment and disembark, others harbor more personal motives. The various factions range from a mysterious young woman (Joey King) to a squabbling pair of operatives referred to as “twins” (Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry) to a revenge-minded killer played by Benito A. Martínez Ocasio, a.k.a. Bad Bunny. That barely scratches the surface of the cast, including cameos clearly intended to provide little rewards to the audience. The tradeoff, though, is that some more recognizable faces appear so briefly as to barely register. The claustrophobic setting actually works to the advantage of staging the fight sequences, which are brutal, bloody and frequently played for laughs. Indeed, more than one mimics the interrupted showdown in “Kill Bill,” including the amusing dilemma of how to try to kill somebody without violating the rules of the train’s “quiet car.” For the most part, though, “Bullet Train” underscores the challenges in trying to infuse this kind of movie with the qualities of a live-action cartoon, even if the goal is two hours of unpretentious escapism. This isn’t another sequel, which in this genre almost by itself feels like cause for celebration; still, nor does the movie feel remotely original. Perhaps that’s why even though the resulting ride isn’t without thrills, in terms of punching a ticket for the theater, it’s hard to recommend catching this “Train.” “Bullet Train” premieres Aug. 5 in US theaters.

431,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/pennsylvania-house-fire-ten-dead/,"Ten people – including three children – have died following a house fire in Nescopeck, Pennsylvania, early Friday morning, state police confirmed to CNN.  The victims range in age from 5 to 79 years old, according to authorities. Nescopeck is roughly 95 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Authorities responded to the scene of a two-story house fire a little before 3 a.m. Friday, according to a public information report from state police. Three adults made it out safely, while the 10 victims were located dead inside.  “Firefighters attempted courageous efforts to make entry into the house in the rear, but were pushed back from extensive flames and heat,” State Police Lt. Derek Felsman said in a Friday morning news conference.  The victims were identified by state police as Dale Baker, 19; Star Baker, 22; David Daubert Sr., 79; Brian Daubert, 42; Shannon Daubert, 45; Laura Daubert, 47; and Marian Slusser, 54. The three children killed were identified as two boys, ages 5 and 6, and a girl, age 7. “We are utilizing multiple department assets to ensure a thorough and complete investigation into this fatal fire,” Felsman said. The house was “completely destroyed,” by the blaze, state police said. When asked whether authorities were conducting a criminal investigation into the blaze, Felsman responded that “it’s a fire investigation at this time.” The cause of the fire is under investigation, Luzerne County District Attorney Sam Sanguedolce told CNN. “Should the fire marshals determine the cause to be intentional and incendiary, we would begin a criminal investigation for arson,” he said. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he was “heartbroken” over the loss of life.  “Our prayers are with their loved ones,” the governor wrote on Twitter. “Thank you to the many first responders who rushed to the scene.” The American Red Cross said it was responding to the needs of people displaced by the fire through financial support and other services, including mental health resources for those affected and first responders. “As this situation continues to develop, we are committed to the community of Nescopeck and will, in coordination with local and county officials, bring our support and programs to help those affected by this tragedy,”  the American Red Cross Greater Pennsylvania Region told CNN in a statement.

272,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/doj-election-threats-task-force/,"A task force launched by the Justice Department last year to investigate threats against election workers looked at more than 1,000 contacts “reported as hostile or harassing” and said about 11% of those “met the threshold for a federal criminal investigation.” The findings were presented at a briefing on Monday with US Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite and a bipartisan group of about 750 election officials and workers from across the country as they prepare for the midterm elections. The Election Threats Task Force, which was created last year to address an increasing number of election workers’ concerns over ongoing threats against them, also found that in instances where a source of reported contact was identified, “in 50% of the matters, the source contacted the victim on multiple occasions.” Aside from the 11% of the contacts that merited a federal investigation, “the remaining reported contacts did not provide a predication for a federal criminal investigation,” the Justice Department said in a news release announcing the findings on Monday. “While many of the contacts were often hostile, harassing, and abusive towards election officials, they did not include a threat of unlawful violence.” The task force also found that election workers in states with close elections were more likely to receive threats. According to the news release, “58% of the total of potentially criminal threats were in states that underwent 2020 post-election lawsuits, recounts, and audits, such as Arizona, Georgia, Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin.” The states listed by the Justice Department are all battlegrounds where former President Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden. The task force has brought four federal criminal cases so far, the Justice Department said, and plans to bring more cases in the near future. In one case, a Massachusetts man was arrested on Friday after being indicted by a grand jury for allegedly making a bomb threat last year toward an election official in the Arizona’s Secretary of State office. CNN previously reported that election officials are increasingly worried about their safety as midterm season approaches. Kim Wyman, the top election security official at the federal US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in June that physical security concerns have “really ramped up since 2020 because of threats that we’ve seen to state and local officials across the country.” In light of the ongoing threats, officials were also provided at Monday’s briefing with resources for seeking funding geared toward increased security at election offices.

154,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/entertainment/angelica-ross-chicago-first-trans-actress-cec/,"“Chicago” is Broadway’s longest-running revival – and even after more than 25 years, the production is still making history.  Next month, the leading role of fame-hungry murderess Roxie Hart will be played by Angelica Ross, the production announced Thursday. Ross will be the first out transgender actress to step into Roxie’s T-strap shoes on Broadway, according to the Hollywood Reporter, and one of the first trans women to play a leading role on Broadway. Ross is best known for her role as Candy Ferocity, a young trans woman who regularly competed in New York’s ballroom scene, on the Emmy-winning series “Pose.” The FX drama featured the largest cast of trans actors on a TV series, outlets reported ahead of its 2018 premiere. With her casting, Ross joins a small but formidable group of Black trans women who’ve bowed on Broadway: In 2018, Peppermint of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” fame starred in the Go-Go’s musical “Head Over Heels,” and this season, L Morgan Lee earned a Tony nomination for her role in best musical winner “A Strange Loop.” The upcoming revival of “1776” will also include trans and nonbinary cast members.  CNN has reached out to “Chicago” and reps for Ross for further comment. The “Pose” star begins performances on September 12, the production said.  Ross is the latest star to play Roxie on Broadway: Earlier this year, actress and animal advocate Pamela Anderson made her Broadway debut in the role.",Roxie Hart;Pamela Anderson;L Morgan Lee;Angelica Ross,Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,437;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,824;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,547;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,308;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,1347;MEDIA_MSM,406;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,406;LGBT,300;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,812;",Hollywood;New York;Chicago
126,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/alabama-kidnapping-leads-to-corpse-discovery/,"A kidnapped girl’s escape in Alabama has led to the discovery of two decomposing bodies and the arrest of a man now facing murder and kidnapping charges, authorities said. Police got a call Monday morning from a driver about a 12-year-old girl walking alone along County Road 34 in Dadeville, Tallapoosa County Sheriff Jimmy Abbett said Tuesday at a news conference.  The girl had been restrained to bed posts for about a week, according to a criminal complaint. She had chewed off her restraints – breaking her braces – and her wrists show marks consistent with restraint, it states.  The 12-year-old had been given alcohol to stay “in a drugged state” and was assaulted in the “head area,” the complaint states. She had not been reported missing, the sheriff said.  Jose Paulino Pascual-Reyes, 37, was arrested Monday about 25 miles away in Auburn on suspicion of first-degree kidnapping by US Marshals and police, the sheriff said, adding other agencies are also on the case.  While searching Pascual-Reyes’ home, detectives found two decomposed bodies, the sheriff said. A forensics team is working to identify the corpses, he said, and how and when they died wasn’t immediately known. The sheriff further stated that “other people” were living in the residence. The sheriff did not say whether these people were being charged or held in connection with the alleged crimes at the residence. Pascual-Reyes also faces three counts of capital murder and two counts of abuse of corpse, Abbett said in a news release.  “We’re looking at multiple counts of capital murder, along with kidnapping in the first degree,” Tallapoosa County District Attorney Jeremy Duerr said during the news conference. “And of course, once we continue and finish our investigation, I feel certain that several more charges will follow.” Pascual-Reyes had a bond hearing from the Tallapoosa County Jail on Wednesday afternoon, and is being held on no bond, according to Abbett, who said he was appointed to attorneys. CNN has reached out to the public defender’s office for comment. “This is horrendous to have a crime scene of this nature and also a 12-year-old juvenile to deal with this horrendous situation,” Abbett said, calling the girl “a hero.” While the Sheriff did not give any details about when the girl might have been kidnapped or any possible relationship with Pascual-Reyes, he did say she had received medical care and was doing well. “She’s safe now and … we want to keep her that way,” Abbett said. The child, who was appointed an attorney, is now with the Alabama Department of Human Resources, according to the sheriff, who said he checked in on the girl on Wednesday. “She’s doing as well as can be expected considering the circumstances,” Abbett said.

467,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/india/india-us-military-exercise-line-of-actual-control-china-intl-hnk/,"The United States is to take part in a joint military exercise with India less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the South Asian country’s disputed border with China. The military drills will be held in mid-October at an altitude of 10,000 feet in Auli in the Indian state of Uttarakhand and will focus on high-altitude warfare training, according to a senior Indian Army officer with knowledge of the matter.   Auli is about 95 kilometers from the Line of Actual Control (LAC), an inhospitable piece of land where the disputed border between India and China is roughly demarcated.  The drills will take place as part of the 18th edition of an annual joint exercise known as “Yudh Abhyas” – or “War Practice”. Relations between India and China have been strained since a bloody clash between their soldiers in the Himalayas in June 2020 left at least 20 Indian troops and four Chinese soldiers dead. Tensions have been raised further recently by China building a bridge across the Pangong Tso lake that sits along the border – a move condemned by the Indian government as an “illegal occupation.” During a visit to India this year, the US Army’s Pacific Commanding General Charles Flynn described China’s military build-up near the disputed border as “alarming.” Asked about the joint exercises, a US Department of Defense spokesperson told CNN that the partnership with India was “one of the most important elements of our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”   “One important element of this broader effort includes exercises and training events and Yudh Abhyas is one such annual bilateral exercise designed to improve interoperability and improve our respective capacities to address a range of regional security challenges,” the spokesperson said.   Line of Actual Control The Line of Actual Control, the loosely-defined, de facto border between India and China, emerged out of the Sino-Indian border war of 1962, which itself was sparked by longstanding historical territorial disagreements.  Its precise location can be blurry, and there is still dispute between China and India as to where one country ends and the other begins.  Any military provocations between Indian and China could have grave consequences. Both have nuclear weapons. Border tensions escalated between the two countries after soldiers fought with fists, stones and nail-studded bamboo poles in a bloody brawl that killed at least 20 Indian soldiers in June 2020 in the Galwan Valley, close to Aksai Chin, an area controlled by China but claimed by both countries. Though tensions have since eased, both sides maintain a large troop presence in the border region, raising the risk of potential miscalculation in the event of sudden and unexpected clashes.

341,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/hondo-texas-nra-fundraiser/,"A fundraiser for a charity affiliated with the powerful National Rifle Association won’t be held as planned Saturday at a municipal facility in Texas after relatives of children slaughtered in May at an elementary school some 40 miles away lobbied city council members to deny the event its venue. As some attendees held photos of Robb Elementary School shooting victims, the Hondo City Council voted 4-to-1 Monday to revoke a rental agreement that would have allowed members of the Medina Area Friends of NRA to hold a fundraiser at a site owned by the city of about 8,000 residents. The move came as the carnage in nearby Uvalde – the most deadly US school shooting in nearly a decade – has reignited debate over US gun laws and public safety.  Before Monday’s vote, Jazmin Cazares, whose sister died in the Uvalde massacre, addressed council members, naming each Uvalde victim – 19 fourth-graders and two teachers – and describing how at least some survivors would perceive the NRA charity event publicized as including a gun raffle with a chance at an AR-15, the group’s Facebook page states.  Investigators found one of the 18-year-old Uvalde shooter’s AR-15-style rifles in the school after law enforcement killed him. “It is a slap in the face to all of Uvalde, especially the ones that lost a loved one, some of us being here today. What’s an even harder slap in the face is the AR-15 you get if you donate $5,000 to the NRA,” she said. “What you guys decide to do next with this NRA meeting either proves me right or proves me wrong about how I feel about Hondo.” Nikki Cross, whose relative Uziyah Garcia was among those killed at Robb Elementary, was “not here protesting the NRA or anything like that,” she said. “I am just here asking your community to take into consideration it’s only been two months for us.” “What happened to ‘love thy neighbor?’ Is that not a thing here? The specific gun that they are giving away in this, what if that falls into the hands of another angry 18-year-old? Then it could be your children that are at risk, and we would stand with you. I am just asking that you postpone it. Give us time to grieve. We are going through enough already,” she added.  Just days after the Uvalde mass shooting, the NRA hosted its annual convention in Houston, with former President Donald Trump and other GOP leaders rejecting nationwide efforts to overhaul gun laws and mocking Democrats and activists calling for change. The foundation that had planned the Hondo event is “not the NRA. Although affiliated, the foundation is a separate legal entity. All the Friends of NRA foundation does is raise funds in furtherance of their charitable and educational mission,” Sandy Steubing, a Hondo resident and volunteer with the charity, said Monday. The annual Medina Area Friends of NRA event has taken place in August for 15 years, “and we’ve been planning this event since March,” she added. The group did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. “These events are planned months in advance with the goal of raising funds for local programs that promote safe and responsible gun ownership. Penalizing hundreds of volunteers and participants at the 11th hour for the crimes of a sick, evil criminal is misguided and wrong,” Lars Dalseide, a spokesperson for the NRA, told CNN by email. Another Texan, identified as Hank C. during public comments, defended the “constitutionally protected event.” “There is no reason for you all to sit up here and vote on it. This is still America, isn’t it?” he told council members. “I don’t even understand why we are having this conversation, guys. Guns aren’t going away.” But he was interrupted by Angel Garza, whose daughter Amerie Jo Garza, was slain at Robb Elementary.  “You have no f**king clue. You have no right to tell us how to feel. You have no right to tell us how to feel. I am stepping out. I am walking out,” said the man, who noted his “daughter died still calling me Daddy; she wasn’t even old enough to get to the stage to call me Dad.” “You don’t know what we are going through. Nobody in this room has a right to tell us how to feel,” he added as he left the room.  Council members adjourned to executive session to vote, then returned to announce their decision.

113,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/missouri-senate-republican-primary-eric-greitens/,"Paula Callihan hasn’t quite decided whom she’s voting for in Tuesday’s crowded GOP Senate primary.   But she knows whom she’s not voting for.   “Eric Greitens scares the crap out of me,” the 67-year-old Joplin resident said last week in this southwest corner of the state. “A machine gun going through killing RINOs. I mean, that’s terrible,” she said, recalling the campaign video that depicted the former Republican governor “hunting” so-called “Republicans in Name Only.”  The candidacy of Greitens, who resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct and is now facing allegations of abuse from his ex-wife, is a big reason why a Senate race in Missouri – a deeply red state – is even part of the national conversation about Washington control in a tough national environment for Democrats.   Greitens, who has denied those allegations, started the race to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt with high name recognition. Only after a super PAC started attacking him on the air this summer did Republicans worried about Greitens losing to a Democrat – or perhaps even winning himself in November – begin to breathe a small sigh of relief.  The great unknown, however, has been former President Donald Trump, who announced Monday that he was endorsing “Eric,” without specifying a last name. Greitens, who is allied with Donald Trump Jr. and his fiancée, and state Attorney General Eric Schmitt were each quick to claim that they were the intended recipient of the endorsement.  “I trust the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds,” the former President added in his statement.  In conversations with about 45 Missourians across the state last week, mostly Republicans, some said they were sticking by Greitens, and even those who weren’t expressed skepticism about the allegations. But the majority said they had issues with the candidate, ranging from “his baggage” to the fact that he was a “quitter” for resigning as governor.   Those frustrations with Greitens have cleared lanes in the GOP primary for US Rep. Vicky Hartzler and Schmitt, who have spent the final days of the race going after one another, with China a frequent flashpoint.   “It’s between us now,” Hartzler said of Schmitt, speaking to a group of voters at a wood-paneled restaurant above the Joplin Stockyards on Tuesday. “He’s a lawyer from St. Louis. I’m a farmer from rural Missouri.” Schmitt and his allies, meanwhile, have pivoted to attacking the congresswoman as he tries to run as a Washington outsider, peppering his stump speech with references to lawsuits he’s filed against the Biden administration.   But they’re only two of the 21 candidates seeking the nomination, which includes another sitting congressman and attorney Mark McCloskey, who uses the infamous image of him and his wife pointing guns at protesters outside their St. Louis home on his campaign yard signs.   With no runoff rules in Missouri, all it takes is a plurality to win. The Democrats have their own crowded field, but it’s the GOP primary that will determine just how competitive this race will be in November.  Voters’ complicated relationship with Greitens   Temperatures lingering above 100 degrees didn’t stop southwest Missouri’s GOP faithful from setting up their lawn chairs Tuesday evening in Neosho to nibble on watermelon and hear two hours’ worth of speeches from candidates up and down the ticket, although Hartzler and McCloskey were the only Senate contenders to show up.  Hartzler, a social conservative backed by the state’s junior senator, Republican Josh Hawley, said early in the race that she wouldn’t vote for Greitens if he was the nominee. “When I need to see a hairdresser, I make an appointment,” she said in one of her first ads, a not-so-subtle allusion to her opponent.   Greitens’ former hairdresser alleged that he had tied her up, coerced her into oral sex and threatened to blackmail her with partially nude photos to cover up their 2015 affair. Greitens’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story, but he told CNN in an interview in February that he did “absolutely” nothing wrong with the hairdresser.  As governor in 2018, he faced calls for impeachment from the GOP-controlled state legislature and a criminal charge – invasion of privacy – related to the affair, which he admitted to while refuting the claim of blackmail. The former Navy SEAL was separately charged with another felony – tampering with computer data – for allegedly misusing a veterans charity’s donor list for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign.   The criminal charges were later dropped. And a former FBI agent investigating the blackmail allegations was later indicted for perjury and tampering with physical evidence. A Missouri ethics panel found “no evidence of any wrongdoing” by Greitens in its investigation of campaign misconduct, although it fined his campaign for not reporting in-kind contributions. The GOP-led state House investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations ultimately led to his resignation.  “It was the thing that I had to do for the people who I love the most, particularly for my boys,” Greitens told CNN in February.   But the headlines for him got worse the following month when his former wife alleged that he had been physically abusive toward his children and her. The anti-Greitens group, Show Me Values PAC, has brought those allegations to living rooms across the state, with a recent ad featuring a female narrator reading from his ex-wife’s affidavit.    “It’s a black eye for Missouri,” 42-year-old Matt Fischer, a Schmitt supporter, said at a rally for the attorney general at Tropical Liqueurs South in Columbia on Wednesday, adding that Greitens has already made “the state look bad.”  “I would have (considered Greitens) if he hadn’t had all of his baggage,” 68-year-old Debbie Brewer said at the Ozark Distillery and Brewery in Osage Beach after attending events for both Schmitt and Hartzler on Wednesday. “We don’t need that distraction.”  Show Me Values PAC has spent more than $6 million against Greitens, according to AdImpact data through Friday.  “Somebody had to do something. Neither Hartzler or Schmitt were laying a glove on him, and he was going to win,” said a Missouri Republican strategist who’s unaffiliated in the primary.  Still, there are degrees of skepticism among some voters about the allegations against Greitens. While some chalked up the most recent ones to an ugly divorce, others suggested, without evidence, that they were “just things being thrown at him” by political opponents, as one woman at the Watermelon Feed in Neosho put it.  “He got a raw deal when he was governor,” 72-year-old Charlie Henry said as he unloaded a case of Busch beer outside the Blue Springs Walmart.   Troy Pierson, 42, of Seneca, said at the Watermelon Feed that he was leaning toward Greitens in the primary but has some reservations over the candidate’s 2018 resignation: “Him doing that makes you wonder whether or not he will stand up and fight, which is a concern, because that’s what we need.”  Disappointment with Greitens for resigning is a familiar refrain, and it’s one Schmitt has made a big part of his closing argument.  “He abused his wife and his kid – assaulted his child – and he quit on Missouri,” Schmitt said at his Columbia rally. “This man is a quitter. And when going gets tough, he got going.”  The threat of last-minute Trump involvement   While the politicians at the Watermelon Feed name-dropped Trump onstage, a life-size cardboard cutout of the former President was notably not front and center but tucked away next to the information tent, where filing out a “straw quiz” qualified you to win South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s book, a $10 Chick-fil-A gift card or .22 ammo.  Trump had previously praised Senate hopeful Billy Long, the congressman who represents much of southwest Missouri, but stopped short of an endorsement. The former President came out with a statement earlier this month saying he would not back Hartzler – a surprise to the six-term lawmaker, who boasts in her stump speech that Twitter has suspended her campaign account for her comments about keeping transgender athletes out of women’s sports.    But her lack of support from Trump didn’t seem to concern GOP voters, even those who haven’t made up their minds. “I thought, well, yeah, because they’re not the same kind of people. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t get things done,” said Trump voter Allison Lupo, 56, who praised Hartzler’s “quiet strength” as she sipped on a drink in a Schmitt koozie at his Columbia rally.  Schmitt’s opening line channels the kind of anti-establishment energy Trump cultivated in Washington. “I get up in the morning and go to work. I sue Joe Biden, I go home, and then I get up the next day and do all that over again.” It goes over well with his crowds, especially those who think Hartzler has been in DC too long, even if they like her as their congresswoman.  “I know the President is considering an endorsement. I’d love to have it,” Schmitt told reporters Wednesday in Columbia. He added that he wouldn’t support Mitch McConnell for Senate leader – an appeal to Trump and his base, who dislike the Kentucky Republican – and would instead like to see Sens. Ted Cruz or Mike Lee, both of whom have endorsed Schmitt, run.  But that’s a pledge Greitens had already made, and one that Hartzler soon made too, releasing a statement the morning after Schmitt’s comments.   Democrats vie for a chance at an uphill battle  The selfie line after Marine veteran Lucas Kunce’s 7 p.m. rally on Wednesday moved so slowly that it was dark by the time the last voters had left the outdoor amphitheater in Columbia.  The Marine veteran is running a populist campaign, on the premise that a Democrat like him can win Missouri by picking off enough voters in rural areas to narrow Republican margins.  “He seems like he’s, you know, down-home people like us,” said Linda Evans, 72, as she was coming out of the Walmart in Blue Springs.  But Kunce has strong primary competition from Trudy Busch Valentine, an heir to the beer fortune, who entered the race late and had invested more than $5 million of her own money through July 28. “Even though she comes from the Anheuser Busch family, it seems that she has a commonsense approach to what our needs are right now,” said 59-year-old Becky Wenzel of Dearborn, while sitting at the Ozark Distillery near her family’s weekend house.  Not all voters share that view.   “Busch comes from money, so she wouldn’t be a good choice,” said John Gaskey, 68, of Gladstone who was vacationing in Lake Ozark.   Valentine, who just scored the endorsement of the St. Louis mayor, pushed back on that criticism, saying in a phone interview with CNN on Thursday, “There is no vote I can buy.”  The independent candidacy of John Wood, a former senior investigator for the House January 6 committee and a self-described “conservative” and “lifelong Republican,” adds an element of uncertainty to the general election. Neither Kunce nor Valentine would admit last week that their challenge in November would be tougher if Greitens weren’t the GOP nominee.  “I don’t think it is, with the two of them in there, splitting the vote,” Kunce said, previewing a potential fall race with Schmitt and Wood. “I mean, you got their little civil war, you know, the country club Republicans versus the Trump side. It’ll be quite the adventure.”  This story has been updated Monday with Trump’s endorsement of “Eric.” ",Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Troy Pierson;Mike Lee;Eric Greitens;Vicky Hartzler;Vicky Hartzler;Vicky Hartzler;Trudy Busch Valentine;Trudy Busch Valentine;Trudy Busch Valentine;Matt Fischer;Kristi Noem;Joe Biden;Linda Evans;Paula Callihan;Charlie Henry;Eric Greiten;Eric Greiten;John Gaskey;Billy Long;Billy Long;Billy Long;Becky Wenzel;Lucas Kunce;Lucas Kunce;Lucas Kunce;John Wood;Josh Hawley;Allison Lupo;Mitch Mcconnell;Mark Mccloskey;Eric Schmitt;Eric Schmitt;Roy Blunt;Debbie Brewer,Walmart;Walmart;Twitter;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Senate Democrat Trudy Busch Valentine;Us Supreme Court;Missouri Farm Bureau;Missouri Farm Bureau;Anheuser Busch,"TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1321;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,8257;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,8632;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,8994;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,9147;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,9978;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,1692;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,7647;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1897;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2931;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,6135;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,7310;ELECTION,2447;ELECTION,6856;ELECTION,9275;ELECTION,11012;ELECTION,11199;ELECTION,11839;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,427;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3745;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6752;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,10211;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,11235;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,12548;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,427;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3745;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6752;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,10211;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,11235;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,12548;LEADER,436;LEADER,1779;LEADER,4582;LEADER,7178;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,436;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1779;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,4582;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,7178;",Osage Beach;Capitol Hill;South Dakota;Jefferson City;Blue Springs;Dearborn;Missourians;Washington;Neosho;Kentucky;Missouri;China
432,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/democrats-abortion-issue-midterms/,"After abortion rights advocates prevailed decisively on a Kansas ballot measure this week, Democrats are putting the issue right at the center of their attacks against newly minted Republican nominees in key midterm races.  In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly hit the airwaves this week with an ad criticizing Blake Masters, who won Tuesday’s Republican primary, for his “dangerous ideas on abortion.” Similarly, Senate Majority PAC, a group with ties to Senate Democratic leadership, began airing an ad highlighting Masters’ “extreme” abortion views.  In Michigan, a group aligned with the Democratic Governors Association launched an ad against Tudor Dixon shortly after she won the Republican gubernatorial nomination Tuesday featuring clips of her saying she does not support abortion ban exemptions in cases of rape or incest.  That Democrats are choosing to kick off their general election campaigns in critical states with paid messaging focused entirely on abortion shows that the party sees the issue as its best hand to play in a political environment that has otherwise been largely unfavorable.  Democrats were already confident the issue would become more salient – and work to their benefit – in the November elections after the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in June.  But they became even more emboldened this week. Voters in the red state of Kansas rejected a ballot measure that would have removed abortion protections from the state’s constitution by 18 points. The margin and the level of turnout surprised members of both parties. As CNN’s Harry Enten noted, there were more than 900,000 votes counted for the amendment, compared to less than 750,000 for the state’s gubernatorial primaries. All told, turnout was up nearly 60% for Kansas’ primaries this year compared to 2018.   While that is all promising for the Democrats, their challenge going forward will be channeling the energy of abortion rights proponents for elections, like those in Arizona or Michigan, that aren’t straight up-or-down votes on the issue. (Though notably, there will likely be a measure on the November ballot in Michigan to enshrine abortion rights into the state’s constitution.)  Polls have shown that clear majorities oppose the court’s Roe v. Wade decision and that abortion is rising up the public’s priority list. But the issue has still not surpassed the economy and inflation as the top concern, and Democrats are still fighting the headwinds presented by President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings.  The Point: At the very least, the abortion issue can help Democrats maximize turnout among their base this fall. To avoid the midterm blowouts the president’s party has faced in recent cycles, Democrats will need it to become a stronger motivational force for swing voters too.",Harry Enten;Blake Masters;Tudor Dixon;Mark Kelly;Joe Biden,Supreme Court;Democratic Governors Association;Senate Majority;Senate Democratic;Cnn,"BAN,797;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,922;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1054;ECON_INFLATION,2393;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2393;WB_442_INFLATION,2393;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEES,202;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,65;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1406;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,102;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,852;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1123;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1868;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2426;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,102;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,852;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1123;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1868;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2426;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2247;LEADER,616;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNORS,616;USPEC_POLICY1,2381;EPU_ECONOMY,2381;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2381;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,193;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,359;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,700;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2412;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2482;ELECTION,900;RAPE,825;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,825;CONSTITUTIONAL,1505;CONSTITUTIONAL,2199;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSA,1784;",Arizona;Kansas;Michigan
173,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/hanover-virginia-school-logo-swastika/,"A Virginia school district has apologized for distributing T-shirts with a logo resembling a swastika during a professional learning conference. During the conference held for staff this week, Hanover County Public Schools distributed T-shirts and conference materials containing the logo, which the district says had been designed by one of its teachers. The logo was intended “to represent four hands and arms grasping together – a symbol of unity for our all-county professional learning conference. Nothing more,” Michael Gill, superintendent of the district situated north of Richmond, said in an online message. “We are deeply sorry for this mistake and for the emotions that the logo has evoked by its semblance to a swastika and, by extension, to the atrocities that were committed under its banner,” Gill said. “Unquestionably, we condemn anything associated with the Nazi regime in the strongest manner possible.”  Gill said the apology comes after concerns about the logo were raised, and that the district understands that the logo “has deeply upset members of our staff and community who see the logo as resembling a swastika.” Photos of the shirt were posted on the Hanover County Schools Facebook page, according to CNN affiliate WTVR, but have since been removed.  The images circulated widely on social media and were reposted by Rachel Levy, a public school advocate, parent and Virginia House of Delegates candidate running in 2023. Last month, an elementary school in Georgia redesigned their school’s logo for a second time after parents pointed out its resemblance to a swastika.  Daniel Staffenberg, chief executive of the Jewish Community Federation of Richmond, said he appreciated the school system’s quick response.   “In partnership with the school board, we will continue to address this incident and ensure that Jewish students, families, and all vulnerable minorities unsettled by this logo are represented in the cities and school systems they inhabit,” he said in an online statement.  The group and its partners reached out to Gill by letter and plan on scheduling a meeting to discuss next steps in making sure “the voice of Jewish students and those of other minority faiths are heard and respected.”  The district serves about 17,000 students, who are on summer break and are scheduled to resume classes September 6.",Daniel Staffenberg;Michael Gill,Jewish Community Federation Of Richmond;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,1482;EDUCATION,22;EDUCATION,1424;EDUCATION,1533;EDUCATION,1568;EDUCATION,1782;EDUCATION,1844;EDUCATION,2027;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,22;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1424;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1533;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1568;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1782;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1844;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2027;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,22;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1424;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1533;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1568;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1782;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1844;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2027;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1687;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1376;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1376;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1376;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SUPERINTENDENT,559;TAX_FNCACT_SUPERINTENDENT,559;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,1924;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,2236;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,2337;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,244;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,1252;EXTREMISM,909;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1406;SELF_IDENTIFIED_ATROCITY,797;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1261;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,1677;TAX_RELIGION_JEWISH,1701;TAX_RELIGION_JEWISH,1915;TAX_RELIGION_JEWISH,2227;TAX_ETHNICITY_JEWISH,1701;TAX_ETHNICITY_JEWISH,1915;TAX_ETHNICITY_JEWISH,2227;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,916;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_EXECUTIVE,1687;REL_ANTISEMITISM,105;REL_ANTISEMITISM,760;REL_ANTISEMITISM,1161;REL_ANTISEMITISM,1647;SOC_EXPRESSREGRET,46;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,1376;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,1376;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,1376;WB_2141_EDUCATION_DISTRICTS,31;WB_1502_EDUCATIONAL_DECENTRALIZATION,31;WB_470_EDUCATION,31;WB_1497_EDUCATION_MANAGEMENT_AND_ADMINISTRATION,31;",Georgia;Hanover County;Richmond;Virginia
