said O
in O
late O
July O
that O
about O
20% O
to O
25% O
of O
patients O
there O
have O
met O
the O
criteria O
for O
Tpoxx. O
As O
of O
July O
23, O
the O
treatment O
had O
been O
prescribed O
for O
about O
215 O
out O
of O
839 O
confirmed O
cases. O

Anecdotally O
, O
of O
the O
providers O
that O
we’ve O
spoken O
to O
, O
we’ve O
seen O
, O
very O
commonly O
, O
significant O
improvements O
within O
just O
a O
few O
days O
of O
starting O
and O
improvements O
in O
pain O
. O
And O
very O
significantly O
, O
we O
have O
not O
seen O
any O
significant O
adverse O
events O
reported O
and O
very O
few O
even O
mild O
adverse O
events O
. O

Some O
headaches O
, O
nausea O
. O

But O
that’s O
pretty O
much O
it,” O
Foote B-PER
said. O
However, O
it’s O
unclear O
what O
proportion O
of O
the O
more O
than O
5,000 O
probable O
or O
confirmed O
cases O
nationwide O
have O
been O
treated O
with O

CDC B-ORG
officials O
said O
in O
a O

that O
more O
than O
223 O
people O
had O
been O
treated O
as O
of O
July O
22, O
but O
the O
agency O
did O
not O
respond O
to O
requests O
for O
a O
more O
specific O
number. O

Experts O
say O
the O
number O
who’ve O
been O

probably O
a O
fraction O

after O

five O

Kwong B-PER

his O

even O
then O
, O
he O
says O
, O
they O
didn’t O
know O
how O
to O
treat O
him O

sent O
him O
home O

But O
his O
symptoms O
only O
got O
worse O
, O

he O
went O
back O

being O
advised O
to O
go O

it O
was O
treating O

Exhausted O

frustrated O
, O
he O
agreed O
out O

He O
got O
there O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
; O
several O
hours O
later O
, O
he O
met O
Chin-Hong B-PER

took O
his O
first O

“ O
He O
had O
to O
push O

go O
to O
the O
emergency O

“ O
If O

he O
would O
have O
never O
gotten O
Tpoxx O

To O
get O
Tpoxx O
, O
a O
patient O
must O
sign O
a O

from O
the O

doctors O
must O
request O

their O
local O

which O
involves O

The O
CDC B-ORG

the O

recently O
reduced O
the O

allowed O

“ O
They O
have O
made O
it O
easier O

it O
still O

there’s O
a O
high O
“activation O

some O

require O
additional O

As O
a O
result O

Tpoxx O
has O
been O
disproportionately O
used O

“We O

trials O
would O
not O
only O

much-needed O
data O
on O
how O
to O
use O
Tpoxx O
, O
they O
would O
help O
expand O
access O
in O
two O
ways O
. O
First O
, O
clinical O
data O
could O
help O
the O
drug O
qualify O
for O
a O
different O
type O
of O
regulatory O
approval O
that O
allows O
broader O
access O
with O
fewer O
hurdles O
. O
Second O
, O
trials O
could O
help O
ease O
access O

for O
people O
who O
don’t O
qualify O
under O
the O
current O
Expanded O
Access O
protocol O
, O
such O
as O
those O
with O
milder O
disease O
. O
“Historically O
, O
antivirals O
are O
better O
earlier O
than O
later O
, O

we O
have O
to O
prove O
it O

that O
there O

challenges O
of O
limited O
access O
and O
clinical O
data O
to O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
parallel O
is O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
is O
behind O
the O
UK B-LOC

Europe B-LOC
in O
running O
these O
trials O

continue O

her O

“ O
Until O

“the O

It’s O
a O
make-or-break O
week O
for O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden’s I-PER
agenda O
. O
The O
deal O
on O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
that O
Senate O
Majority O
Leader O
Chuck B-PER
Schumer I-PER
and O
Sen. O
Joe B-PER
Manchin I-PER
announced O
last O

narrow O
window O
to O
navigate O
both O
chambers O
of O
Congress O
and O
land O
on O
the O
President’s O
desk O
before O
August O
recess O
. O
And O
with O
the O
shock O
of O
the O
deal’s O
announcement O
wearing O
off O
, O
GOP B-ORG
opposition O
, O
public O
scrutiny O
, O
and O
Democrats’ O
slim O
majorities O
will O
all O
have O
a O
say O
in O
whether O
the O
legislation O
is O
a O
breakthrough O
or O
a O
bust O
. O
Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill? O
The O
agreement O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ O
goals, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years: O
What’s O
not O
in O
the O
bill? O
To O
be O
clear, O
this O
isn’t O
Build O
Back O
Better O
2.0. O
The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
key O
Democratic O
priorities O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
left O
out, O
including: O
What O
are O
Republicans O
saying? O
The O
package, O
as O
it O
stands, O
is O
facing O
furious O
GOP O
opposition. O
Republican O
lawmakers O
on O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Finance I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
released O
data O
from O
the O
nonpartisan O
Joint B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on I-ORG
Taxation I-ORG
that O
showed O
that O
Americans O
of O
all O
incomes O
would O
see O
their O
federal O
taxes O
rise O
under O
the O
climate O
and O
health O
care O
package. O
That O
analysis, O
however, O
looked O
at O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
the O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
provision O
on O
corporations. O
Economists O
assume O
companies O
would O
then O
pass O
along O
part O
of O
their O
tax O
increase O
to O
employees O
by O
reducing O
their O
after-tax O
wages O
and O
job O
opportunities. O
Also, O
shareholders O
would O
take O
a O
hit O
since O
the O
value O
of O
their O
stock O
holdings, O
including O
those O
held O
in O
pensions O
and O
mutual O
funds, O
would O
likely O
decline. O

What’s O
Biden B-PER
saying? O
The O
President O
has O
urged O
congressional O
Democrats O
to O
quickly O
pass O
the O
surprise O
agreement O
“for O
America.” B-LOC
“This O
bill O
is O
far O
from O
perfect. O
It’s O
a O
compromise. O

But O
it’s O
often O
how O
progress O
is O
made O
, O
by O
compromises O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
that O
my O
message O
to O
Congress O
is O
this: O
This O
is O
the O
strongest O
bill O
you O
can O
pass O
to O
lower O
inflation O
, O
cut O
the O
deficit O
, O
reduce O
health O
care O
costs O
, O
tackle O
the O
climate O
crises O
and O
promote O
energy O
security O
– O
all O
the O
time O
while O
reducing O
the O
burdens O
facing O
working-class O
and O
middle-class O
families O
, O
” O
Biden B-PER
said O
during O
a O
speech O
at O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
the O
day O
after O
the O
deal O
was O
announced O
. O
What’s O
the O
timeline? O
The O
health O
and O
climate O
bill O
stands O
a O
serious O
chance O
of O
becoming O
law O
as O
soon O
as O
August O
, O
assuming O
it O
passes O
muster O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian O
to O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
approved O
along O
straight O
party O
lines O
in O
the O
budget O
process O
– O
and O
all O
Democrats B-ORG
vote O
for O
it O
( O
more O
on O
that O
below O
) O
– O
and O
that O
the O
House B-ORG
passes O
it O
. O
Democrats B-ORG
need O
all O
50 O
of O
their O
senators O
to O
be O
present O
and O
vote O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
Vice O
President O
Kamala B-PER
Harris I-PER
casting O
the O
tie-breaking O
vote O
, O
as O
all O
Republicans B-ORG
are O
expected O
to O
vote O
against O
the O
deal O
. O
Manchin B-PER
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Jake B-PER
Tapper I-PER
on O
“State O
of O
the O
Union” O
Sunday O
he O
hopes O
the O
legislation O
passes O
before O
the O
August O
recess O
. O
“I O
think O
it’s O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
legislation O
and O
on O
normal O
times O
, O
my O
Republican O
colleagues O
would O
be O
for O
something O
such O
as O
this. O

We’ve O
basically O
paid O
down O
debt O
, O
(which) O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O

We’ve O
accelerated O
permitting O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O
And O
we’ve O
increased O
production O
of O
energy O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O
We’ve O
done O
things O
that O
we O
should O
be O
doing O
together O
, O

the O

previously O
raised O
concerns O
about O

which O
would O
raise O
$14 O

Sinema B-PER

not O

Asked O
about O
getting O
the O
support O
of O
his O
Arizona B-LOC
colleague O
, O
Manchin B-PER
said O
on O
Sunday O
, O
“ O
We O
work O
very O
close O
together O
on O
so O
many O
things O
, O
and O
she O
has O
so O
much O
in O
this O
piece O
of O
legislation O
. O
She’s O
formed O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
and O
worked O
on O
it O
very O
hard O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
that O
basically O
when O
she O
looks O
at O
the O
bill O
and O
sees O
the O
whole O
spectrum O
of O
what O
we’re O
doing O
… O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
positive O
about O
it O

she’ll O
make O
her O
decision O

I O
respect O
that O

Let’s O
put O

January O

an O
act O
of O
“ O
domestic O
terrorism O

as O
FBI B-ORG
Director O
Christopher B-PER
Wray I-PER
testified O
before O

Just O
as O
we O

the O

deadlier O
September B-LOC

“ O

– O
we O
would O
do O
the O
same O
for O
anyone O
who O
played O
a O

on O
January O
6 O
. O

For O
some O
people O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
calling O
a O
white O

a O

is O
uncomfortable O
, O
but O
there’s O
no O
place O

The O

majority O
of O

connection O
with O
the O
January O
6 O
attack O
have O
been O
granted O
bail O
, O
according O
to O
PolitiFact B-ORG
. O
Those O
defendants O
still O
in O

deserve O
to O
be O
there O
because O
of O
the O
severity O
of O

with O
which O

Among O
them O
are O

– O
some O

Imagine O
if O

about O
18 O
months O
after O
a O

a O

what O

ET) O
Sunday O
appeared O
to O
be O
holding O
almost O
24 O
hours O
later. O
The O
conflict O
led O
to O
the O
death O
of O
at O
least O
44 O
militants O
and O
civilians O
in O
Gaza, B-LOC
according O
to O
information O

Palestinian B-ORG

Fifteen O
of O
the O
dead O
were O
children O
. O
Israel B-LOC
insists O
most O
of O
those O
killed O
were O
militants O
, O
and O
that O
several O
civilians O
were O
killed O
by O
failed O
militant O
rocket O
launches O
. O
Hamas B-ORG
, O
the O
militant O
group O
that O
runs O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
expressed O
support O
for O
the O
PIJ’s O
actions O
. O
But O
it O
kept O
its O
much O
larger O
and O
more O
powerful O
arsenal O
of O
rockets O
out O
of O
the O
equation O
, O
while O
Israel’s B-LOC
military O
made O
it O
clear O
from O
the O
outset O
they O
were O
focusing O
solely O
on O
PIJ O
targets O
. O
That O
kept O
the O
conflict O
from O
spiraling O
into O
a O
larger O
, O
more O
dangerous O
confrontation O
, O
and O
closer O
to O
what O
happened O
during O
the O
11-day O
war O
in O
May O
2021 O
. O
So O
why O
not O
get O
involved O
? O
According O
to O
analysts O
and O
Israeli B-LOC
officials O
, O
one O
reason O
is O
the O
fact O
it O
is O
still O
only O
15 O
months O
since O
the O
2021 O
conflict O
that O
led O
to O
considerable O
damage O
and O
death O
in O
Gaza B-LOC
. O
Palestinians O
there O
are O
still O
rebuilding O
their O
homes O
, O
and O
Hamas B-ORG
is O
rebuilding O
its O
arsenal O
. O
The O
Israeli B-LOC
government O
also O
believes O
its O
campaign O
of O
economic O
incentives O
– O
boosting O
the O
number O
of O
permits O
given O
to O
Gazans O
to O
cross O
into O
Israel B-LOC
for O
work O
– O
is O
succeeding O
. O
Israel B-LOC
and O
Egypt B-LOC
have O
imposed O
a O
closure O
on O
Gaza B-LOC
since O
2007 O
, O
limiting O
access O
to O
the O
territory O
via O
land O
, O
air O
and O
sea O
, O
including O
tight O
restrictions O
on O
the O
movement O
of O
residents O
and O
the O
flow O
of O
goods O
. O
If O
rockets O
are O
fired O
, O
Israel B-LOC
closes O
the O
border O
and O
the O
thousands O
of O
Gazans O
with O
permits O
can’t O
work O
in O
Israel B-LOC
or O
get O
paid O
. O
On O
Monday O
, O
a O
senior O
Israeli B-LOC
diplomatic O
official O
said O
Hamas B-ORG
was O
“ O

The O
conflict O
also O
brought O
about O
another O
breakthrough O
, O
albeit O
on O
a O
somewhat O
smaller O
scale O
: O
former O

now O

Netanyahu I-PER
met O
with O
Lapid B-PER
on O
Sunday O

It O

in O
California B-LOC
history O
, O
a O

Researchers O
found O
that O
over O

, O
nearly O
half O
of O
the O

had O
been O
dry O
— O
there O
was O
no O

Dry O

like O
the O
one O
California B-LOC

The O
air O
is O
so O
dry O
that O
the O

evaporates O
before O
it O
hits O
the O

And O
the O

The O
August O
Complex O
Fire O
was O
originally O
more O
than O
three O
dozen O
fires O
that O
were O
sparked O
by O
dry O

. O

Those O
fires O
merged O
to O
become O
the O
largest O
in O

, O
burning O
more O
than O
a O
million O
acres O
in O
seven O

. O

California B-LOC
firefighters O
were O
exhausted O
that O
summer O
, O
CNN B-ORG
reported O
at O
the O
time O

they O
were O
particularly O
concerned O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
more O
and O
more O
fires O
sparked O
by O
dry O
lightning O
. O
All O
of O
the O
seven O
largest O
fires O
in O
California B-LOC
history O
have O
occurred O
in O
the O
past O
five O
years O

four O
of O
those O
were O
caused O

“ O
With O

“ O
So O
even O
if O

dry O

, O
it O
just O
takes O
one O

an O
area O

is O
a O
significant O

Dry O

was O
found O
to O
occur O
most O
frequently O
in O
July B-LOC

August B-LOC
, O
the O
researchers O
found O
, O
though O
lower O

tended O
to O
see O
activity O
peak O
later O
in O
September B-LOC

October B-LOC
, O
when O

Researchers O

that O

Sacramento B-LOC

San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
, O
Redwood B-LOC
, O
Sequoia B-LOC

Yosemite B-LOC
, O

30% O

50% O

“ O
That O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fires O
started O
by O

, O
which O
are O
usually O
more O
difficult O

Vagasky B-PER
, O
who O

not O

the O
findings O
provide O
“ O
excellent O

the O

This O
really O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O
understanding O
when O
dry O

can O
be O
expected O
so O
that O
crews O
can O
be O
at O

  O
The O

just O
the O

Vagasky B-PER

“ O
When O

they O

Kalashnikov B-PER

there O
are O
still O
uncertainties O
when O
it O
comes O

whether O
dry O

will O
occur O
more O
often O
as O
the O

But O
one O
thing O
is O
certain O
, O
he O
said O
, O
as O
the O
Western B-LOC
drought O
persists O
, O
conditions O
are O
much O
more O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
take O
shape O
. O
In O
just O
the O
last O
year O
alone O
, O
dry O
lightning O
has O
sparked O
deadly O
and O
destructive O
wildfires O
such O
as O
the O
Bootleg O

in O
Oregon B-LOC
that O
burned O
more O

400,000 O

“ O
We O

— O
California B-LOC
is O

Kalashnikov B-PER
said O

“ O
So O
we O
can O
say O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
trend O
in O
lightning O
is O
doing O
, O
when O
lightning O
happens O
with O
a O
hotter O

drier O
atmosphere O

, O
it’s O
just O
going O
to O
lead O

more O

“ O
I O

there O

once O
I O
saw O
smoke O
rising O
from O

I O
just O
panicked.” O
The O

another O
new O
worry: O
The O

More O
immediately O

the O

could O
also O
be O
the O
curtain O

what O
may O

critical O
legal O

over O
the O
extent O

which O

assert O

Such O
a O

could O
go O
all O

the O
Supreme B-ORG

break O

the O

more O
broadly O

the O

there O

the O

Some O

, O
protectionism O

“Sub-Saharan B-LOC

Monkeypox O
is O
a O
poxvirus O

it O
generally O

pimple- O

flu-like O
symptoms O

according O
to O
the O

The O
lesions O
typically O
concentrate O
on O
the O
arms O

in O
the O

outbreak O
, O
they’re O
showing O
up O
more O
frequently O
on O
the O
genital O

perianal O
area O

which O
has O
raised O
some O
concerns O
that O
monkeypox O
lesions O
may O
be O
confused O
with O
STDs O

“ O
I O
had O
between O
600 O

800 O
lesions O

up O

be O
able O

target O

“ O
over O

While O
Zawahiri B-PER

unable O
to O
reconstitute O
al O

after O
the O
death O
of O
bin O

to O
its O
former O
power O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
death O
stand O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
other O
terrorist O
groups O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC

elsewhere O
. O
However O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
apparently O
killed O
in O
an O
attack O
on O
a O
house O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Kabul B-LOC
raises O
real O
concerns O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
– O
back O
under O
Taliban B-ORG
control O
– O
is O
yet O
again O
harboring O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
. O
But O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
has O
intelligence O
capabilities O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
despite O
the O
exit O
of O
US B-ORG
diplomats O
, O
military O
and O
intelligence O
officials O
from O
the O
country O
last O
year O
. O

Biden B-PER
chose O
the O
more O
optimistic O
takeaway O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
operation O
proved O
his O
promise O
that O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
Afghanistan B-LOC
to O
again O
become O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
terrorists O
. O
Presidents O
typically O
don’t O
take O
life-and-death O
decisions O
about O
national O
security O
to O
massage O
their O
own O
approval O
ratings O
– O
at O
least O
most O
of O
them O
don’t O
. O
But O
they O
all O
operate O
in O
a O
political O
context O
because O
of O
their O
position O
. O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
Biden B-PER
could O
benefit O
incrementally O
from O
his O
commander-in-chief O
moment O
on O
television O
, O
reporting O
from O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
to O
Americans O
about O
the O
killing O
of O
an O
enemy O
. O
The O
drone O
strike O
in O
Kabul B-LOC
came O
as O
Biden B-PER
was O
being O
assailed O
by O
Republicans B-ORG
as O
weak O
and O
incapable O
. O
During O
the O
US B-ORG
departure O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
Biden’s B-PER
reputation O
as O
a O
safe O
pair O
of O
hands O
on O
foreign O
policy O
took O
a O
hit O
as O
Americans O
watched O
scenes O
of O
desperate O
refugees O
falling O
to O
their O
deaths O
from O
departing O
US B-ORG
planes O
, O
and O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
admitted O
to O
a O
botched O
drone O
strike O
that O
killed O
10 O
Afghan O
civilians O
– O
including O
seven O
children O
. O
But O
it’s O
also O
unlikely O
that O
Monday’s O
news O
will O
do O
much O
to O
alter O
the O
fate O
of O
Democrats B-ORG
in O
November’s O
midterm O

, O
who O
fear O
heavy O
losses O
amid O
new O
signs O
the O
economy O
could O
plunge O
into O
recession O
and O
following O
months O
of O
punishing O
high O
inflation O
. O
Foreign O
policy O
victories O
can O
be O
fleeting O
, O
and O
decapitating O
terror O
groups O
no O
longer O
brings O
the O
political O
payoff O
that O
it O
did O
when O
then-President O
George B-PER
W I-PER
. O

Bush O
was O
keeping O
score O
in O
the O
years O
after O
9/11 O
. O
It O
may O
take O
a O
few O
days O
to O
fully O
assess O
how O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
located O
and O
to O
confirm O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
versions O
of O
events O
. O

On O
occasion O
, O
administrations O
have O
gotten O
details O
wrong O
or O
out O
of O
context O
in O
early O
readouts O
. O
Biden B-PER
’s O
assurance O
that O
no O
civilians O
were O
killed O
in O
the O
drone O
strike O
could O
not O
immediately O
be O
confirmed O
. O
In O
an O
increasingly O
polarized O
nation O
, O
the O
killing O
could O
offer O
a O
rare O
moment O
of O
unity O
– O
even O
if O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
9/11 O
attacks O
and O
the O
relatively O
low O
profile O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
didn’t O
send O
crowds O
to O
chant O
outside O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
as O
was O
the O
case O
when O
bin O

was O
killed O
. O
Still O
, O
any O
satisfaction O
over O
the O
killing O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
is O
likely O
to O
be O
soon O
overtaken O
by O
a O
more O
multilayered O
and O
urgent O
US B-ORG
conundrum O
abroad O
– O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
standoff O
over O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
threatens O
to O
erupt O
even O
as O
the O
US B-ORG

an O

proxy O
war O
against O
Russia B-LOC
in O
Ukraine B-LOC

US B-ORG

Some O

fear O

know O
only O

that O
when O

the O

his O
passion O
for O

feels O
even O
more O
salient O
today O
. O
Gun O
control O
legislation O
remains O
minimal O
at O
the O
federal O
level O
, O
though O
, O
crucially O
, O
just O
last O

, O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
signed O
into O
law O
the O
Bipartisan O
Safer O
Communities O
Act O
, O
the O
first O
significant O
federal O
gun O
safety O
legislation O
passed O
in O
nearly O
30 O
years O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
some O
Democratic-controlled O
state O
legislatures O
are O
designing O
laws O
to O
confront O
the O
recent O
spike O
in O
gun O
violence O
. O

However O
, O
some O
observers O
worry O
about O
the O
potential O
unintended O
consequences O
of O
such O
laws O
, O
which O
have O
at O
times O
in O
the O
past O
contributed O
to O
mass O
incarceration O

disproportionately O
harmed O
Black O
Americans O
. O
“ O
There’s O
definitely O
a O
tension O
between O
our O
biased O
criminal O
legal O
system O
and O
some O
of O
the O
sentencing-focused O
policies O
we’ve O
seen O
implemented O
over O
the O
years O
, O
Jackson B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O
That’s O
why O
we’re O
pushing O
for O
a O
public-health O
response O
to O
gun O
violence O
, O
which O
means O
that O
it O
should O
be O
people O
centered O
and O
resource O
driven O
, O
not O
necessarily O
about O
carceral O
strategies O
or O
restrictive O
policies O
. O
In O
short O
, O
he O
wants O

to O
play O
a O
smaller O
role O
in O

. O
Jackson B-PER
added O
that O
he O
has O
little O
interest O

directing O
resentment O
toward O
the O
man O
who O
shot O
him O

What O
I O
have O
more O
resentment O
for O
is O
, O
How O
did O
that O
individual O
gain O
access O
to O
the O

? O
Why O
is O
it O
so O
easy O
for O
people O
in O
my O
community O
to O
get O
a O
gun O
? O
It’s O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
gun O
in O
my O
neighborhood O
than O
it O
is O
to O
get O
a O
library O
book O
or O
a O
healthy O
meal O
, O
Jackson B-PER
said O
. O
There’s O
no O
easy O
way O
to O
curb O
gun O
violence O
. O
But O
experts O
say O
that O
“cleaning O
up O
policing” O
and O
shrinking O
our O
reliance O

the O
criminal O

system O
are O
important O
pieces O

‘We’ve O

The O

echoed O
some O
of O
Kaishian’s O
sentiments O
. O
“ O
What O
we’re O
seeing O
is O
an O
influx O
of O

cases O

these O

are O
happening O
in O
very O

, O
Mitchell B-PER
told O

stressing O
that O
“ O
the O
reality O

the O

is O
the O
way O
we’re O
pursuing O

that O
haven’t O
affected O
the O

demand O
for O

. O
” O
He O
also O
noted O
that O
his O
view O
puts O
him O
in O
an O
uncomfortable O
position O
, O
because O
he’s O
“ O
not O
a O

person O
” O
and O
doesn’t O
own O
a O

. O
Like O
Anderson B-PER

Kaishian B-PER
, O
Mitchell B-PER
pointed O
out O
the O
challenge O
that O

can O
pose O
. O
“ O
What O
we’re O
seeing O
is O
the O
police O
saying O
, O
Listen O
, O
if O
we O
can’t O
stop O
gun O
violence O
, O
then O
we O
just O
need O
to O
arrest O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
and O
hope O
that O
that O
has O
some O
type O
of O
effect O

” O
Mitchell B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Also O
, O
there O
are O
PR O
benefits O
to O
being O
able O
to O
say O
, O
We O
pulled O
14,000 O
guns O
off O

Black O
Americans O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
manufacturers O

enjoy O
such O
broad O

? O
For O
starters O
, O
we O
must O
recognize O
that O
while O
even O
well-intentioned O

can O
disproportionately O
harm O
Black O

, O
there’s O
a O
flip O

“ O
It’s O
important O
to O
keep O
in O

twice O
about O
so O
freely O
using O

commit O
a O

Much O
evidence O
shows O
that O

doesn’t O
actually O
stop O
crime O

and O
that O
failing O
to O

a O
cost O
. O
Scotching O
false O
narratives O
matters O
, O
too O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
Republican O
lawmakers O
often O
attempt O
to O
paint O
Democratic-controlled O
states O
as O
hellscapes O
uniquely O
afflicted O
by O

the O

GOP B-ORG

“ O

Further O
, O
we O
can O
learn O
something O

the O

“ O
The O
1994 O

one O

was O
that O
there O

One O
of O
the O
things O

you O

that O

There’s O
even O
an O
attempt O

try O
to O
come O
up O
with O
solutions O
that O
don’t O
get O
the O
criminal O

at O
all O

He O
said O
that O
extreme O
risk O
protection O
orders O

are O

A O
worried O

If O

the O
order O

completely O
civil O

Community O

another O

These O

make O
a O
big O

are O
getting O

It’s O
this O
tactical O

that O
the O

But O
she O

expressed O
concerns O

other O
tax O
provisions O
as O
well O
– O
namely O
on O
raising O
taxes O
on O
so-called O

Sinema B-PER
has O
relayed O
to O
top O
Democrats B-ORG
that O
she O
wants O
that O
provision O
out O
of O
the O

according O
to O
a O

familiar O
with O
the O

Sinema B-PER
, O
the O
lone O

among O

and O
who O
was O
blindsided O
by O

has O
refused O
to O
tip O
her O
hand O
one O
way O

the O
other O
on O
the O

– O
giving O
conservative O
critics O
of O
the O

reason O
to O
believe O
they O
could O
convince O
her O
to O
change O
her O
mind O
. O
Democrats B-ORG
are O
still O
confident O
that O
they O
can O
win O
her O
over O

also O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
may O
have O
to O
make O
some O
changes O
– O
particularly O
over O
the O
tax O
provisions O
– O
to O
get O
her O
to O
“yes O

But O
as O
she O
’s O
been O
in O
talks O
with O
Democrats B-ORG
who O
have O
touted O
the O

benefits O
, O
Republicans B-ORG

her O

I O
think O
as O
most O

you O

pretty O
independent O

that O
she O

get O
from O

So O
you O
know O
, O
I O
think O
she’s O
going O
through O
that O
process O
right O
now O
. O
At O
a O

conference O
on O
Wednesday O

where O
Republican O

“ O
We O

making O
this O

On O
Wednesday O
, O
Sinema B-PER
indicated O
to O
CNN B-ORG
that O
she O
was O
in O
no O

her O
position O
on O
the O

“ O
Taking O
my O

she O

Her O

reiterated O
that O

waiting O
for O
the O

by O
the O

parliamentarian O

completed O
before O
announcing O

But O
last O
fall O
, O
Sinema B-PER
indicated O
her O
support O
for O
a O
corporate O
minimum O
tax O
, O
saying O
at O
the O
time O
that O
it’s O
a O
“ O

proposal O
to O
ensure O
that O
“ O
highly O
profitable O

pay O
their O

The O
proposal O
was O
developed O

In O

, O
Seiden B-PER
expressed O
the O
business O
community’s O
opposition O
to O
the O
15% O
tax O
provision O
, O
noting O
it O
would O
particularly O
hit O
manufacturers O
that O
take O
advantage O
of O
an O
accelerated O

deduction O
that O
lowers O
their O

asked O

more O
information O
on O
how O
the O

asked O
that O
question O

which O
gave O
him O
hope O
that O
she O

be O
open O

somehow O
amending O

It O
was O
a O

collecting O

On O

Dick B-PER

the O

“ O
We O

we O

so O
I O
hope O

be O
with O
us O

” O
While O
Democrats O
say O
the O
bill O
would O
ensure O
large O
corporations O
don’t O
avoid O
paying O
taxes O
, O
instilling O
“ O
fairness O
” O
into O
the O
tax O
code O
, O
the O
Arizona B-LOC
Chamber I-ORG
president O
argued O
that O
a O
minimum O
corporate O
tax O
makes O
the O
code O
“ O
overly O
complicated O
.” O
Seiden B-PER
said O
that O
raising O
taxes O
during O
a O
recession O
is O
particularly O
unpopular O
and O
would O
inject O
more O
uncertainty O
into O
the O
marketplace O

“ O
The O
meeting O
went O
great O

her O
work O
on O
the O

the O

but O
said O
the O
“ O
the O
celebration O
of O

is O
short-lived O
” O
if O
some O
of O
the O

Seiden B-PER
said O
he O
would O
like O
to O
see O
some O
of O
the O
energy O
and O
environmental O
pieces O
go O
through O
without O
the O
“poison O

tax O
provisions, O
acknowledging O
that O
some O
elements O
of O
the O
energy O
sector O
support O
provisions O
like O
the O

for O

In O

the O
Arizona B-LOC

“I O

“You O

that O

Sinema B-PER
said. O
“That O
was O
true O
yesterday O
and O
it O
is O
true O
today.” O
Sinema B-PER
already O
has O
effectively O
pushed O
back O

rates O
in O
President O

back O
the O

a O

“I O

John B-PER
LaBombard, I-PER
a O

that O

looking O
for O
“good, O
effective O

that O

For O

the O

had O
a O

is O
hard O
to O

When O

he O
had O
already O
been O
anointed O
by O

it O
still O
took O
some O
time O

the O
“bayat” O
– O
the O
oath O

loyalty O
– O
of O
far-flung O
members O

The O
working O
assumption O

is O
that O

over O
the O
next O
few O

begin O
to O

the O
field O

But O
the O

aren’t O
typically O
forthcoming O
about O
the O
companies O
that O
make O

And O
manufacturers O
, O
likewise O
, O
have O
little O
incentive O

reveal O
that O
they’re O
creating O
similar O
products O
to O
their O
name O

a O

Many O
leading O
national O
brand O
manufacturers O
create O
private O
labels O
for O
multiple O
retailers O
. O
In O
the O
late O
1990s O
more O
than O
half O
of O
brand O
manufacturers O
were O
estimated O
to O
make O
private O
goods O
as O
well O
. O
Although O
store O
brands O
ostensibly O
compete O
with O
manufacturers’ O
national O
brands O
, O
manufacturers O
often O
have O
excess O
capacity O
on O
their O
production O
lines O
. O
To O
generate O
additional O
profit O
, O
some O
will O
use O
that O
extra O
capacity O
to O
make O
private O
labels O
. O
Other O
brand O
manufacturers O
will O
produce O
private O
labels O
as O
an O
incentive O
for O
retailers O
, O
hoping O
they’ll O
be O
rewarded O
with O
better O
shelf O
space O

placement O
for O
their O

the O

flooded O
the O

with O

extolling O
the O
advantages O
of O
their O
products O
. O

Most O
customers O
were O
fiercely O
loyal O
to O
specific O
brands O
, O
not O
retailers O
. O
A O
store O
that O
didn’t O
carry O
major O
labels O
would O
likely O
get O
crushed O
, O
which O
gave O
manufacturers O
immense O

Additionally O
, O
many O

considered O
dull O

cheap O
knockoffs O
of O

The O
low O
point O
of O
private O
label O
came O
during O
the O
1970s O
, O
Durham B-PER
said O
, O
when O
stores O
seeking O
to O
cut O
costs O
and O
rolled O
out O
generics O
with O
basic O
white O
backgrounds O
and O
black O
letters O

Retailers O
make O
private O
label O
brands O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
, O
including O
to O
boost O
profitability O
and O
sometimes O
as O
a O
negotiating O
tool O
against O
brands O
. O
Private O
brands O
often O
carry O
profit O
margins O
that O
are O
20% O
to O
40% O
higher O
than O
national O
brands O
because O
stores O
don’t O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
advertising O
, O
distribution O
or O
other O
markup O
costs O
that O
are O
embedded O
in O
major O
brands’ O
prices O
. O
In O
the O
mid-20th O
century O
, O
many O
retailers O
started O
to O
develop O
their O
own O
labels O
to O
claw O
back O

power O

keep O
their O

As O

consolidated O
in O

the O

Now O

armed O
while O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
were O
. O
“ O
To O
give O
you O
a O
life O
sentence O
would O
be O
to O
not O
distinguish O
you O
at O
all O
from O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
Bryan B-PER
still O
deserved O
a O
long O
sentence O
. O
She O
noted O
he O
would O
be O
90 O
when O
his O
federal O
sentence O
ends O
. O
The O
sentencing O
of O
both O
McMichaels B-PER
were O
preceded O
by O
emotional O
testimony O
from O
Arbery’s B-PER
family O
, O
which O
told O
the O
court O
about O
how O
his O
killing O
had O
impacted O
them O
and O
changed O
their O
family O
. O
They O
also O
condemned O
the O
actions O
of O
both O
men O
, O
with O
Cooper-Jones B-PER
testifying O
to O
her O
confusion O
when O
she O
learned O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
was O
with O
Travis B-PER
he O
killed O
Arbery B-PER
. O
At O
first O
, O
she O
said O
, O
she O
questioned O
whether O
that O
could O
be O
true O
. O
“ O
I O
struggled O
to O
come O
to O
the O
realization O
that O
a O
father O
would O
actually O
accompany O
his O
son O
to O
take O
a O
life O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
believe O
that O
, O
because O
me O
as O
a O
mother O
, O
I O
could O
never O
accompany O
my O
son O
to O
do O
any O
type O
of O
crime O
. O
Before O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
was O
sentenced O
, O
he O
acknowledged O
Arbery’s B-PER
family O
, O
who O
were O
in O
court O
, O
saying O
the O
“ O
loss O
that O
you’ve O
endured O
is O
beyond O
description O
. O
There’s O
no O
words O
for O
it O
.” O
“ O
I’m O
sure O
that O
my O
words O
mean O
little O
to O
you O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
assure O
you O
I O
never O
wanted O
any O
of O
this O
to O
happen O
. O
There O
was O
no O
malice O
in O
my O
heart O
or O
my O
son’s O
heart O
that O
day O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
also O
apologized O
to O
his O
wife O
and O
his O
son O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
I O
should O
have O
never O
put O
him O
in O
that O
situation O
.” O
“ O
Finally O
, O
I O
pray O
that O
God’s O
peace O
will O
come O
to O
the O
Arbery B-PER
family O
and O
this O
community O
, O
” O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
said O
. O
Cooper-Jones B-PER
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Sara B-PER
Sidner I-PER
that O
while O
she O
accepted O
the O
apology O
, O
“ O
I O
did O
not O
forgive O
him O
for O
what O
he O
did O
.” O
She O
said O
she O
thought O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
to O
think O
about O
while O
he’s O
been O
in O
jail O
for O
the O
past O
two-plus O
years O
. O

He’s O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
he O
made O
a O
very O
bad O
decision O
, O
and O
he O
wanted O
to O
say O
he O
was O
sorry O
, O
” O
she O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O
So O
I O
did O
accept O
it O
, O
but O
as O
far O
as O
forgiving O
, O
I O
haven’t O
forgave O
him O
. O
Bryan B-PER
later O
issued O
a O
similar O
apology O
, O
but O
Arbery’s B-PER
father O
, O
Marcus B-PER
Arbery I-PER
Sr. O
, O
dismissed O
Bryan’s B-PER
words O
. O
“ O
When O
this O
first O
happened O
, O
he O
should O
have O
shown O
some O
kind O
of O
remorse O
then O
, O
Arbery B-PER
said O
. O
” O

When O
you O
get O
caught O
up O
and O
it’s O
looking O
bad O
for O
you O
, O
that’s O
when O
you’re O
trying O
to O
apologize O
. O

That’s O
a O
bad O
time O
to O
apologize O
. O
He O
should O
have O
did O
that O
day O
one O
.” O
Attorney O
Ben B-PER
Crump I-PER
, O
who O
represents O
the O
Arbery B-PER

, O
said O
he O
hopes O
it O
is O
a O
“ O
turning O
point O
in O
the O
civil O
rights O
movement O
.” O
“ O
This O

killing O
, O
months O
before O
the O
police O
killing O
of O
George B-PER
Floyd I-PER
in O
Minneapolis B-LOC
, O
was O
in O
some O
ways O
a O
harbinger O
of O
the O
nationwide O
protests O
that O
erupted O
that O

” O
of O

. O
Forcing O
him O
to O
serve O
the O

in O
a O
Georgia B-LOC

would O
essentially O
amount O
to O
a O
“ O

” O
that O
could O
leave O
McMichael B-PER
vulnerable O
to O
“ O

she O
argued O
, O
acknowledging O
the O
“ O
rich O

.” O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael’s I-PER
attorney O
made O
a O
similar O
request O
, O
but O
argued O
the O
66-year-old O
should O
be O
kept O
in O

his O
health O

Prosecutors O
opposed O

, O
using O

Prosecutors O

Arbery’s B-PER

pursued O
Arbery B-PER
in O
a O
pickup O
through O

streets O
to O
stop O
him O

he O
never O
took O
anything O

also O
argued O

Transportation B-ORG

Buttigieg I-PER
last O

to O
crack O
down O
on O
the O

. O
The O
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Transportation I-ORG
announced O
new O
rules O
Wednesday O
that O
would O
require O
refunds O
if O
a O

three-hour O

But O
in O
a O
deregulated O
industry O
, O
there’s O
little O
Buttigieg B-PER
can O
do O
about O
the O
fares O
themselves O
. O

Mergers O
mean O
fewer O
choices O
Many O
blame O
the O
consolidation O
in O
the O
industry O
over O
the O
last O
20 O
years O
for O
the O
current O
state O
of O
travel O
. O
Today’s O
four O
dominant O
carriers O
were O
created O
from O
10 O
airlines O
through O
a O
series O
of O
mergers O
. O

And O
another O
merger O
was O
just O
announced O
last O
week O
that O
many O
fear O
will O
once O
again O
lead O

higher O
prices O
. O
Spirit B-ORG
(SAVE), I-ORG
a O
pioneer O
in O
offering O
very O
low O
base O
fares O
which O
are O
then O
supplemented O
by O
fees O
for O
all O
manner O
of O
extras, O
had O
put O
pressure O
on O
the O
bigger O
airlines O
to O
offer O
similar O
frill-free O
seats O
at O
a O
lower O
price. O
But O
Spirit B-ORG
recently O
agreed O
to O
be O
purchased O
by O
JetBlue B-ORG
Airways I-ORG
(JBLU) O
for O
$3.8 O
billion O
in O
cash. O
The O
combination O
will O
form O
the O
country’s O
fifth O
largest O
airline, O
which O
JetBlue B-ORG
says O
will O
create O
more O
competition O
among O
its O
four O
larger O
rivals. O
But O
other O
experts O
say O
the O
loss O
of O
Spirit, B-ORG
if O
the O
merger O
is O
approved, O
can O
only O
mean O
higher O
fares O
down O
the O
road. O
“Fares O
are O
likely O
to O
rise O

facing O
off O
against O
a O

in O
John B-PER
Gibbs I-PER
. O
Gibbs B-PER
has O
fully O
embraced O
Trump’s B-ORG

lies O
. O
He O
wrongly O
claimed O

a O
debate O

Meijer B-ORG
that O
the O
results O
that O
led O
to O
Biden’s B-PER

and O
said O
that O
there O
were O
“anomalies O

What’s O
unique O
about O
the O
GOP B-ORG
contest O
in O
the O
Grand B-LOC
Rapids-based O
3rd O
District O
is O
that O
Democrats B-ORG
have O
attempted O
to O
boost O
Gibbs B-PER
with O
ads O
casting O
him O
as O
a O
Trump-aligned O
conservative O

It’s O
a O
calculated O
gamble O
for O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Congressional I-ORG
Campaign I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
spent O
more O
than O
$300,000 O

in O
the O
race: O
They O
believe O
Gibbs B-PER
would O
be O
much O
easier O
to O
defeat O
in O
November O

so O
they O
are O
attempting O
to O
elevate O
him O
Tuesday O
, O
and O
then O
turn O
and O
immediately O
cast O
him O
as O
a O
threat O
to O
democracy O
in O
the O
general O
election. O
A O
pro-Meijer O
group O
launched O
a O
television O
ad O
over O
the O
weekend O
highlighting O
Democrats’ B-ORG
involvement O
in O
the O
Republican B-ORG

“Fox B-ORG

for O
not O
moving O

address O
the O

One O
of O
the O
criticisms O
of O
the O
administration’s O
response O
, O
as O
CNN B-ORG
reported O
earlier O
Thursday O
, O
was O
that O
HHS B-ORG
waited O
more O
than O
three O
weeks O
after O
the O
first O
confirmed O
case O
of O
monkeypox O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
to O
order O
bulk O
stocks O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
, O
which O
the O
government O
owns O
and O
stores O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
, O
be O
bottled O
and O
sent O
to O
the O
US B-LOC
for O
distribution O
. O
The O
delay O
was O
in O
part O
out O
of O
concern O
that O
once O
those O
vaccines O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
bulk O
storage O
, O
they O
would O
lose O
years O
of O
shelf O
life O
. O
Monkeypox O
can O
infect O
anyone O
, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
cases O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
outbreak O
have O
been O
among O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
, O
including O
gay O
and O
bisexual O
men O
and O
people O
who O
identify O
as O
transgender O
. O
Close O
contact O
with O
an O
infected O
individual O
is O
required O
for O
the O
spread O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
virus O
, O
experts O
say O
. O
The O
CDC B-ORG
initially O
announced O
vaccines O
for O
monkeypox O
were O
being O
released O
from O
the O
Strategic B-ORG
National I-ORG
Stockpile I-ORG
and O
offered O
to O
the O
“high-risk” O
contacts O
of O
monkeypox O
patients O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
health O
care O
workers O
treating O
them O
. O
Federal O
health O
officials O
have O
since O
expanded O
vaccination O
efforts O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
broader O
community O
of O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
, O
the O
demographic O
that O
makes O
up O
most O
US B-LOC
monkeypox O
cases O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
providing O
vaccines O
, O
the O
CDC B-ORG
has O
said O
since O
June B-LOC
it O
has O
made O
a O
concerted O
effort O
to O
do O
extensive O
education O
and O
outreach O
to O
the O
LGBTQ O
community O
. O
Possible O
change O
to O
how O
vaccine O
is O
administered O
Health O
officials O
are O
considering O
changing O
the O
way O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
doses O

because O
the O

“at O

Robert B-PER
Califf I-PER
told O
reporters O
on O
Thursday O

In O
recent O
days O
, O
it’s O
become O
clear O
to O
all O
of O
us O
that O
given O
the O
continued O
spread O
of O
the O
virus O
, O
we’re O
at O
a O
critical O
inflection O
point O

dictating O
the O
need O
for O
additional O
solutions O
to O
address O
the O
rise O
in O

rates O
, O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
The O
goal O
has O
always O
been O
to O
vaccinate O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
. O
” O
The O
commissioner O
said O
officials O
are O
considering O
allowing O
health O
care O
providers O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
a O
dose-sharing O
method O
where O
one O
vial O
of O
Jynneos B-ORG
vaccine O
– O
previously O
used O
as O
one O
dose O
– O
will O
be O
used O
to O
administer O
up O
to O
five O
separate O
doses O
. O
This O
approach O
would O
change O
the O
way O
Jynneos B-ORG
is O
administered O
, O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
vaccine O
being O
administered O
in O
the O
fat O
layer O
under O
the O

, O
it O
will O
be O
delivered O
underneath O

“ O
There O
are O
some O
advantages O
to O
intradermal O
administration O
including O
an O
improved O
immune O
response O
to O
the O
vaccine O
, O
” O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
It’s O
important O
to O
note O
that O
overall O
safety O

not O

this O

Jones’ O
attorney O
, O
Federico B-PER
Andino I-PER
Reynal I-PER
, O
on O
Thursday O
requested O
at O
the O
hearing O
that O
Bankston B-PER
delete O
the O
phone O
records O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
mistrial O
. O
Judge O
Maya B-PER
Guerra I-PER
Gamble I-PER
, O
who O
is O
overseeing O
the O
case O
, O
suggested O
to O
Reynal O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
whether O
his O
motion O
for O
a O
mistrial O
was O
serious O
or O
not O
. O

She O
noted O
he O
has O
repeatedly O
moved O
for O
a O
mistrial O
during O
various O
court O
proceedings O
and O
been O
denied O
each O
time O
. O
After O
Reynal B-PER
indicated O
he O
was O
serious O
in O
asking O
for O
a O
mistrial O
, O
Gamble B-PER
denied O
the O
request O
. O
Reynal B-PER
also O
asked O
for O
10 O
days O
to O
review O
the O
phone O
records O
so O
that O
he O
could O
move O
to O
prevent O
the O
release O
of O
some O
of O
the O
information O
in O
them O
as O
privileged O
. O
Gamble B-PER
denied O
his O
request O
to O
receive O
10 O
days O
, O
but O
did O
give O
him O
some O
time O
to O
him O
to O
review O
the O
material O
and O
research O
whether O
any O

” O
Gamble B-PER
said O
. O
During O
the O

and O
other O
parties O
suing O
Jones B-PER
over O
his O
lies O
regarding O
the O
Sandy B-LOC

. O
Bankston B-PER
said O
he O
was O
inclined O
to O
turn O
that O
information O
over O
, O
barring O
an O
order O
from O
the O
judge O
not O
to O
do O
so O
. O
“ O
I O
don’t O
know O
that O

that O
anyway O
, O
Gamble B-PER
said O
in O

to O
the O
January O
6th O

, O
noting O
they O
would O
likely O

The O
air O
is O
so O
dry O
that O
the O

evaporates O
before O
it O
hits O
the O

And O
the O
conditions O

The O
August O
Complex O
Fire O
was O
originally O
more O
than O
three O
dozen O
fires O
that O
were O
sparked O
by O
dry O
lightning O
. O

Those O
fires O
merged O
to O
become O
the O
largest O
in O

history O
, O
burning O
more O
than O
a O
million O
acres O
in O
seven O

California B-LOC
firefighters O
were O
exhausted O
that O
summer O

concerned O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
more O

more O
fires O

by O
dry O

. O
All O
of O
the O
seven O
largest O

in O
California B-LOC

have O
occurred O
in O
the O
past O
five O

“ O
With O

even O

it O

California I-LOC
, O
an O
area O
where O
lightning O
is O
a O
significant O
cause O
of O
wildfire O
. O
Dry O
lightning O
was O
found O
to O
occur O
most O
frequently O
in O
July B-LOC
and O
August B-LOC
, O
the O
researchers O
found O
, O
though O
lower O

regions O
tended O
to O
see O
activity O
peak O
later O
in O
September B-LOC

October B-LOC

when O
vegetation O

that O
around O
Sacramento B-LOC

San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
, O
Redwood B-LOC
, O
Sequoia B-LOC
and O
Yosemite B-LOC
, O
lightning O

30% O

of O

which O
accounted O
for O
nearly O
50% O
of O
the O
total O
burned O
area O
. O
“ O
That O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fires O
started O
by O
lightning O
, O
which O
are O
usually O
more O
difficult O
to O
attack O
because O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
remote O
than O
human O

Chris B-PER
Vagasky I-PER
, O
a O

told O

. O

Vagasky B-PER
, O
who O
is O
not O
involved O
with O
the O
study O
, O
said O
the O
findings O
provide O
“ O
excellent O
background O
” O
for O
weather O
forecasting O
and O
wildland O
management O
communities O
to O
better O
determine O
the O
conditions O
that O
are O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
occur O
in O
advance O
. O

“This O
really O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O
understanding O
when O
dry O
lightning O
can O
be O
expected O
so O
that O
crews O
can O
be O
at O
the O
ready O
in O
the O
event O
of O
fire O
starting,” O
he O
said. O
“So O
it’s O
good O
to O
see O
that O
there O
is O
now O
a O
study O
for O
this O
region O
of O
the B-LOC
US I-LOC
that O
shows O
not O
just O
the O
time O
of O
year, O
but O
the O
type O
of O
meteorological O
conditions O
that O
appear O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning.” O
The O
research O
is O
just O
the O
first O
step, O
Vagasky B-PER
said. O
“When O
thunderstorms O
do O
develop, O
first O
responders O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
dry O
lightning O
conditions O
may O
be O
possible, O
but O
they O
will O
also O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
quickly O
respond O
to O
areas O
that O
are O
impacted,” O
he O
added. O
Kalashnikov B-PER
said O
there O
are O
still O
uncertainties O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
lightning O
research, O
whether O
dry O
lightning O
will O
occur O
more O
often O
as O
the O
climate O
changes. O
But O
one O
thing O
is O
certain, O
he O
said, O
as O
the B-LOC
Western I-LOC
drought O
persists, O
conditions O
are O
much O
more O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
take O
shape. O
In O
just O
the O
last O
year O
alone, O
dry O
lightning O
has O
sparked O
deadly O
and O
destructive O
wildfires O
such O
as O
the O
Bootleg O
Fire O
in O
Oregon B-LOC
that O
burned O
more O
than O
400,000 O
acres. O
“We O
know O
it’s O
getting O
hotter O
and O
drier O
— O
California B-LOC
is O
becoming O
hotter O
and O
drier,” O
Kalashnikov B-PER
said. O
“So O
we O
can O
say O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
trend O
in O
lightning O
is O
doing, O
when O
lightning O
happens O
with O
a O
hotter, O
drier O
atmosphere O
and O
vegetation, O
it’s O
just O
going O
to O
lead O
to O
more O
of O
a O
risk O
of O
these O
kinds O
of O
wildfire O
outbreaks O
like O
we O
saw O
in O
2020.” O

For O

could O
have O

leaving O
the O
three O

making O
it O
increasingly O
difficult O

officials O
have O
already O
discovered O
key O
details O

which O
they O
revealed O

including O
confirmation O
that O
the O

Doe I-LOC
by O
the O
coroner’s O
office O
, O
are O
one O
of O
at O
least O
three O
sets O
uncovered O
due O
to O
the O
dramatically O
receding O
water O
levels O
at O
Lake B-LOC
Mead I-LOC
, O
which O
has O
plunged O
to O
unprecedented O
lows O
amid O
a O
critical O
water O
crisis O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
. O
Police B-ORG
previously O
announced O
they O
placed O
the O
Hemenway B-LOC
Harbor I-LOC
Doe’s O
approximate O
time O
of O
death O
as O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid-’70s O
to O
early O
‘80s O
, O
based O
on O
the O
victim’s O
clothes O
and O
shoes O
. O
Johansson B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
the O
clothing O
was O
so O
well O
preserved O
in O
the O
freshwater O
environment O
that O
investigators O
were O
still O
able O
to O
read O
the O
clothing O
labels O
. O

But O
without O
an O
ID O
, O
investigators O
are O
extremely O
limited O
. O

And O
the O
more O
time O
passes O
, O
the O
harder O
it O
will O
be O
to O
identify O
aging O
witnesses O
and O
potential O
suspects O
. O
“ O
If O
you O
think O
about O
what O
the O
age O
of O
who O
your O
witnesses O
or O
anybody O
related O
to O
this O
case O
would O
be O
, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
getting O
older O
every O
day O
. O
And O
they’re O
at O
an O
age O
where O
you O
have O
to O
worry O
, O
are O
they O
even O
alive O
? O
” O

And O
so O
I O
would O
say O
that’s O
probably O
our O
biggest O
concern O
right O
now O

preliminarily O

the O

the O

The O

more O

both O

available O

despite O
being O
immersed O

the O

, O
the O

said O

Police B-ORG
are O
not O
investigating O
the O

no O

suspicious O
circumstances O
in O

but O
he O
has O
no O
doubt O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
Hemenway B-LOC

Doe’s O
death O
are O
nefarious O
. O
“ O
Anytime O
you O

clearly O
there O

Theories O
of O

the O
Hemenway B-LOC

swirl O
as O
soon O
as O
details O
emerged O
that O
the O

were O
found O
inside O
a O
barrel O
. O
Those O
ideas O
were O
fueled O
even O
more O
when O
police B-ORG
announced O
the O
victim O
was O
likely O
killed O
at O
a O
time O
when O
organized O
crime O
had O
a O
strong O
grasp O
on O
Las B-LOC

But O
those O
ideas O
are O
“mere O
speculation” O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
investigation O
, O
Johansson B-PER
said O
, O
denying O
that O
there O
is O
any O
solid O
evidence O
to O
support O
mob O
theories O
. O
“Yes O
, O
Vegas B-LOC
does O
have O
a O
history O
in O
the O
past O
where O
we O
had O

, O
to O
organized O
crime O
back O
in O
the O
’60s O
, O
the O

, O
he O
said O
. O
“However O
, O
right O
now O
, O
there’s O
nothing O
in O
this O

that O

But O
as O
the O

a O

the O

One O
possible O
scenario O
for O
the O
second O
two O

is O
that O
they O
belong O
to O
people O

previously O

drove O
his O

In O

he O
admitted O
the O

The O

started O
to O
rise O
quickly O

he O
pulled O
up O

trapping O
him O
inside O
his O

he O
said O
began O
floating O

His O
only O
option O
was O
to O
try O
to O
steer O
the O

into O
an O
old O

he O
had O
left O
parked O
outside O

“ O
I O

I O

he O
said O

Diving O
out O
the O

, O
he O
made O
it O
to O
safety O
by O
climbing O
on O
top O
of O
the O
tanker O
, O
where O
he O
remained O
for O
15 O
hours O
as O

downed O

rushed O
past O
him O

“ O
I O

about O

Bolling B-PER

I O
found O
peace O

I O
wasn’t O

I O
had O
a O

While O

Bolling B-PER
texted O

he O

“PTSD O

I O
kind O

how O
to O
go O

you O
know, O
I O
gotta O
fix O
myself O
first,” O
he O
said. O
But O
along O
with O
the O
sorrow, O
there’s O
pride, O
too, O
in O
the O
way O
their O
Appalachian B-LOC
community O
has O
come O
together, O
with O
neighbors O
who O
lost O
everything O
helping O
neighbors O
in O
the O

Volunteers O
from O
all O

have O
been O
sweeping O
and O
using O
small O
bulldozers O
to O
get O
mud O
out O
of O
buildings O
this O
week. O
And O
while O
proud O
of O
their O
independent O
and O
resilient O
community, O
officials O
in B-LOC
Fleming-Neon B-LOC
admit O
the O
city O
is O
desperate O
for O
all O
the O
help O
it O
can O
get. O
“Our O
infrastructure O
needs O
help O
from O
Washington, B-LOC
from O
Frankfort. B-LOC
We’re O
going O
to O
have O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
help,” O
Fire O
Chief O

said. O
Gary B-PER
Clink, I-PER
who O
has O
lived O
just O
outside O
of O
Hindman B-LOC
for O
decades, O
was O
rescued, O
along O
with O
his O
wife O
and O
a O
neighbor, O
by O
his O
son-in-law, O
he O
said. O
Now O
he’s O
trying O
to O
save O
his O
wet O
furniture O
from O
mildew O
in O
the O
muddy O
interior O
of O
his O
home, O
which O
had O
more O
than O
4 O
feet O
of O
water O
in O
it O
during O
the O
flood. O
“It’s O
like O
someone O
turned O
the O
switch O
to O
maximum O
overdrive,” O
explained O
Clink B-PER
as O
he O
sat O
on O
the O
porch O
looking O
at O
what O
was O
left O
of O
his O
belongings O
drying O
out O
on O
the O
lawn, O
“I’ve O
never O
seen O
water O
like O
that. O
It’s O
like O
a O
dam O
burst O
or O
a O
tsunami. O
“That’s O
the O
reason O
you O
see O
garbage O
wherever O
you O
look, O
houses O
wrecked. O
I’ve O
seen O
three O
homes O
I O
knew O
basically O
lifted O
up O
off O
the O
foundation O
base, O
as O
they O
washed O
down O
the O
stream O
and O
it O
ripped O
them O
apart.” O
And O
he O
worries O
that O
this O
catastrophe O
won’t O
be O
the O
last. O
“I O
believe O
you’re O
seeing O
the O
effects O
of O
climate O
change O
right O
here,” O
Clink B-PER
said. O
“Just O
given O
time, O
if O
we O
don’t O
turn O
it O
around, O
just O
given O
time, O
it’s O
going O
to O
get O
worse.” O
Some O
are O
also O
concerned O
that O
people O
will O
leave O
the O
area O
because O
the O
devastation O
is O
too O
extreme. O
“This O
is O
literally O
the O
end O
of O
this O
little O
community,” O
Clink B-PER
sighed, O
“These O
people, O
you’ll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
had O
decent O
appliances, O
decent O
furniture, O
decent O
clothes, O
but O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
decent. O
“If O
they O
didn’t O
have O
flood O
insurance O
or O
FEMA B-ORG
can’t O
step O
in O
and O
actually O
help… O
this O
is O
the O
end O

the O
line O
for O
this O
community. O
I O
don’t O
see O
any O
way O
they O
are O
going O
to O
come O

back O
from O
it O
.” O
Bolling B-PER
agreed O

It’s O
country O
back O
here O

It’s O
slow O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
love O
it O
. O
We O
stay O
back O
here O

” O
Bolling B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
But O
at O
the O

time O

it’s O
never O
going O

will O

decided O

Rosie B-PER

a O

At O

one O

played O
the O

British B-LOC

“ O
It O
was O
just O
horrible O

I O
was O
expecting O
it O
to O

it O
had O
been O

a O

, O
she O
said O
the O

“ O
very O
backwards O

( O
I O
feel O
) O
naive O
to O

been O
any O

Sometimes O
polling O
trends O
meet O
your O
expectations O
. O
For O
example O
, O
you O
might O
expect O
a O
president’s O
approval O
rating O
to O
be O
low O
when O
we’re O
dealing O
with O
high O
inflation O
and O
negative O
growth O
in O
real O
disposable O
income O
per O

. O
Sometimes O
, O
however O
, O
trends O
in O
public O
opinion O
are O
surprising O
. O
Even O
as O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER

approval O
rating O
languishes O
south O
of O
40 O
% O
, O
Democrats O
aren’t O
just O
holding O
their O
own O
on O
the O
generic O

They’re O
actually O
improving O
their O
position O
as O
Biden B-PER

standing O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
gets O
worse O
. O
It’s O
with O
this O
odd O
phenomenon O
that O
we O
start O
our O
look O
at O
the O
political O
week O
that O
was O
. O
Biden B-PER
’s O
unpopular O
, O
but O
so O
are O
Republicans O
Republicans O
now O
hold O
an O
average O
advantage O
of O
less O
than O
a O
point O
on O
the O
generic O
congressional O
ballot O
, O
which O
usually O
asks O
respondents O
some O
form O
of O
the O
following O
question O
: O
“ O
If O
the O

held O
today O
, O
would O
you O
vote O

the O

party O
?” O
Republicans O
were O
ahead O
on O
this O
metric O
by O
3 O
to O
4 O
points O
in O
May B-LOC
. O
Our O
CNN/SSRS B-ORG
poll O
published O
a O
little O
less O
than O
two O
weeks O
ago O
was O
one O
of O
several O
recent O
surveys O
that O
have O
reflected O
this O
tightening O
. O
Republicans O
were O
ahead O
by O
an O
average O
of O
4 O
points O
in O
the O
two O
polls O
CNN B-ORG
released O
in O
May B-LOC
that O
included O
this O
question O
. O
The O
two O
parties O
were O
tied O
in O
the O
poll O
released O
this O
month O
. O
When O
we O
examine O
this O
latest O
CNN B-ORG
poll O
more O
closely O
, O
we O
get O
a O
very O
good O
idea O
of O
why O
Democrats O
are O
even O
with O
Republicans O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
. O
It’s O
because O
Republicans O
are O
also O
unpopular O
. O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
voters O
who O
don’t O
like O
either O
Biden B-PER
or O
the O
GOP O
. O
Biden B-PER
’s O
favorable O
rating O
in O
the O
poll O
was O
just O
38 O
% O
among O
those O
who O
were O
asked O
the O
generic O
ballot O
question O
. O
His O
unfavorable O
rating O
stood O
at O
55 O
% O
. O
Biden B-PER
’s O
net O
favorability O
was O
-17 O
points O
. O
The O
Republican B-ORG

standing O
wasn’t O
really O
any O
better O
. O
Only O
35 O
% O
rated O
the O

favorably O
. O
A O
plurality O
( O
50 O
% O
) O
had O
an O
unfavorable O
view O
. O
The O
GOP O
’s O
net O
favorability O
was O
-15 O
points O
. O
It O
turns O
out O
that O
33 O
% O
of O
the O
electorate O
holds O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Republicans O
and O
does O
not O
have O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Biden B-PER
. O
The O
Republicans O
are O
winning O
this O
group O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
, O
96 O
% O
to O
2 O
. O
Likewise O
, O
36 O
% O
of O
the O
electorate O
holds O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Biden B-PER
and O
doesn’t O
have O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Republicans O

Democrats O
are O
crushing O
among O
this O
group O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
, O
94 O
% O
to O
1 O
. O
The O
other O
big O
chunk O
of O
the O
electorate O
( O
29 O
% O
) O
is O
made O
up O
of O
those O
who O
like O
neither O
Biden B-PER
nor O
the O
Republicans O
. O
These O
voters O
are O
more O
divided O
in O
their O
generic O
ballot O
preferences O

, O
with O
Republicans B-ORG
at O
42% O
and O
Democrats B-ORG
at O
35% O
. O
Because O
there O
are O
slightly O
more O
people O
who O
like O
Biden B-PER
than O
those O
who O
like O
the O
GOP B-ORG
and O
since O
the O
group O
that O
doesn’t O
like O
either O
has O
relatively O
close O
preferences O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
, O
the O
race O
overall O
remains O
tight O
. O
The O
question O
is O
whether O
the O
current O
polling O
can O
possibly O
hold O
through O
Election O
Day O
. O

Midterms O
are O
usually O
a O
referendum O
on O
the O
president’s O
party O
. O
Anger O
at O
the O
president’s O
party O
could O
be O
what O
ultimately O
sways O
voters O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
current O
polling O
is O
, O
in O
some O
ways O
, O
reminiscent O
of O
what O
occurred O
during O
the O
2016 O
presidential O
election O
. O
Nearly O
20% O
of O
the O
electorate O
did O
not O
look O
favorably O
on O
both O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
and O
Hillary B-PER
Clinton I-PER
. O
Trump B-PER
won O
this O
group O
by O
nearly O
20 O
points O
and O
, O
with O
them O
, O
the O
election O
. O
When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
voters O
who O
are O
backing O
Democratic O
congressional O
candidates O
but O
don’t O
like O
Biden B-PER
, O
the O
current O
numbers O
actually O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
. O
These O
voters O
overwhelmingly O
lean O
Democratic O
( O
85% O
) O
when O
asked O
about O
their O
party O
identification O
. O
They’re O
also O
overwhelmingly O
young O
( O
79% O
are O
under O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
) O
. O

The O
latter O
of O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
something O
I O
noticed O
earlier O
this O
cycle O
. O
Biden’s B-PER
favorable O
rating O
among O
those O
under O
50 O
is O
shockingly O
low O
( O
32 O
%) O
given O
that O
younger O
voters O
are O
usually O
part O
of O
the O
Democratic O
base O
. O
Yet O
, O
these O
same O
voters O
are O
going O
48% O
to O
39% O
for O
Democrats O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
. O
The O
bottom O
line O
is O
Republicans B-ORG
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
count O
on O
voters O
defaulting O
to O

Put O
another O
way O
, O
Democrats O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
win O
this O
upcoming O
midterm O
. O
Republicans B-ORG

have O
hurt O
Trump B-PER
Another O
related O
reason O
Republicans B-ORG
may O
be O
hurting O
in O
the O
polls O
has O
to O
do O
with O
what O
has O
been O
in O
the O
news O
. O
Mainly O
, O
the O
former O
President O
has O
been O
in O
the O
news O
a O
lot O
lately O
. O

Republicans B-ORG
have O
generally O
been O
better O
off O
without O
him O
in O
the O
news O
, O
and O
the O
same O
is O
true O
for O
Trump B-PER
himself O
. O
It O
turns O
out O
that O
he’s O
been O
getting O
more O
unpopular O
of O
late O
. O
His O
net O
favorability O
rating O
stands O
south O
of O
-15 O
points O
in O
an O
average O
of O
recent O
polls O
. O
That’s O
the O
worst O
it’s O
been O
in O
over O
a O
year O
. O
Trump’s B-PER
net O
favorability O
rating O
has O
shrunk O
every O
month O
since O
March B-LOC
. O
That O
drop O
has O
been O
most O
dramatic O
this O
past O
month O
, O
when O
he O
was O
most O
in O
the O
news O
. O
Trump’s B-PER
net O
favorability O
is O
now O
lower O
than O
his O
average O
net O
approval O
rating O
during O
his O
time O
in O
office O
. O
Something O
clearly O
has O
changed O
, O
and O
one O
obvious O
culprit O
is O
the O
House B-ORG
select O
committee O
investigating O
the O
January O
6 O
, O
2021 O
, O

The O
lead-up O

the O

closely O
with O
Trump’s B-PER

an O

has O
been O
in O
the O

a O
lot O

But O
it O
isn’t O
only O
with O
the O
general O
electorate O
that O
Trump B-PER
may O
be O
having O
some O
weakness O

Manchin B-PER
said O
Sunday O
he O
hopes O
the O
legislation O
passes O
before O
the O
August B-LOC
recess O
, O
which O
is O
what O
Democratic O
leadership O
is O
hoping O
for O
. O
The O
senator’s O
support O
is O
notable O
given O
his O
stance O
earlier O
this O
month O
that O
he O
“ O
unequivocally O
” O
wouldn’t O
support O
the O
climate O
or O
tax O
provisions O
of O
the O
Democratic O
economic O
package O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
torpedo O
any O
hope O
Democrats O
had O
of O
passing O
legislation O
to O
fight O
climate O
change O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O
But O
he O
told O
Tapper B-PER
on O
Sunday O
that O
he O
“ O
never O
did O
walk O
away O
” O
from O
negotiations O
with O
Schumer B-PER
. O
“ O
I O
never O
did O
walk O
away O
, O
but O
we O
reorganized O
the O
bill O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

What O
we O
had O
before O
that O
, O
there O
were O
things O
in O
there O
that O
I O
considered O
and O
thought O
could O
be O
considered O
to O
be O
inflammatory O
. O
… O
Inflation O
is O
the O
greatest O
challenge O
we O
have O
in O
our O
country O
right O
now O
– O
around O
in O
my O
state O
and O
around O
the O

So O
that’s O
what O
we’re O
fighting O

whether O

culminating O

home O
on O
Monday O
– O
reinforce O
a O
fundamental O
fact O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
situation O
: O
He O
is O
far O
more O
likely O
to O
see O
a O
2024 O
run O
for O
president O
curtailed O
by O
legal O
problems O
than O
political O
ones O
. O
Politically O
, O
Trump B-PER
remains O
the O
800-pound O
gorilla O
in O
the O
Republican B-ORG

convincingly O
won O

And, O
he O
has O
all O
but O
announced O
his O
intention O
to O
run O
again, O
with O
the O
major O
question O
at O
this O
point O
being O
when O
he O
will O
announce O
his O
candidacy O
– O
not O
whether O
he O
will O
do O
so. O
Trump B-PER
posted O
a O
campaign-style O
video O
on O
his O
Truth B-ORG

Tuesday O
morning, O
saying O
“the O
best O
is O
yet O
to O

Trump’s B-PER
mounting O
legal O
woes O
– O
or O
at O
least O
the O
clear O
sense O
that O
this O
variety O
of O

is O
getting O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
him O
– O
complicate O
all O
of O
that. O
Trump B-PER
under O
legal O
fire O
is O
one O
thing O
for O

to O
accept. O

Trump O
under O

is O
something O
else O
entirely O

We O
are O
, O
of O
course O
, O
not O
there O
yet O
. O
But O
, O
Monday’s O
FBI B-ORG
activity O
suggests O
that O
Trump’s B-PER
legal O
problems O
are O
likely O
to O
get O
worse O
before O
they O
get O
better O
. O
And O
they O

yes O

But O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
CNN B-ORG
, O
she O
offered O
a O
more O
muted O
response O

I O
’ve O
talked O
about O
this O
at O
length O
, O
about O
the O
2020 O

” O
Dixon B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
It O
was O
unlike O
any O

we O
had O

obviously O
because O

in O

were O
some O

didn’t O
happen O
in O

which O
are O
very O
concerning O

Dixon B-PER

quickly O
slammed O
her O
for O
appearing O
to O
water O
down O
her O
views O
on O
the O

. O
Garrett B-PER
Soldano I-PER
, O
a O
chiropractor O
vying O
for O
the O
GOP B-ORG
nomination O
, O
panned O
Dixon B-PER
for O
dodging O
the O
2020 O
election O
question O
and O
doubled O
down O
on O
his O
support O
for O
the O
former O
President O
. O
“ O
The O
election O
, O
in O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
was O
stolen O

he O
said O
in O
an O

“ O
I O
’m O
not O
even O
endorsed O
by O
President O
Trump B-PER
, O
and O
I O
still O
have O
his O
back O

Soldano B-PER
then O
turned O
his O
stare O
straight O
down O
the O
lens O
of O
a O
CNN B-ORG
camera O
, O
seemingly O
hoping O
to O
address O
Trump B-PER
directly O
. O
“ O
Even O
though O
, O
sir O
, O
you O
didn’t O
endorse O

you O

” O
Soldano B-PER
said O
. O
Businessman-turned-candidate O
Kevin B-PER
Rinke I-PER
also O
bashed O
Dixon B-PER
for O
dancing O
around O
election O
falsehoods O
. O
“ O
She O
got O
an O
endorsement O

within O
48 O
hours O
when O
she O
was O
asked O
on O
national O
TV O
if O
the O

was O
stolen O
, O
she O
changed O
her O
mind O
, O
” O
Rinke B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
That O
's O
what O
politicians O
do O
. O
Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
is O
the O
Republican O
version O
of O
Gretchen B-PER
Whitmer I-PER
– O
‘ O
I O
’ll O
say O
anything O
, O
I O
’ll O
do O
anything O

, O
he O
said O
referring O
to O
the O
state O

Democratic O
governor O
. O
Rinke B-PER
didn’t O
go O
so O
far O
as O
to O
claim O
the O
election O
was O
stolen O
and O
acknowledged O
that O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
is O
the O
President O
. O

Still, O
he O
said O
he O
believes O
there O
were O
“irregularities” O
in O
2020. O
Meantime, O
Ryan B-PER
Kelley, I-PER
a O
real O

broker O
in O
the O

has O
essentially O
turned O
his O
arrest O
for O
allegedly O
participating O
in O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
riot O
into O
a O
campaign O
rallying O
cry. O
“Look O
how O
hard O
these O
people O
are O
trying O
to O
silence O
me,” O
Kelley B-PER
said O
in O
a O
July O
GOP B-ORG
primary O
debate. O

I O
got O
arrested O
. O
I O
got O
kicked O
off O
Airbnb B-ORG
. O
He O
has O
pleaded O
not O
guilty O
to O
the O
misdemeanor O
charges O
he O
faces O
and O
has O
continued O
to O
falsely O
claim O
Trump B-PER
won O
in O
2020 O
. O
Republican B-ORG
activists O
here O
have O
rallied O
behind O
Trump-loving O
, O
election-denying O
candidates O
. O

At O
an O
endorsement O
convention O
earlier O
this O
year O
, O
Republicans B-ORG
backed O
Kristina B-PER
Karamo I-PER
for O
secretary O
of O
state O
and O
Matthew B-PER
DePerno I-PER
for O
attorney O
general O
, O
paving O
their O
path O
for O
official O
nominations O
later O
this O
year O
. O
If O
they O
win O
in O
November O
, O
they O
would O
be O
in O
key O
positions O
to O
oversee O
the O
state’s O
elections O
. O

But O
the O
prospect O
of O
having O
Dixon B-PER
atop O
the O
ticket O
has O
rankled O
some O
Trump B-PER
supporters O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
her O
less-than-enthusiastic O
embrace O
of O
the O
election O
falsehoods O
fueling O
the O
base O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
she’s O
given O
lip O
service O
to O
President O
Trump B-PER

his O
supporters O
on O
those O
issues O
but O
only O
when O
truly O
pushed O
, O
” O
GOP B-ORG
political O
strategist O
John B-PER
Yob I-PER
said O
in O
an O
interview O
. O
“ O
President O
Trump B-PER
still O
is O
very O
popular O
with O
conservative O
voters O
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
his O
endorsement O
will O
definitely O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
this O
race O
, O
” O
Yob B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
However O
, O
it O
also O
puts O
things O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
precarious O
situation O
with O
some O
of O
his O
supporters O
being O
left O
dazed O

confused O
because O
they’ve O
been O
behind O
other O

maybe O
more O
MAGA-centric O
, O
candidates O
and O
now O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
he’s O
endorsed O

The O
former O

team O
doesn’t O
share O
the O
concern O
that O
Dixon B-PER
may O
not O
be O
as O
vocal O
on O
election O
issues O
, O
said O
a O
person O
close O
to O
Trump B-PER

Dixon B-PER
has O
largely O
shrugged O
off O
the O
criticism O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
that’s O
interesting O

” O
she O
said O
of O
the O
election-related O
barbs O
from O
her O
GOP B-ORG
opponents O
, O
“ O
because O
my O

a O

a O
whole O
list O

they O
hate O
me O

the O

right O

I O
guess O
it’s O
just O
a O
campaign O

Dixon B-PER
said O
she O
believed O
she O
could O
get O
a O
boost O
from O
the O
Trump B-PER

declined O
to O

whether O
she O
would O
back O
him O

“ O
I O

feels O

China’s B-LOC
threat O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
is O
“more O
serious O
than O
ever,” O
but O
the O
island O
will O
stand O
firm O
to O
protect O
its O
freedom O
and O
democracy O
– O
including O
by O
welcoming O
those O
who O
support O
it, O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
Foreign O
Minister O
Joseph B-PER
Wu I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
an O
interview O
Monday. O
Wu’s B-PER
defiant O
message O
came O
as O
China B-LOC
said O
it O
continued O
military O
drills O
around O
the O
self-governing O
island, O
after O
a O
four-day O
show O
of O
force O
following O
US B-ORG
House O
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi’s I-PER
trip O
to O
Taipei B-LOC
last O
week. O
“China B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
threatening O
Taiwan B-LOC
for O
years O
and O
it’s O
getting O
more O
serious O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years,” O
Wu B-PER
said. O
“Whether O
Speaker O
Pelosi B-PER
visits O
Taiwan B-LOC
or O
not, O
the O
Chinese O
military O
threat O
against O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
there O
and O
that O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
need O
to O
deal O
with.” O
Welcoming O
overseas O
friends O
to O
the O
island O
was O
a O
key O
part O
of O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
strategy O
to O
counter O
China’s B-LOC
attempts O
to O
isolate O
it O
from O
the O
international O
community O
– O
regardless O
of O
the O
potential O
backlash O
from O
Beijing, B-LOC
Wu B-PER
said. O
“(China) B-LOC
cannot O
dictate O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
we O
should O
not O
welcome O
anyone O
who O
likes O
to O
come O
and O
show O
support O
for O
Taiwan,” O
said O
Wu, B-PER
who O
has O
served O
as O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
foreign O
minister O
since O
2018. O
Pelosi’s B-PER
Taiwan B-LOC
trip O
– O
the O
first O
by O
a O
sitting O
House O
Speaker O
to O
the O
island O
in O
25 O
years O
– O
was O
vehemently O
opposed O
by O
China’s B-LOC
ruling O
Communist O
Party, O
which O
views O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
its O
territory O
despite O
never O
having O
controlled O
it. O
In O
the O
wake O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit, O
Beijing B-LOC
has O
ramped O
up O
pressure O
on O
Taiwan, B-LOC
including O
via O
economic O
penalties, O
the O
launch O
of O
missiles O
over O
the O
island O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
and O
drills O
that O
Taipei B-LOC
has O
said O
were O
meant O
to O
“simulate” O
an O
attack O
against O
its O
main O
island O
and O
navy. O
Though O
those O
exercises O
were O
originally O
expected O
to O
end O
Sunday, O
drills O
around O
Taiwan B-LOC
continued O
Monday, O
according O
to O
an O
announcement O
from O
China’s B-LOC
military. O
But O
as O
the O
live-fire O
drills O
raised O
global O
fears O
of O
a O
possible O
military O
conflict, O
the O
mood O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
remained O
calm, O
with O
life O
carrying O
on O
as O
usual O
with O
packed O
restaurants O
and O
crowded O
public O
transport. O
For O
Wu, B-PER
the O
threat O
made O
it O
even O
more O
critical O
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
continue O
to O
build O
its O
international O
relationships O
and O
show O
it O
is O
not O
afraid. O

I O
worry O
that O
China B-LOC
may O
really O
launch O
a O
war O
against O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
But O
what O
it O
is O
doing O
right O
now O
is O
trying O
to O
scare O
us O
and O
the O
best O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
( O
is O
) O
to O
show O
to O
China B-LOC
that O
we O
are O
not O
scared O
.” O
Pelosi B-PER
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
Though O
her O
trip O
was O
long O
mooted O
and O
much O
discussed O
, O
Taiwanese O
officials O
only O
received O
short O
notice O
of O
her O
arrival O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Since O
her O
travel O
is O
always O
subject O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
considerations O

considerations O
… O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
out O
until O
the O
very O
last O
moment O
when O
she O
firmed O
up O
her O
plan O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
, O
adding O
Taipei B-LOC
knew O
the O
itinerary O
a O
few O
days O
beforehand O
, O
but O
not O
the O
exact O
timing O
of O
her O
arrival O
. O
The O
visit O
from O
the O
speaker O
and O
an O
accompanying O
congressional O
delegation O
included O
meetings O
at O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
legislature O
and O
the O
office O
of O
Taiwanese O
President O
Tsai B-PER
Ing-wen I-PER
, O
where O
Pelosi B-PER
said O
they O
came O
to O
send O
an O
“ O
unequivocal O
message O
” O
that O
“ O
America B-LOC
stands O
with O
Taiwan B-LOC
.” O
Wu B-PER
said O
his O
most O
memorable O
impression O
of O
the O
trip O
was O
greeting O
Pelosi B-PER
and O
the O
delegation O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
where O
she O
“ O
showed O
her O
charm O
” O
by O
saying O
she’d O
been O
looking O
forward O
to O
her O
visit O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
“ O
And O
by O
the O
time O
she O
departed O
, O
she O
not O
only O
said O
goodbye O
to O
me O
, O
but O
also O
said O
goodbye O
to O
the O
ground O
crew O
, O
the O
security O
people O

and O
to O
those O
people O
who O
had O
been O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
airport O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
” O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O
When O
asked O
whether O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
would O
increase O
its O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC
after O
the O
visit O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
the O
US B-ORG
has O
always O
been O
“ O
highly O
supportive O
” O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
– O
but O
the O
current O
support O
was O
“ O
unprecedented O
.” O
In O
an O
exclusive O
interview O
with O
CNN B-ORG
last O
October O
, O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
President O
Tsai B-PER
Ing-wen I-PER
confirmed O
some O
US B-ORG
military O
trainers O
were O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
– O
the O
first O
time O
a O
Taiwanese O
leader O
had O
admitted O
to O
their O
presence O
since O
Washington B-LOC
and O
Taipei B-LOC
severed O
diplomatic O
ties O
in O
1979 O
. O
But O
perceptions O
of O
American O
support O
sparked O
Beijing’s B-LOC
ire O
against O
the O
speaker’s O
visit O
, O
with O
China’s B-LOC
foreign O
ministry O
issuing O
a O
statement O
on O
the O

“ O

Beijing B-LOC
announced O
the O
large-scale O
military O
exercises O
in O
what O
it O
said O
were O
six O
zones O
around O
the O
island O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
swiftly O
after O
Pelosi’s B-PER
arrival O
, O
in O
response O
to O
what O
it O
viewed O
as O
an O
infringement O
of O
China’s B-LOC
“ O
sovereignty O

territorial O
integrity O

While O
the O
US B-ORG
and O
many O
of O
its O
allies O
have O
decried O
the O
drills O
, O
China B-LOC
defended O
its O
actions O
as O
“ O
legitimate O

and O
justified O
,” O
saying O
it O
was O
the O
US B-ORG
, O
not O

who O
was O
“ O
the O

where O

‘Wrecking’ O
the O

Taiwan B-LOC

more O
than O
seven O
decades O

, O
in O
which O
the O
defeated O
Nationalists B-PER
fled O
to O
Taipei B-LOC

Taiwan B-LOC
transitioned O
from O
authoritarian O

a O
democracy O
in O
the O
1990s O

In O
recent O

, O
as O
his O
power O

grown O
, O
Chinese O
leader O
Xi B-PER

made O
clear O
his O
ambitions O
to O
“reunify” O

force O
if O
necessary O
. O
Wu B-PER
accused O
China B-LOC
of O
trying O
to O
change O
the O
status O
quo O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
, O
including O
by O
conducting O
military O
exercises O
in O
recent O
days O
across O
the O

– O
the O
halfway O
point O
between O

previously O

an O

Dozens O

crossed O

between O
Thursday O

Sunday O
, O
according O
to O
accounts O
from O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
Defense B-ORG

. O
While O
the O
informal O
median O
line O
has O
largely O
preserved O
peace O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
for O
decades O
, O
China B-LOC
now O
openly O
denies O
its O
existence O
. O
“This O
kind O
of O
behavior O
is O
wrecking O
the O

, O
and O
it’s O
wrecking O

in O
this O
region O
and O
it O
should O
not O
be O
accepted O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
, O
adding O
that O
China B-LOC
had O
sought O
to O
declare O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
as O
its O
internal O
waters O
for O
“some O
time” O
before O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit O
. O
That O
had O
implications O
beyond O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
China B-LOC
seeks O
to O
expand O
its O
influence O
across O
the O
Western O
Pacific O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
he O
remained O
optimistic O
about O
the O
future O

Democracy O
is O
going O
to O
prevail O
, O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
If O
you O
look O
at O

it’s O
not O
resilient O

” O

It O
may O
appear O
strong O

and O
it O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
expanding O

But O
it’s O
not O
resilient O
and O
at O
some O
point O

going O
to O
break O
.” O
When O
asked O
if O
the O
situation O
could O
be O
called O
a O
crisis O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
that O
was O
ultimately O
up O
to O
Beijing B-LOC
. O
“ O
It O
depends O
on O
the O
will O
of O
the O

” O
Wu B-PER

he O
doesn’t O
know O
whether O

“ O
have O
made O
up O
their O
mind O
” O
to O
use O

to O
take O
Taiwan B-LOC

but O
Taiwanese O
officials O
were O
“ O
looking O
at O
several O
different O
scenarios O
, O
” O
in O
particular O
due O
to O
concerns O
that O
Beijing B-LOC

seek O
to O
divert O
attention O
from O

problems O
by O
creating O
a O
crisis O
in O
the O

“ O

that O

Democrats’ O
push O
to O
advance O
their O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
bill O
is O
likely O
headed O
for O
a O
procedural O
speed O
bump O
known O
in O
Washington B-LOC
as O
a O
“vote-a-rama.” O
The O
time-consuming O
and O
stamina-challenging O
process O
is O
among O
the O
final O
obstacles O
for O
Democrats, O
along O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian’s O
review O
of O
the O
package. O
Politically, O
a O
vote-a-rama O
gives O
Republicans B-ORG
a O
chance O
to O
sow O
discord O
and O
create O
distractions O
as O
they O
force O
Democrats O
to O
vote O
on O
controversial O
issues. O
But, O
once O
it’s O
over, O
Democrats O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
advance O
their O
package O
on O
a O
straight O
party-line O
vote O
that O
would O
not O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
filibuster’s O
60-vote O
threshold. O
Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know: O
What O
is O
a O
vote-a-rama? O
Usually O
in O
the O
legislative O
process, O
lawmakers O
can O
use O
a O
series O
of O
procedural O
maneuvers O
to O
avoid O
voting O
on O
amendments. O
But O
in O
a O
budget O
reconciliation O
process O
– O
which O
Democrats O
are O
using O
to O
advance O
their O
bill O
– O
you O
can’t O
do O
that. O
Lawmakers O
cannot O
hold O
a O
final O
vote O
on O
a O
reconciliation O
bill O
until O
all O
the O
amendments O
have O
been O
“disposed O
of,” O
or O
in O
simpler O
terms, O
“voted O
on.” O
The O
practice O
involves O
votes O
on O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
that O
can O
– O
and O
usually O
do O
– O
stretch O
for O
hours. O
How O
do O
lawmakers O
use O
the O
process? O

The O
party O
in O
charge O
typically O
wants O
to O
move O
this O
vote-a-rama O
along O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
with O
as O
few O
votes O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
minority O
party O
takes O
the O
opportunity O
to O
force O
votes O
on O
all O
kinds O
of O
measures O
they O
don’t O
typically O
have O
the O
power O
to O
put O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
How O
long O
does O
each O
vote O
take O
? O

Usually O
, O
lawmakers O
agree O
to O
a O
process O
that O
looks O
a O
lot O
like O
this O
. O
Each O
amendment O
takes O
about O
15 O
minutes O
or O
so O
to O
get O
through O
. O
The O
process O
moves O
quickly O
by O
Senate B-ORG
standards O
, O
which O
is O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
for O
members O
to O
basically O
stay O
in O
or O
close O
by O
the O
chamber O
for O
the O
entire O
marathon O
event O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill O
? O

The O
bill O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ O
goals O
, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years O
: O
Still O
, O
this O
isn’t O
Build O
Back O
Better O
2.0 O
. O
The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
key O
Democratic O
priorities O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
left O

And O
what O
does O
Maneskin O

? O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
It O
means O
moonlight O
I O
picked O
it O
when O
we O
first O
started O
playing O
because O
we O
needed O
to O
join O
this O
musical O
competition O
, O
and O
we O
didn’t O
have O
a O
name O
yet O
, O
so O
they O
just O
told O
me O
just O
say O
random O
words O
in O
Danish O
, O
and O
we O
chose O
one O
. O
Looking O
back O
at O
this O
last O
year O
, O
I’m O
sure O
it’s O
been O
absolutely O
crazy O
for O
you O
, O
from O
where O
you O
were O
a O
year O
ago O
to O
now O
? O
Damiano B-PER
David I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
it’s O
been O
a O
crazy O
journey O
, O
but O
of O
course O
we O
are O
really O
happy O
about O
everything O
that O
we O
did O
, O
and O
every O
time O
we O
look O
back O
, O
all O
the O
steps O
, O
we O
are O
super O
happy O
and O
proud O
. O
What O
has O
been O
the O
most O
surprising O
, O
maybe O
the O
most O
exciting O
thing O
, O
that O
has O
happened O
to O
you O
this O
past O
year O
? O

Raggi B-PER
: O
I O
think O
that O
we’ve O
had O
lots O
of O
incredible O
moments O
during O
this O
last O
year O
. O
Maybe O
a O
song O
with O
Iggy B-PER
Pop I-PER
is O
one O
of O
these O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
playing O
with O
The B-ORG
Stones I-ORG
. O

I O
mean O
a O
lot O
, O
it’s O
been O
a O
lot O
. O

Now O
you’re O
filling O
stadiums O
with O
70,000 O
people O
, O
selling O
out O
tickets O
for O
80,000 O
, O
and O
you’ve O
said O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
for O
you O
guys O
to O
even O
find O
a O
place O
to O
play O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O
What O
was O
that O
like O
when O
you O
started O
: O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
It O
was O
very O
difficult O
because O
in O
Rome B-LOC
there’s O
no O
real O
rock O
scene O
, O
so O
there’s O
no O
like O
clubs O
wanting O
bands O
to O
play O
their O
stuff O
, O
and O
also O
people O
are O
not O
very O
used O
to O
going O
to O
gigs O
of O
upcoming O
artists O
. O
They O
just O
go O
to O
the O
famous O
ones O
that O
they O
already O
know O
, O
so O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
and O
that’s O
why O
we O
started O
playing O
as O
buskers O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

We O
were O
always O
fighting O
with O
the O
other O
street O
artists O
about O
having O
the O
best O
spot O
, O
and O
we O
never O
won O
, O
but O
… O
(laughter) O
. O
And O
then O
you O
do O
Eurovision O
, O
how O
did O
it O
change O
your O
life O
? O
David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
that O
was O
our O
first O
actual O
window O
outside O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O
Since O
that O
moment O
we O
were O
only O
basing O
our O
projects O
for O
Italy B-LOC
and O
on O
Italy B-LOC
and O
that O
was O
the O
chance O
to O
break O
out O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
then O
from O
Europe B-LOC
to O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
and O
we O
hope O
to O
grow O
more O
and O
more O
. O
What O
was O
it O
like O
to O
win O
for O
Italy B-LOC
? O
It O
had O
been O
like O
30 O
years O
since O
Italy B-LOC
had O
won O
Eurovision O
, O
and O
then O
you O
win O
with O
rock O
n’ O
roll O
, O
a O
genre O
which O
is O
not O
very O
big O
there O
? O
Raggi B-PER
: O
Yes O
, O
that’s O
crazy O
. O

David B-PER
: O
That O
was O
unexpected O
I O
think O
for O
everybody O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
everyone O
was O
very O
proud O
, O
big O
celebration O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
times O
for O
Eurovision O
winners O
, O
they O
have O
that O
big O
moment O
and O
then O
they O
kind O
of O
disappear O
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
makes O
you O
guys O
different O
that O
you’ve O
been O
able O
to O
take O
this O
and O
catapult O
so O
much O
and O
become O
this O
worldwide O
phenomenon O
? O
David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
for O
us O
Eurovision O
came O
at O
a O
very O
right O
moment O
because O
we O
had O
just O
come O
out O
with O
an O
album O
, O
so O
what O
we O
brought O
to O
Eurovision O
was O
basically O
just O
one O
of O
the O
things O
of O
the O
whole O
album O
and O
it O
was O
fresh O
, O
and O
it O
was O
super O
authentic O
for O
us O
. O
So O
, O
I O
think O
that O
people O
were O
happy O
to O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
coherence O
between O
what O
we O
brought O
to O
Eurovision O
and O
what O
they O
saw O
in O
our O
catalogue O
, O
and O
they O
felt O
like O
, O
OK O
, O
this O
is O
not O
just O
a O
viral O
song O
that O
they O
made O
specifically O
for O
Eurovision O
, O
but O
it’s O
just O
one O
of O
their O
songs O
and O
then O
they O
have O
two O
albums O
, O
and O
it O
all O
makes O
sense O
. O
Then O
, O
you O
release O
“Beggin’ O
, O
” O
which O
turns O
into O
the O
most O
successful O
rock O
song O
of O
last O
year O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
woke O
up O
every O
morning O
I O
think O
for O
the O
last O
year O
like O
, O
(sings) O
, O
“I’m O
beggin’ O
, O
beggin’ O
you O
… O
(laughter) O
… O
It O
just O
gets O
in O
my O
head O
, O
and O
then O
I’m O
like O
, O
come O
on O
, O
just O
get O
out O
! O
David B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
it’s O
our O
fault O
, O
it’s O
our O
fault O
, O
(laughter) O

Well, O
it’s O
not O
even O
our O
fault O
because O
we O
didn’t O
even O
promote O
it. O
It’s O
TikTok’s B-ORG
fault. O
It O
just O
got O
viral. O
We O
were O
pretty O
shocked O
by O
it. O
When O
we O
saw O
it O
growing, O
we O
were O
like, O
what O
is O
happening, O
and O
then O
we O
found O
out O
it O
was O
viral O
on O
TikTok B-ORG
and O
all O
that O
came O
about O
after. O
Why O
that O
song? O

It’s O
a O
cover O
of O
Frankie B-PER
Valli I-PER
and O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
, O
and O
I O
can’t O
think O
of O
a O
more O
different O
style O
than O
you O
guys O
and O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Actually O
, O
we O
played O
it O
at O
first O
, O
when O
we O
just O
started O
, O
and O
we O
think O
it’s O
way O
more O
challenging O
and O
fun O
to O
make O
covers O
of O
very O
different O
songs O
. O
So O
, O
like O
now O
we’re O
also O
playing O
“ O
Womanizer B-PER
” O
by O
Britney B-PER
Spears I-PER
, O
for O
example O
, O
and O
we O
just O
find O
it O
a O
challenge O
and O
stimulating O
, O
and O
it O
really O
makes O
you O
do O
an O
interpretation O
of O
something O
different O
and O
bringing O
it O
into O
your O
own O
. O
That’s O
when O
you O
make O
something O
good O
, O
I O
think O
. O

You O
also O
covered O
“If O
I O
Can O
Dream” O
for O
the O
Elvis B-PER
movie, O
what O
was O
it O
like O
singing O
an O
Elvis B-PER
song? O
I O
mean, O
you O
know, O
“The O
King O
of O
Rock O
n’ O
Roll.” O
David: B-PER
Well, O
every O
time O
when O
we O
have O
some O
big O
deals, O
we O
try O
not O
to O
think O
about O
it O
that O
much O
because O
then O
you O
get O
like O
anxious, O
and O
you O
feel O
the O
pressure. O
When O
we O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
play O
a O
cover O
of O
Elvis, B-PER
we O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
we O
were O
confronting O
Elvis B-PER
because O
that O
would O
have O
been O
impossible, O
you O
cannot O
try O
to O
fight O
with O
Elvis’ B-PER
heritage. O

We O
were O
just O
super O
happy O
and O
super O
glad O
and O
super O
honored O
just O
to O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
play O
one O
of O
his O
songs O
, O
and O
we O
focused O
on O
that O
, O
and O
we O
focused O
on O
doing O
the O
best O
that O
we O
could O
do O
on O
that O
song O
without O
even O
comparing O
it O
with O
the O
Elvis B-PER
one O
because O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it’s O
untouchable O
. O
Now O
you O
have O
two O
VMA B-ORG
nominations O
and O
a O
third O
number O
one O
song O
on O
the O
Billboard B-ORG
charts O
, O
“Supermodel O
, O
can O
you O
tell O
me O
what O
the O
song O
is O
about O
? O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
The O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
it’s O
about O
supermodels O
, O
but O
it’s O
not O
. O
We O
wrote O
it O
after O
being O
like O
three O
months O
in O
L.A. B-LOC
where O
we O
met O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
were O
faking O
being O
supermodels O
or O
superstars O
. O
Everyone O
was O
very O
focused O
on O
the O
way O
they O
appeared O
and O
not O
what O
they’re O
really O
like O
or O
who O
they O
really O
were O
. O
Everyone O
was O
just O
trying O
to O
fake O
that O
they O
have O
the O
best O
clothes O
, O
best O
friends O
, O
best O
club O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
and O
we O
found O
it O
a O
bit O
stupid O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
that O
we O
thought O
was O
only O
shown O
in O
movies O
, O
like O
a O
stereotype O
, O
you O
know O
, O
but O
when O
we O
saw O
it O
in O
person O
, O
we O
just O
thought O
it O
was O
fun O
and O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
funny O
song O
about O
it O
. O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
no O
one O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
is O
like O
that O
. O

We O
are O
very O
real O

If O
you O
had O
to O
make O
a O
song O
about O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
what O
would O
it O
be O
about O
? O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Ohhh O
. O
.. O
(laughs) O
… O
we O
need O
to O
spend O
more O
months O
here O
. O
David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
like O
a O
club O
song O
, O
super O
dirty O
, O
clubbish O
… O
(laughter) O
. O
You’ve O
played O
different O
festivals O
, O
like O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
but O
this O
weekend O
you O
are O
doing O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
in O
Chicago B-LOC
. O

What O
does O
it O
mean O
to O
play O
at O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
here O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
: O
Raggi B-PER
: O
Crazy O
, O
it’s O
huge O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
It’s O
our O
first O
Festival O
in O
the O
USA B-LOC
. O
So O
, O
that’s O
like O
a O
big O
, O
big O
thing O
… O
David B-PER
: O
It’s O
not O
our O
first O
festival O
! O
We O
played O
at O
Coachella B-ORG
, O
c’mon O
! O

… O
(Laughter) O
De B-PER
Angelis: I-PER
Whoops, O
that’s O
true, O
Coachella. O
We O
started O
this O
festival O
season O
this O
summer, O
and O
it’s O
only O
been O
Europe B-LOC
until O
now, O
so O
for O
this O
summer O
it’s O
the O
first. O
Raggi: B-PER
For O
the O
summer, O
yes. O
You O
sing O
in O
English O
and O
Italian, O
but O
we O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
Italian O
singers O
who O
are O
huge O
in O
Latin O
America, B-LOC
and O
they O
sing O
in O
Spanish O
– O
Laura B-PER
Pausini, I-PER
Eros B-PER
Ramazzotti, I-PER
Il O
Volo O
– O
do O
you O
think O
you O
would O
ever O
sing O
in O
Spanish? O
David: B-PER
Why O
not? O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
In O
Spanish O
? O
David B-PER
: O
I O
basically O
mostly O
listen O
to O
Spanish O
sounding O
music O
, O
so O
I O
would O
not O
back O
up O
… O
(laughs) O
You’re O
going O
to O
launch O
your O
tour O
, O
and O
you’re O
going O
to O
Latin O
America O
, O
Santiago B-LOC
, O
Buenos B-LOC
Aires I-LOC
. O
What’s O
it O
like O
going O
to O
all O
these O
places O
, O
is O
it O
a O
culture O
shock O
when O
you O
go O
? O
David B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we O
have O
never O
been O
, O
outside O
of O
Ethan B-PER
, O
we’ve O
never O
been O
to O
Latin O
America O
, O
and O
we O
never O
played O
there O
, O
but O
of O
course O
, O
we O
know O
something O
about O
the O
people O
there O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
they’re O
really O
crazy O
… O
(laughter) O
… O
hyped O
up O
, O
heated O
up O
, O
and O
we O
like O
these O
kinds O
of O
crowds O
. O
So O
, O
we O
can’t O
wait O
to O
play O
there O
, O
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
amazed O
me O
the O
most O

When O
I O
saw O
the O
tickets O
that O
were O
selling O
, O
it O
was O
like O
“ O
what O
the O
f**k O
?” O
how O
did O
we O
get O
there O
? O
It O
was O
crazy O
, O
so O
we O
really O
can’t O
wait O
to O
be O
there O
. O
How O
has O
fame O
changed O
you O
, O
if O
at O
all O
? O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
I O
don’t O
think O
it O
has O
changed O
us O
. O
David B-PER
: O
I’m O
less O
worried O
about O
things O
, O
actually O

I O
guess O
I’m O
stable O
… O
(laughs) O
Do O
you O
feel O
that O
fame O
, O
when O
you’re O
this O
well-known O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
responsibility O
to O
speak O
out O
on O
certain O
political O
issues O
? O
A O
lot O
of O
artists O
say O
, O
I’m O
an O
entertainer O
, O
not O
a O
politician O
or O
an O
activist O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
for O
us O
, O
I O
think O
it O
comes O
naturally O
, O
so O
when O
we O
think O
we O
know O
enough O
about O
a O
topic O
, O
and O
we O
think O
our O
opinion O
can O
, O
like O
, O
make O
the O
difference O
or O
something O
we O
don’t O
feel O
it O
like O
as O
a O
pressure O
or O
something O
. O
It O
just O
comes O
naturally O
, O
and O
we’re O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O
Also O
, O
if O
we O
can O
share O
a O
positive O
message O
on O
something O
that O
really O
matters O
to O
us O
, O
we’re O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O

If O
not O
, O
we O
also O
don’t O
feel O
the O
pressure O
to O
have O
to O
do O
it O
. O
You O
did O
a O
song O
in O
support O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
“ O
We’re O
Gonna O
Dance O
on O
Gasoline O
, O
” O
how O
do O
you O
feel O
about O
that O
situation O
? O
David B-PER
: O
It’s O
really O
hard O
to O
say O
that O
because O
we O
feel O
very O
bad O
about O
it O
, O
but O
we O
also O
know O
that O
we O
have O
a O
huge O
privilege O
, O
with O
no O
worries O
, O
we’re O
not O
worried O
that O
something O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
us O
. O

So, O
we O
are O
privileged, O
but O
of O
course, O
if O
we O
can O
spread O
knowledge O
about O
it, O
we O
are O
more O
than O
happy, O
and O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
because O
that’s O
something O
that O
is O
happening O
today O
and O
if O
we O
can O
do O
something O
today, O
it’s O
more O
valuable. O
One O
of O
your O
first O
songs O
was O
“Zitti O
E O
Buoni,” O
which O
means O
“Shut O
Up O
and O
Behave.” O
It O
doesn’t O
seem O
like O
you O
guys O
are O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
any O
shutting O
up O
or O
behaving O
any O
time O
soon. O
De B-PER
Angelis: I-PER
No, O
not O
at O
all. O

Where O
do O
you O
go O
from O
here O
: O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
I O
don’t O
know O
, O
we O
feel O
very O
free O
. O
We O
just O
want O
to O
keep O
playing O
. O
We O
have O
so O
many O
amazing O
gigs O
and O
tours O
coming O
in O
front O
of O
us O
, O
so O
I O
think O
we’re O
really O
going O
to O
enjoy O
it O
and O
get O
all O
the O
possible O
inspiration O
from O
that O
and O
then O
turn O
it O
into O
music O
. O
We O
don’t O
want O
to O
set O
any O
specific O
goals O
, O
but O
we O
just O
want O
to O
go O
on O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
and O
keep O
getting O
better O
and O
doing O
what O
we O
feel O
is O
right O
. O
CNN’s B-ORG
Marysabel B-PER
Huston-Crespo I-PER
contributed O
to O
this O
report O
. O

When O
a O
bipartisan O
group O
of O
lawmakers O
visited O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
border O
in O
March O
, O
an O
unexpected O
guest O
showed O
up O
on O
the O
trip O
: O
GOP B-ORG
Rep. O
Victoria B-PER
Spartz I-PER
of O
Indiana B-LOC
. O
Spartz B-PER
, O
the O
first O
Ukrainian-born O
member O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
Congress I-ORG
and O
an O
outspoken O
advocate O
for O
her O
home O
country O
, O
had O
expressed O
interest O
in O
joining O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
but O
wasn’t O
invited O
to O
attend O
the O
trip O
, O
which O
consisted O
primarily O
of O
House B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
members O
, O
a O
panel O
where O
Spartz B-PER
is O
not O
a O
member O
. O
So O
, O
she O
used O
her O
own O
funds O
to O
fly O
to O
the O
border O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
linked O
up O
with O
lawmakers O
once O
there O
to O
join O
in O
on O
some O
of O
their O
meetings O
, O
according O
to O
multiple O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
situation O
. O
Her O
surprise O
appearance O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
which O
have O
not O
been O
previously O
reported O
, O
was O
initially O
viewed O
as O
a O
welcome O
addition O
– O
albeit O
an O
unusual O
one O
– O
as O
lawmakers O
sought O
to O
rally O
Western O
support O
for O
Ukraine B-LOC
amid O
Russia’s B-LOC
bloody O
assault O
on O
the O
country O
that O
began O
a O
week O
earlier O
. O
But O
members O
who O
were O
part O
of O
the O
official O
trip O
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
Spartz B-PER
was O
“argumentative O
, O
“accusatory O
, O
and O
“unhelpful” O
during O
key O
meetings O
with O
NATO B-ORG
members O
, O
generals O
and O
government O
officials O
, O
sparking O
concern O
that O
her O
presence O
was O
doing O
more O
harm O

good O
. O
“She O
crashed O
our O

She O

one O
GOP B-ORG
lawmaker O

who O
like O
other O

for O
this O
story O
was O
granted O
anonymity O
to O
speak O
more O
freely O
about O
a O
colleague O

due O
to O
the O
sensitive O
nature O
of O
the O
subject O
. O
“I O
don’t O
know O
if O
it O
was O
pent-up O
frustration O
or O
she O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
she O
was O
getting O
enough O
proper O
information O

but O
she O
was O
just O
accusatory O
and O
rude.” O
Spartz B-PER
, O
in O
an O
email O
to O
CNN B-ORG
, O
pushed O
back O
on O
the O
anonymous O
criticism O
of O
her O
decision O
to O
elbow O
her O
way O
into O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
and O
refuted O
the O
description O
of O
her O
behavior O
on O
the O
trip O
. O
“This O
accusation O
is O
a O
cowardly O
misrepresentation O
of O
facts O
by O
some O
jealous O

staff O
since O
we O
had O
a O
very O
productive O
bipartisan O
CODEL O
in O
March O
,” O
Spartz B-PER
said O
. O
“I O
did O
not O
come O
to O
Congress B-ORG

get O
paid O

my O

but O
rather O
get O

I O

always O
been O
willing O

spend O
my O
own O
hard-earned O
money O

I O
care O
about.” O
That O
bipartisan O
frustration O
over O
Spartz’s B-PER
behavior O
was O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O
In O
the O
nearly O
six O
months O
since O
the O
war O
began O
, O
Spartz B-PER
has O
publicly O
criticized O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
government O
, O
peddled O
corruption O
allegations O
against O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
government O
and O
some O
of O
Ukrainian B-LOC
President O
Volodymyr B-PER
Zelensky’s I-PER
top O

spurred O
complaints O
from O
her O
colleagues O
that O
she O
is O
mir O

roring O
pro-Russia O
talking O
points O
. O
“ O
President O
Zelensky B-PER
has O
to O
stop O
playing O
politics O

and O
start O
governing O
to O
better O
support O
his O
military O
and O
local O
governments O
, O
” O
Spartz B-PER
said O
in O
a O
press O
release O
last O
month O
, O
in O
one O
example O
of O
her O
outspoken O
criticisms O
of O
Kyiv B-LOC
. O
Spartz B-PER
, O
a O
43-year-old O
businesswoman O
, O
has O
repeatedly O
insisted O
, O
publicly O
and O
privately O
, O
that O
she O
wants O
Ukraine B-LOC
to O
win O
, O
and O
that O
she O
is O
only O
attacking O
Kyiv B-LOC
because O
she O
wants O
to O
help O
remove O
any O
potential O
obstacles O
to O
a O
Ukrainian O
victory O
over O
Russia B-LOC
. O
She O
says O
she O
has O
visited O
Ukraine B-LOC
six O
times O
since O
the O
invasion O
began O
and O
has O
also O
slammed O
Russia B-LOC
consistently O
, O
including O
as O
recently O
as O
Tuesday O
when O
she O
tweeted O
that O
Russia B-LOC
should O
be O
declared O
a O
terrorist O
state O
. O
Still O
, O
Spartz’s B-PER
bellicose O
rhetoric O
aimed O
at O
Zelensky B-PER
and O
his O
advisers O
has O
frustrated O
lawmakers O
in O
both O
parties O
, O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
and O
members O
of O
the O
Ukrainian O
parliament O
alike O
. O
They O
worry O
she O
is O
undermining O
their O
efforts O
to O
stay O
united O
behind O
Ukraine B-LOC
at O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
and O
openly O
question O
where O
she O
is O
getting O
some O
of O
her O
information O
, O
according O
to O
interviews O
with O
over O
a O
dozen O
lawmakers O
, O
aides O
and O
administration O
sources O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
multiple O
briefings O
from O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
and O
private O
pleas O
from O
senior O
Republicans B-ORG
have O
done O
little O
to O
rein O
in O
Spartz’s B-PER
vocal O
criticism O
, O
sources O
said O
. O
Once O
seen O
as O
a O
crucial O
messaging O
asset O
, O
Spartz B-PER
has O
now O
become O
something O
of O
a O
liability O
for O
defense O
hawks O
who O
were O
already O
worried O
about O
fatigue O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
over O
the O
ongoing O
war O
abroad O
. O
And O
her O
continued O
criticism O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
also O
comes O
amid O
growing O
skepticism O
from O
the O
MAGA O
wing O
of O
the O
GOP B-ORG
about O
keeping O
weapons O
and O
aid O
flowing O
to O
the O
country O
. O

Because O
she’s O
the O
only O
Ukrainian-born O
member O
of O
Congress B-ORG
, O
she O
has O
outsize O
megaphone O
, O
outsize O

Rep. O
Elissa B-PER
Slotkin I-PER
, O
a O
Michigan B-LOC
Democrat O
and O
former O
CIA B-ORG
analyst O
, O
said O
to O
CNN B-ORG
. O
I O
think O
there’s O
an O
open O
question O
of O
why O
she’s O
so O
openly O
saying O
something O
that’s O
so O
clearly O
aligned O
with O
Russian B-LOC
talking O
points O
. O
Spartz B-PER
contends O
she O
has O
long O
been O
concerned O
about O
corruption O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O
But O
lawmakers O
fear O
her O
public O
criticism O
could O
undermine O
confidence O
in O
Zelensky B-PER
, O
damage O
relations O
between O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
and O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
and O
give O
on-the-fence O
lawmakers O
a O
reason O
to O
oppose O
the O
next O
aid O
package O
. O
Some O
lawmakers O
– O
even O
those O
unhappy O
with O
her O
rhetoric O
– O
came O
to O
Spartz’s B-PER
defense O
, O
arguing O
she O
is O
well-intentioned O
and O
just O
desperate O
to O
help O
her O
motherland O
as O
it’s O
being O
ripped O
apart O
by O
war O
. O
Spartz B-PER
was O
a O
vocal O
champion O
of O
key O
legislation O
to O
speed O
up O
the O
administration’s O
ability O
to O
send O
weaponry O
and O
other O
critical O
resources O
to O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
attending O
the O
bill O
signing O
ceremony O
with O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
. O
And O
lawmakers O
in O
both O
parties O
have O
shared O
in O
her O
calls O
for O
more O
rigorous O
oversight O
of O
the O
weapons O
heading O
into O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

She O
was O
overcome O
with O
emotion O
. O

And O
I O
think O
what O
you’re O
seeing O
now O
is O
a O
manifestation O
of O
that O
,” O
said O
a O
second O
GOP B-ORG
lawmaker O
. O

What O
I’m O
trying O
to O
tell O
her O
is O
, O
I’m O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
corruption O
problem O
. O

But O
talking O
about O
corruption O
now O
, O
when O
they O
are O
under O
siege O
, O
is O
like O
wall-papering O
your O
bathroom O
when O
the O
house O
is O
burning O
down O
around O
you O
. O
It’s O
counterproductive O
. O
Spartz B-PER
said O
in O
an O
email O
to O
CNN B-ORG
that O
she O
is O
just O
seeking O
accountability O
and O
always O
gets O
her O
information O
“from O
the O

real O
professionals O

not O
from O

never O

And O
Spartz B-PER
said O
it O
was O
the O
“foreign O

her O

was O

“I O

about O

the O
meeting O

where O
the O
officials O
walked O
through O
her O
claims O

improper O
behavior O
inside O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
government O
and O
either O
refuted O
the O

said O
there O
was O
not O

Spartz B-PER

The O
meeting O
was O
first O
reported O
by O

When O
they O
met O
, O
she O
again O
raised O
concerns O
about O

alleged O
that O
US-provided O

Milley B-PER
did O
not O
dismiss O

Broadly O
, O
however O
, O
Milley B-PER
explained O
to O
Spartz B-PER
that O
her O
concerns O
were O
overwrought O
, O
the O
sources O
explained O
. O

Spartz B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
her O
meeting O
with O
Milley B-PER
“was O
not O
my O
first O

him,” O
and O
that O
“I O
give O

willingness O
to O
listen.” O
“I O
believe O
he O
understands O
the O
challenges O
of O
our O
effort O
in O
Ukraine, B-LOC

the O
politicians O

foreign O
policy O

are O
making O
strategic O
decisions, O
not O
military O
leaders,” O
she O
said. O
“This O
should O
trouble O
all O

oversaw O
the O

Several O
days O

continued O
her O
public O

But O
he O
did O
credit O
the O

in O

As O
monkeypox O
cases O
have O
skyrocketed O
in O
the O
US B-LOC

predominantly O
among O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
, O
the O
stigma O
associated O
with O
it O
has O
also O
grown O
– O
including O
in O
the O
medical O
community O
. O
A O
recent O
CNN B-ORG
investigation O
found O
that O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
rising O
case O
numbers O
, O
some O
phlebotomists O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
have O
refused O
to O
draw O
blood O
from O
patients O
with O
suspected O
monkeypox O
, O
preventing O
these O
patients O
from O
obtaining O
medically O
necessary O
and O
physician-ordered O
tests O
. O
Yet O
the O
definition O
of O
“suspected O
monkeypox” O
and O
the O
other O
details O
around O
these O
cases O
remain O
murky O
at O
best O
. O
As O
CNN B-ORG
noted O
in O
its O
reporting O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
if O
the O
phlebotomists O
refused O
to O
perform O
blood O
draws O
, O
or O
whether O
company O
policy O
prohibited O
it O
. O
Are O
these O
encounters O
in O
which O
gay O
men O
are O
being O
denied O
bloodwork O
simply O
because O
they O
are O
gay O
and O
monkeypox O
is O
now O
associated O
with O
this O
demographic O
? O
Or O
are O
these O
situations O
in O
which O
patients O
with O
visible O
and O
infectious O
pustules O
are O
presenting O
to O
diagnostic O
testing O
sites O
where O
phlebotomists O
are O
worried O
about O
whether O
proper O
safety O
policies O
and O
procedures O
are O
in O
place O
? O
In O
the O
first O
encounter O
, O
homophobia O
is O
the O
driving O
factor O
; O
in O
the O
second O
, O
any O
reasonable O
health O
care O
provider O
would O
similarly O
have O
reservations O
about O
putting O
themselves O
at O
risk O
. O
(Even O
though O
the O
US B-LOC
Centers B-ORG
for O
Disease B-ORG
Control I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prevention I-ORG
suggests O
that O
virus O
levels O
in O
infected O
people’s O
blood O
are O
low O
, O
non-bloodborne O
transmission O
routes O
such O
as O
directly O

may O
increase O
a O
health O

worker’s O
possible O
risk O
of O
getting O
infected O
without O
adequate O
PPE O
) O
We O
are O
gay O
men O
, O
and O
seeing O
those O
in O
our O
community O
denied O
medical O
care O
echoes O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
HIV/AIDS O
epidemic O
. O
Originally O
called O
GRID O
( O
gay O
related O
immunodeficiency O
) O
, O
the O
outbreak O
resulted O
in O
discrimination O
and O
stigmatization O
of O
LGBTQ+ O
individuals O
across O
society O
regardless O
of O
infectious O
status O
. O
It O
is O
discriminatory O
to O
assume O
that O
an O
identity O
is O
itself O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
disease O
and O
that O
avoidance O
of O
complete O
segments O
of O
society O
is O
an O
appropriate O
safety O
mechanism O
. O
Yet O
these O
faulty O
assumptions O
remain O
the O
cornerstone O
of O
homophobia O
in O
modern O
day O
medicine O
and O
account O
for O
much O
of O
the O
mistrust O
that O
LGBTQ+ O
people O
have O
toward O
the O
health O
care O
system O

But O
as O
medical O
professionals O
, O
we O
also O
understand O
the O
fear O
that O
comes O
with O
encountering O
patients O
who O
have O
highly O
infectious O
diseases O
. O
Eric B-PER
has O
been O
a O
frontline O
physician O
since O
day O
one O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
and O
is O
now O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
patients O
with O
monkeypox O
. O
Tom B-PER
has O
worked O
with O
patients O
in O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
during O
the O
Delta O
Covid-19 O
surge O
. O
We O
understand O
the O
real O
fear O
of O
contracting O
viruses O
at O
work O
, O
and O
– O
as O
a O
married O
couple O
– O
we O
recognize O
the O
concern O
about O
bringing O
disease O
home O
to O
loved O
ones O
. O
With O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
, O
we O
watched O
as O
guidelines O
on O
PPE O
changed O
out O
of O
convenience O
rather O
than O
out O
of O
scientific O
data O
and O
saw O
our O
coworkers O
– O
fellow O
doctors O
, O
nurses O
, O
phlebotomists O
, O
radiology O
technicians O
, O
janitorial O
staff O
, O
security O
– O
contract O
the O
virus O
from O
their O
patients O
. O
No O
one O
goes O
into O
medicine O
to O
hurt O
patients O
– O
everyone O
in O
health O
care O
has O
decided O
to O
work O
in O
an O
industry O
that O
tries O
to O
improve O
the O
lives O
of O
others O
. O
Yet O
, O
it O
would O
be O
unconscionable O
to O
expect O
everyone O
in O
health O
care O
to O
put O
their O
own O
health O
at O
risk O
to O
help O
their O
patients O
. O

And O
coming O
off O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
experience O
, O
there O
is O
justified O
mistrust O
and O
persistent O
fear O
among O
many O
health O
care O
personnel O
. O
The O
way O
to O
ameliorate O
the O
situation O
at O
large O
– O
both O
to O
bolster O
the O
health O
and O
safety O
of O
health O
care O
workers O
and O
to O
address O
the O
stigmas O
associated O
with O
monkeypox O
– O
is O
twofold O
: O
education O
and O
proper O
safety O
policies O
including O
the O
provision O
of O
personal O
protective O
equipment O
. O
Health O
care O
providers O
at O
all O
levels O
must O
be O
included O
in O
trainings O
about O
what O
monkeypox O
is O
, O
how O
it O
is O
spread O
( O
and O
how O
it O
isn’t O
) O
and O
mechanisms O
to O
keep O
themselves O
safe O
while O
caring O
for O
all O
patients O
– O
both O
those O
with O
monkeypox O
and O
those O
without O
. O
We O
must O
make O
it O
clear O
what O
safety O
procedures O
are O
necessary O
and O
ensure O
all O
providers O
have O
access O
to O
materials O
like O
PPE O
at O
all O
times O
. O
We O
must O
allow O
each O
health O
care O
worker O
the O
chance O
to O
ask O
questions O
about O
how O
monkeypox O
impacts O
their O
job O
. O
As O
a O
medical O
community O
, O
we O
will O
more O
than O
likely O
identify O
lapses O
in O
our O
policies O
and O
ways O
to O
improve O
them O
. O

Feeling O
protected O
is O
a O
key O
motivator O
for O
behavior O
change O
. O
We’ve O
seen O
the O
evolution O
in O
how O
we’ve O
interacted O
with O
, O
treated O
and O
dealt O
with O
HIV O
through O
the O
rise O
of O
universal O
precautions O
, O
aimed O
to O
protect O
health O
care O
workers O
. O
These O
precautions O
were O
introduced O
by O
the O
CDC B-ORG
in O
the O
1980s O
in O
response O
to O
the O
HIV O
epidemic O
when O
a O
lot O
was O
unknown O
about O
the O
virus O
, O
and O
they O
include O
protocols O
for O
hand O
hygiene O
; O
wearing O
gloves O
, O
goggles O
and O
gowns O
; O
and O
specific O
transmission-route O
based O
precautions O
. O
If O
followed O
properly O
, O
they O
can O
prevent O
the O
transmission O
of O
bloodborne O
pathogens O
and O
other O
infectious O
materials O
. O

The O
availability O
of O
pre-exposure O
prophylaxis O
, O
post-exposure O
prophylaxis O
and O
HIV O
treatment O
have O
even O
further O
decreased O
the O
fear O
around O
infection O
with O
HIV O
among O
health O
care O
providers O
. O
Additionally O
, O
vaccines O
to O
prevent O
monkeypox O
, O
like O
Jynneos O
, O
are O
hard O
to O
find O
and O
must O
first O
go O
to O
patients O
at O
highest O
risk O
of O
disease O
. O
The O
CDC B-ORG
advises O
people O
who O
are O
exposed O
to O
monkeypox O
through O
their O
jobs O
, O
such O
as O
clinical O
laboratory O
personnel O
who O
perform O
diagnostic O
tests O
, O
to O
get O
the O
vaccine O
as O
a O
pre-exposure O
prophylaxis O
, O
and O
some O
health O
care O
workers O
who O
were O
exposed O
to O
patients O
with O
monkeypox O
have O
gotten O
the O
vaccine O
as O
a O
post-exposure O
prophylaxis O
to O
prevent O
illness O
or O
mitigate O
symptoms O
. O
But O
supplies O
are O
still O
low O
, O
and O
once O
the O
vaccines O
are O
more O
readily O
available O
, O
they O
should O
be O
offered O
as O
a O
pre-exposure O
prophylaxis O
to O
a O
broader O
range O
of O
health O

workers O

Labcorp B-ORG

Dr. O

Brian B-PER
Caveney I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
last O
week O
that O
some O
of O
their O
phlebotomists O
“have O
been O
scared” O
of O
monkeypox. O
Without O
specific O
information O
on O
what O
exactly O
is O
driving O
these O
phlebotomists O
to O
refuse O
blood O
draws, O
shaming O
health O
care O
workers O
for O
being O
afraid O
(despite O
potentially O
lacking O
PPE O
and O
updated O
information O
on O
monkeypox) O
or O
assuming O
that O
it O
stems O
exclusively O
from O
homophobia, O
feels O
a O
little O
myopic. O
As O
case O
numbers O
are O
projected O
to O
climb O
and O
the O
future O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
outbreak O
remains O
uncertain, O
careful O
messaging, O
knowledge O
sharing O
and O
destigmatizing O
should O
be O
our O
collective O
priority. O

Health O
care O
workers O
must O
feel O
heard O
and O
protected O
, O
as O
many O
of O
us O
are O
exhausted O
, O
fearful O
and O
burnt O
out O
from O
working O
nonstop O
through O
more O
than O
two O
years O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
. O

But O
that O
cannot O
mean O
we O
overlook O
the O
needs O
of O
our O
gay O
, O
bisexual O
, O
queer O
and O
transgender O
patients O
– O
an O
already O
stigmatized O
group O
jaded O
from O
decades O
of O
minority O
stress O
. O
Institutional O
and O
public O
health O
strategies O
must O
make O
everyone O
– O
patients O
and O
providers O
alike O
– O
feel O
safe O
and O
welcome O

Colin B-PER

Make O
a O
so-so O
adaptation O
and O
you O
risk O
the O
wrath O
of O
Austen’s B-PER
legions O
of O
readers: O
Take O
“Persuasion,” O
which O
caused O
a O
massive O
stink O
before O
it O
was O
even O
released O
in O
July B-LOC
when O
its O
trailer O
included O
snippets O
of O
new, O
modernized O
dialogue O
that O
chopped O
down O
Austen’s B-PER
original O
text O
and O
“Fleabag”-esque O
camera-mugging. O
It’s O
an O
unenviable O
task, O
condensing O
volumes’ O
worth O
of O
social O
critique, O
sparkling O
dialogue O
and O
characters O
so O
beloved O
that O
they’ve O
inspired O
an O
entire O
archetype O
of O

interest. O

But O
often O
, O
these O

succeed O

even O
reveal O
new O
layers O
to O
Austen’s B-PER
canonical O
works O
. O

At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
they O
inspire O
debate O
among O
her O
many O
readers O

CNN B-ORG
consulted O
several O
Austen O
scholars O
and O
devotees O
to O
explain O
what O
they O
look O
for O
in O
an O
adaptation O
of O
Austen’s O
work O
– O
and O
break O
down O
why O
the O
magic O
of O
her O
words O
can O
be O
so O
tricky O
to O
translate O
for O
the O
screen O
. O
Why O
we O
love O
adapting O
Austen O
Viewed O
one O
way O
, O
Austen’s O
tales O
are O
quintessential O
romances O
. O
They’ve O
got O
all O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
the O
genre O
: O
Disapproving O
family O
, O
mismatched O
couples O
, O
hate-to-love O
relationships O
, O
long-awaited O
reunions O
, O
swoon-worthy O
declarations O
of O
love O
. O
We’ve O
seen O
these O
tropes O
crop O
up O
in O
nearly O
every O
romance O
story O
since O
. O
So O
what O
makes O
Austen’s O
romances O
so O
ripe O
for O
retelling O
? O
On O
one O
hand O
, O
it’s O
a O
shrewd O
business O
decision O
to O
revive O
Austen O
– O
there’s O
always O
an O
audience O
for O
her O
work O
, O

Over O
the O
years O

Austen B-PER

been O

for O
more O
than O
a O

The O
’90s O
gave O
us O
a O

of O

adaptations O

the O

“Pride O

a O
few O

and O
other O
Regency-era O
stories O
, O
similar O
to O
what O
we O
have O
now O
amid O
the O
enormous O
popularity O
of O
“Bridgerton.” O
Austen’s B-PER
popularity O
spans O
the O
world O
– O
see O
the O
Bollywood-inspired O
film O
“Bride O

and O
China’s B-LOC
“Mr. O
Pride O

Miss O

two O
of O
several O
Austen O
adaptations O
starring O
Asian O
protagonists. O
Though O
Austen’s O
novels O
always O
folded O
love O
and O
marriage O
into O
their O
plots, O
the O
author O
didn’t O
always O
portray O
marriage O
as O
the O
seamless O
happy O
ending O
to O
which O
her O
heroines O
aspired. O
It’s O
a O
financial O
decision O
and O
a O
familial O
duty, O
of O
which O
her O
female O
characters O
are O
acutely O
aware. O
Austen’s O
women O
are O
often O
ambivalent O
about O
what O
it O
would O
mean O
for O
their O
independence O
if O
they O
marry, O
even O
when O
they O
genuinely O
love O
their O
partners, O
said O
Inger B-PER
Brodey, I-PER
an O
associate O
professor O
of O

and O
comparative O
literature O
at O
the O
University B-ORG

“Austen O
is O
a O
way O
for O
today’s O
readers O
to O
both O
romanticize O
about O
soul O
mates O
and O
also O
sustain O
their O
self-respect,” O
said O
Brodey, O
who’s O
published O
several O
papers O
on O
Austen. O
And O
so, O
in O
that O
way, O
she O
said, O
Austen’s O
tales O
continue O
to O
inspire O
and O
empower O
today: O
They’re O
clear-eyed O
love O
stories O
told O
from O
a O
subtly O
feminist O
perspective O
that O
still O
give O
their O
protagonists O
some O
sort O
of O
agency. O
What O
the O
best O
Austen O
adaptations O
get O
right O
A O
strong O
Austen O
adaptation O
doesn’t O
need O
to O
parrot O
the O
original O
text O
or O
even O
take O
place O
in O
late O
18th-century O
England. O
In O
fact, O
Brodey B-PER
said, O
she’d O
prefer O
a O
film O
not O
feel O
indebted O
to O
the O
source O
novel. O
The O
Austenites O
CNN B-ORG
interviewed O
agreed O
– O
for O
an O
Austen O
adaptation O
to O
succeed, O
it O
needs O
to O
maintain O
the O
spirit O
of O
her O
work, O
especially O
her O
incisive O
depth O
and O
incomparable O
wit. O
“What’s O
most O
challenging O
for O
any O
adapter O
of O
Austen O
must O
be O
capturing O
her O
fiction’s O
incredible O
combination O
of O
comedy, O
irony O
and O
social O
criticism, O
along O
with O
genuinely O
moving O
stories O
of O
courtship,” O
said O
Devoney B-PER
Looser, I-PER
a O
Regents O
professor O
of O
English O
at O
Arizona B-LOC
State I-LOC
University I-LOC
and O
author O
of O
“The O
Making O
of O
Jane B-PER
Austen.” O
“It’s O
obviously O
hard O
to O
get O
that O
balance O
of O
characters O
in O
content O
in O
two O
hours, O
along O
with O
the O
requisite, O
satisfying O
happy O
endings.” O
“I’d O
say O
I O
find O
any O
adaptation O
of O
Austen O
to O
be O
a O
successful O
one O
if O
it O
gets O
me O
thinking, O
or O
rethinking, O
any O
parts O
of O
the O
original,” O
Looser B-PER
told O
CNN. B-ORG
Take O
the O
seemingly O
divergent O
but O
thematically O
faithful O
“Clueless,” O
a O
’90s O
retelling O
of O
“Emma.” O
It’s O
not O
an O
obvious O
candidate O
for O
most O
accurate O
Austen O
adaptation O
(the O
lead’s O
name O
is O
Cher, B-PER
for O
one, O
and O
her O
closet O
comes O
with O
software O
that O
helps O
her O
coordinate O
outfits), O
but O
both O
Brody B-PER
and O
Austen O
scholar O
William B-PER
Galperin I-PER
said O
Amy B-PER
Heckerling’s O
film O
is O
an O
exemplary O
version O
of O
a O
film O
that O
modernizes O
elements O
of O
the O
story O
while O
retaining O
Austen’s O
spirit. O

Clueless O
is O
“celebrating O
a O
certain O
kind O
of O
autonomy O
and O
playfulness O
and O
solidarity O
among O
women,” O
the O
kind O
that O
Austen O
took O
seriously, O
too, O
said O
William B-PER
Galperin, I-PER
an O
English O
professor O
at O
Rutgers B-ORG
University I-ORG
and O
author O
of O
“The O
Historical O
Austen.” O
And O
like O
“Emma,” O
“Clueless” O
is O
more O
concerned O
with O
Cher’s O
development O
than O
her O
romantic O
escapades, O
and O
even O
those O
plotlines O
serve O
to O
strengthen O
her O
character. O
Films O
that O
update, O
modernize O
or O
otherwise O
remix O
Austen O
for O
a O
new O
time, O
place O
or O
culture O
are, O
paradoxically, O
“more O
able O
to O
reveal O
new O
aspects O
of O
Austen O
than O
films O
that O
try O
to O
follow O
her O
novels O
more O
slavishly,” O
Brodey B-PER
said. O

Even O
“Pride O
and O
Prejudice O
and O
Zombies,” O
though O
anything O
but O
subtle, O
found O
a O
parallel O
between O
“settling O
down” O
and O
zombiism. O
But O
aside O
from O
the O
rare O
battle O
between O
Bennet B-PER
s I-PER
and O
the O
undead, O
Austen’s B-PER
stories O
mine O
narrative O
riches O
out O
of O
relatively O
mundane O
goings-on O
at O
English B-LOC
manors, O
among O
members O
of O
a O
few O
local O
families. O
“What O
(Austen) O
is O
trying O
to O
suggest O
on O
the O
largest O
scale O
is O
that O
what O
goes O
on O
in O
the O
everyday O
basis O
of O
all O
of O
our O
lives O
is O
filled O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
implications,” O
Galperin B-PER
said. O
“It O
doesn’t O
have O
to O
involve O
big O
things O
like O
fights O
and O
power O
struggles O
on O
a O
grand O
sort O
of O
geopolitical O
level. O

Ordinary O
, O
everyday O
life O
is O
filled O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
complexities O
. O
And O
the O
closer O
the O
films O
come O
to O
representing O
that O
, O
the O
better O
they O
are O
.” O
Where O
Austen B-PER
adaptations O
fall O
short O
Condensing O
hundreds O
of O
pages O
of O
rich O
text O
– O
rife O
with O
social O
critique O
, O
gorgeous O
phrasing O
and O
revelatory O
inner O
musings O
– O
into O
a O
two-hour O
film O
or O
even O
a O
six-hour O
miniseries O
is O
no O
small O
feat O
. O
So O
, O
Galperin B-PER
said O
, O
some O
filmmakers O
focus O
on O
the O
most O
obvious O
strand O
in O
the O
story O
: O
The O
marriage O
plot O
. O
Relationships O
are O
of O
course O
important O
in O
Austen’s B-PER
novels O
, O
but O
more O
often O
, O
Galperin B-PER
said O
, O
the O
marriage O
plot O
is O
the O
mere O
“scaffolding O
, O
” O
a O
skeleton O
of O
a O
story O
. O
The O
meat O
, O
he O
said O
, O
is O
in O
the O
narrative O
episodes O
that O
reveal O
her O
characters’ O
true O
intentions O
. O

Some O
adaptations O
– O
like O
the O
most O
recent O
“Persuasion,” O
according O
to O
many O
critics O
– O
lack O
the O
ambivalence O
and O
depth O
present O
in O
Austen’s B-PER
books. O
“Persuasion” O
is O
a O
story O
of O
a O
“second O
chance O
at O
love” O
between O
unmarried O
Anne B-PER
Elliot I-PER
( O
played O
in O
the O
latest O
version O
by O
Dakota B-PER
Johnson, I-PER
whose O
“bloom” O
has O
decidedly O
not O
“vanished O
early” O
and O
her O
one-time O
partner O
Captain O
Wentworth. O
But O
it’s O
also O
concerned O
with O
familial O
duty, O
conformity O
and O
precious O
independence, O
and O
those O
themes, O
at O
least O
on O
screen, O
often O
come O
second O
to O
romance. O

Galperin B-PER
said O
, O
Often O
, O
Brodey B-PER
said O
, O
films O
“ O
overwhelmingly O
indulge O
in O
romance O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
social O
satire O
. O
Why O
Austen’s B-PER
stories O
will O
live O
forever O
Even O
if O
new O
versions O
of O
“Persuasion” O
and O
other O
classics O
aren’t O
necessarily O
successful O
in O
reinterpreting O
Austen’s B-PER
work O
, O
they’re O
still O
worth O
making O
, O
Looser B-PER
said O
– O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
they’ll O
entice O
new O
audiences O
to O
fall O
for O
the O
brooding O
Darcy B-PER
, O
the O
beachside O
bliss O
of O
Sanditon B-LOC
and O
the O
cunningly O
resourceful O
Lady B-PER
Susan I-PER
. O
“ O
If O
we O
don’t O
recreate O
Austen’s B-PER
nineteenth-century O
stories O
for O
our O
own O
time O
, O
and O
attract O
new O
generations O
of O
viewers O
, O
then O
these O
texts O
won’t O
live O
on O
, O
Looser B-PER
said O
. O

So O
I’m O
definitely O
all O
for O
adaptations O
that O
use O
Austen’s O
material O
as O
an O
inspiration O
, O
and O
make O
their O
own O
mark O
on O
it O
, O
rather O
than O
treating O
her O
originals O
as O
blueprints O
that O
must O
be O
religiously O
copied O
. O
And O
continuing O
to O
spin O
new O
yarns O
out O
of O
Austen’s O
original O
work O
opens O
up O
her O
world O
to O
figures O
her O
books O
didn’t O
represent O
, O
including O
people O
of O
color O
and O
LGBTQ O
protagonists O
. O
“Fire O
Island” O
uses O
the O
loose O
framework O
of O
“Pride O
and O
Prejudice” O
to O
tell O
a O
story O
about O
two O
Asian O
American O
gay O
men O
, O
the O
racism O
and O
classism O
they O
experience O
from O
White O
gay O
men O
and O
the O
relationships O
they O
forge O
in O
spite O
of O
that O
hatred O
. O
Both O
“Sanditon” O
and O
“Persuasion” O
cast O
people O
of O
color O
in O
Austen’s O
world O
, O
set O
in O
an O
era O
in O
which O
racism O
was O
codified O
( O
a O
decision O
that’s O
inspired O
debate O
, O
since O
these O
projects O
often O
don’t O
address O
racism O
within O
their O
fictional O
world O
). O
There O
are O
a O
million O
ways O
to O
tell O
an O
Austenian O
tale O
today O
: O
Plop O
its O
plot O
into O
present O
day O
, O
break O
the O
fourth O
wall O
or O
give O
the O
Bennet B-PER
sisters O
swords O
to O
dispatch O
zombies O
( O
to O
varied O
critical O
reception O
). O
It’s O
impossible O
to O
please O
every O
Austen O
fan O
, O
but O
scholars O
and O
readers O
say O
that O
as O
long O
as O
an O
adaptation O
of O
Austen O
retains O
what O
makes O
her O
work O
so O
beloved O
in O
the O
first O
place O
– O
intelligence O
, O
irony O
and O
, O
yes O
, O
“capital-R O
romance” O
– O
it O

almost O
always O
find O

Families O

By O
June O
, O
they O

no O

When O

they O
had O

it O
out O

an O
expense O
that O
strained O

So O
, O
in O
July O
, O
Hankins B-PER
worked O
with O

he O
did O
great O

Hankins B-PER

Still O
, O
the O

travels O
about O
two O

round-trip O

to O
get O

But O
Hankins B-PER
said O
she O
can O
always O
find O
the O

On O

it O

the O

the O

But O
for O
others O
, O
the O
pain O
continues O
. O

Hypoallergenic O

easy-to-digest O
formulas O
are O
still O
in O
very O
short O

and O
Abrams B-PER
said O
families O
that O
need O
them O
face O
hardships O
. O
Hospital O
dietitians O
are O
scrambling O

track O
them O
down O

As O
soon O

they O
find O

it O

entirely O
out O

certain O
sizes O
of O
it O
might O
be O

When O
formula O

to O
step O
up O

they O
cut O

a O

they O

by O

that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
going O
to O
the O

the O

Robinson B-PER

He O
was O

We’ve O
heard O
it O
several O
times O

it O
was O
on O
the O
motorcade O
. O

I O
think O
during O
the O
speech O
, O
shortly O
thereafter O
, O
he O
had O
finished O
the O
speech O
, O
that O
the O
President O
was O
getting O
into O
the O
motorcade O
and O
he O
was O
upset O

And O
he O
adamantly O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC

” O
Robinson B-PER
told O
Lemon B-PER

“ O
And O
even O
when O
we O
departed O
from O
the O

it O
was O
repeated O
again O
. O
… O
It O
was O
a O

he O
wanted O
to O
definitely O
go O
to O
the B-LOC

” O
In O
his O
first O
interview O
since O

Robinson B-PER

he O
wasn’t O
aware O
of O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
riot O
when O
Trump B-PER
demanded O
to O
go O
to O
the B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC

Speaking O
in O

, O
Robinson B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
Now O
knowing O
what O
actually O
happened O
, O
that O
would’ve O
been O
horrible O
. O
Had O
the O
motorcade O
responded O
to O
the B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC
, O
I O
think O
, O
would’ve O
just O
been O
far O
worse O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
it O
would O
have O
probably O
encouraged O
more O
rioting O
. O
And O
( O
the O
rioters O
would O
have O
) O
felt O
supported O
. O

If O
the O
presidential O
motorcade O
came O
in O

of O
them O
. O
So O
I O
think O
the O

probably O
would O
have O
felt O
as O
though O
they O
had O
the O
support O
of O
the O
President O
, O
” O
Robinson B-PER
said O
. O
When O
questioned O
as O
to O
the O
former O
President’s O
possible O
motives O
for O
wanting O
to O
return O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
on O
January O
6 O
, O
Robinson B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
I O
can’t O

anyone O

in O
that O
position O
, O
wanting O

Robinson B-PER

he O
is O
“ O
so O

that O
the O

did O
not O
turn O
around O
. O
“ O
Had O
we O
made O
that O

I O
thought O
it O
would O

The O

a O
main O
reason O

initially O

The O

O O
If O

that’s O
what O

“ O
They’re O
like O

‘Yes O

so O
, O
her O
voice O
out O

is O
helping O
both O

fight O
the O

then O
also O
to O

Less O

100 O

The O

been O
a O

for O
the O

as O
it O
props O
up O
Harris’ B-PER

while O
also O
shining O
a O
light O
on O
restrictive O

They’ve O
also O
provided O
Harris B-PER

an O
avenue O
to O
show O
the O
skills O
honed O
over O
years O
as O
a O
prosecutor O

attorney O
general O
in O
California B-LOC
, O
providing O
a O
more O

the O

who O
has O
a O
complicated O
history O
on O
the O

“ O
I O
think O

it’s O
clear O
why O

“ O
In O
this O

such O

A O

as O

That’s O
led O
to O
Harris B-PER
becoming O
more O
of O
a O
public O

Harris B-PER

held O
more O

In O
some O
ways O

Harris B-PER

national O

repeating O

for O

advocates O
say O

how O
the O

reverberated O
in O
the O

and O
it O
was O
within O

pages O
that O

learned O
of O

While O
many O
other O
convicted O
witches O
were O
exonerated O
, O
many O
of O
them O
posthumously O
, O
the O
late O
Johnson B-PER
– O
or O
“EJJ,” O
as O
LaPierre B-PER
and O
her O
students O
called O
her O
– O
had O
“somehow O
been O
overlooked O
while O
all O
other O
convicted O
witches O
had O
been O
exonerated O
over O
the O
years O
, O
LaPierre B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
an O
email O
. O
Details O
of O
Johnson’s B-PER
life O
are O
slim O
, O
but O
her O
family O
was O
a O
major O
target O
of O
the O
Salem B-LOC
witch O
trials O
, O
driven O
by O
hysteria O
, O
Puritanical O
rule O
and O
feuding O
between O
families O
. O

She O
was O
one O
of O
28 O
family O
members O
accused O
of O
witchcraft O
in O
1692 O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Boston B-LOC
Globe I-LOC
. O
Johnson B-PER
made O
a O
compelling O
confession O
during O
a O
court O
examination O
: O
She O
said O
that O
another O
woman O
, O
Martha B-PER
Carrier I-PER
, O
“perswaded O
her O
to O
be O
a O
witch” O
and O
that O
Carrier B-PER
told O
her O
she O
“Should O
be O
Saved O
if O
she O
would O
be O
a O
witch,” O
according O
to O
a O
1692 O
document O
digitized O
by O
the O
University B-ORG
of O
Virginia’s O
Salem B-LOC
Witch O
Trials O
Documentary O
Archive O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
details O
of O
her O
story O
were O
sordid O
and O
mortifying O
to O
Salem’s B-LOC
residents O
: O
Johnson B-PER
said O
the O
devil O
appeared O
to O
her O
“like O
two O
black O
Catts,” O
and O
she O
named O
several O
other O
people O
in O
Salem B-LOC
whom O
she O
said O
were O
involved O
in O
witchcraft O
. O
She O
also O
showed O
her O
knuckles O
, O
where O
it O
appeared O
fellow O
“witches” O
had O
“suckt O
her,” O
according O
to O
the O
1692 O
examination O
document O
. O
For O
her O
“crimes,” O
Johnson B-PER
was O
sentenced O
to O
death O
at O
age O
22 O
, O
as O
the O
Boston B-LOC
Globe I-LOC
reported O
last O
year O
, O
but O
she O
was O
given O
a O
reprieve O
by O
the O
governor O
at O
the O
time O
( O
whose O
wife O
had O
also O
been O
accused O
of O
witchcraft O
). O
In O
1711 O
, O
after O
state O
officials O
realized O
they’d O
had O
little O
evidence O
to O
convict O
and O
execute O
or O
imprison O
women O
( O
and O
some O
men O
) O
for O
witchcraft O
, O
they O
exonerated O
many O
of O
those O
who’d O
been O
convicted O
or O
even O
hanged O
, O
including O
John B-PER
Proctor I-PER
, O
later O
one O
of O
the O
protagonists O
in O
Arthur B-PER
Miller’s O
play O
“The O
Crucible.” O
Johnson’s B-PER
name O
, O
though O
, O
was O
omitted O
from O
this O
list O
. O
So O
in O
1712 O
, O
she O
petitioned O
Salem B-LOC
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
act O
, O
which O
provided O
restitution O
to O
families O
of O
the O
accused O
. O

In O
the O
letter O
, O
she O
asked O
“ O
That O
the O
Honourable B-ORG
Court I-ORG
would O
please O
to O
allow O
me O
Something O
in O
consideration O
of O
my O
charges O
by O
reason O
of O
my O
Long O
Imprisonment O
, O
which O
will O
be O
thankfully O
acknowledged O
as O
a O
great O
favour O
.” O
Why O
, O
exactly O
, O
Johnson B-PER
was O
left O
out O
is O
unclear O
. O
But O
LaPierre B-PER
decided O
, O
after O
connecting O
with O
the O
North B-LOC
Andover I-LOC
Historical B-ORG
Society I-ORG
, O
LaPierre B-PER
that O
taking O
up O
the O
case O
of O
a O
long-dead O
“ O
witch O
” O
and O
clearing O
her O
name O
could O
be O
an O
engaging O
project O
for O
her O
students O
– O
a O
real-life O
application O
of O
civics O
in O
action O
. O
Johnson B-PER
is O
the O
last O
Salem B-LOC
witch O
to O
be O
exonerated O
So O
LaPierre’s B-PER
eighth-graders O
set O
out O
on O
exonerating O
EJJ O
, O
petitioning O
the O
Massachusetts B-LOC
legislature O
with O
the O
hopes O
that O
a O
lawmaker O
would O
introduce O
a O
bill O
to O
clear O
her O
name O
. O
Eventually O
, O
after O
three O
years O
and O
“ O
numerous O
disappointments O
, O
” O
one O
state O
senator O
heard O
them O
– O
Diana B-PER
DiZoglio I-PER
sponsored O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
state O
budget O
this O
year O
to O
add O
Johnson’s B-PER
name O
to O
an O
existing O
resolution O
that O
exonerated O
other O
“ O
witches O
” O
by O
name O
. O
All O
that O
petitioning O
and O
bureaucratic O
navigating O
was O
instructive O
for O
her O
eighth-grade O
classes O
, O
but O
LaPierre B-PER
said O
“ O
the O
long-lasting O
lessons O
are O
probably O
more O
important O
: O
Standing O
up O
for O
justice O
, O
advocating O
for O
those O
who O
cannot O
do O
so O
for O
themselves O
, O
recognizing O
that O
their O
voices O
have O
power O
in O
the O
community O
and O
the O
world O
, O
and O
understanding O
that O
persistence O
is O
necessary O
to O
achieve O
their O
goals O
. O
The O
amendment O
adds O
Johnson’s B-PER
name O
to O
a O
1957 O
resolution O
that O
exonerated O
several O
people O
convicted O
of O
witchcraft O
– O
and O
so O
, O
finally O
, O
Johnson’s B-PER
wish O
for O
absolution O
was O
granted O
. O
But O
the O
work O
for O
LaPierre B-PER
continues O
: O
She’ll O
have O
to O
find O
a O
new O
project O
for O
her O
incoming O
eighth-graders O
now O
that O
Johnson’s B-PER
case O
is O
closed O
. O

She’s O
leaving O
it O
up O
to O
her O
students O
this O
year O
to O
determine O
the O
issues O
they O
care O
about O
and O
the O
courses O
of O
action O
they’ll O
take O
to O
address O
them O
. O
Whatever O
her O
students O
choose O
to O
tackle O
this O
year O
, O
witches O
are O
likely O
off O
the O
table O
: O
Johnson B-PER
is O
the O
final O
woman O
convicted O
in O
the O
Salem B-LOC
trials O
to O
be O
exonerated O
. O
And O
with O
that O
, O
LaPierre B-PER
and O
her O
class O
ended O
a O
chapter O
in O

With O
so O
many O
options O
to O
consider O
, O
choosing O
a O
new O
credit O
card O
can O
be O
daunting O
. O
But O
for O
most O
Americans O
, O
it’s O
a O
necessary O
step O
to O
establishing O
credit O
. O
About O
92 O
million O
Americans O
have O
little O
to O
no O
credit O
history O
, O
according O
to O
Equifax B-ORG
. O
With O
scant O
information O
to O
go O
on O
, O
it’s O
harder O
for O
credit O
bureaus O
to O
assess O
the O
likelihood O
that O
a O
person O
will O
be O
able O
to O
pay O
back O
a O
loan O
or O
line O
of O
credit O
. O
One O
way O
to O
build O
your O
credit O
history O
is O
by O
opening O
and O
using O
a O
credit O
card O
. O
So O
how O
do O
you O
decide O
which O
card O
is O
right O
for O
you O
? O
Here O
are O
the O
most O
important O
factors O
to O
consider O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
new O
card O
: O
Is O
your O
credit O
score O
high O
enough O
? O
Most O
cards O
have O
credit O
score O
requirements O
, O
among O
other O
criteria O
, O
so O
it’s O
important O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
your O
score O
is O
and O
whether O
it’s O
good O
enough O
for O
you O
to O
be O
approved O
. O

But O
what O
exactly O
constitutes O
a O
good O
credit O
score O
? O
Ted B-PER
Rossman I-PER
, O
senior O
industry O
analyst O
at O
Bankrate.com B-ORG
, O
explains O
that O
an O
excellent O
credit O
score O
is O
“ O
generally O
defined O
[ O
as O
 ] O
740 O
or O
higher O
on O
the O
FICO O
scale O
, O
which O
goes O
from O
300 O
to O
850 O
. O
The O
FICO O
score O
represents O
how O
likely O
you O
are O
to O
pay O
back O
your O
credit O
card O
bill O
based O
off O
previous O
payments O
. O
Although O
many O
credit O
cards O
have O
a O
FICO O
score O
cutoff O
of O
670 O
, O
it’s O
not O
a O
strict O
limit O
. O
“ O
The O
average O
FICO O
score O
is O
716 O
, O
so O
most O
people O
are O
in O
the O
right O
ballpark O
for O
most O
cards O
, O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
raise O
your O
credit O
score O
, O
Rossman B-PER
said O
the O
key O
is O
paying O
your O
credit O
card O
bills O
on O
time O
, O
keeping O
your O
balance O
low O
and O
proving O
that O
you O
can O
successfully O
manage O
various O
types O
of O
credit O
over O
the O
long O
haul O
. O
And O
that O
can O
take O
time O
. O

Much O
of O
this O
is O
a O
marathon O
, O
not O
a O
sprint O
, O
he O
noted O
. O
For O
those O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
improve O
a O
lower O
credit O
score O
or O
who O
are O
seeking O
to O
build O
credit O
, O
Rossman B-PER
suggests O
secured O
cards O
, O
which O
are O
backed O
by O
a O
security O
deposit O
and O
are O
often O
held O
in O
a O
linked O
bank O
account O
. O
This O
functions O
as O
collateral O
should O
you O
fail O
to O
pay O
your O
monthly O
bill O
. O

These O
cards O
also O
have O
strict O
limits O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
cardholders O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
than O
they O
deposited O
upfront O
. O
So O
if O
your O
security O
deposit O
was O
$500 O
, O
your O
spending O
limit O
will O
be O
$500 O
. O
What O
rewards O
does O
it O
offer O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
types O
of O
credit O
card O
rewards O
– O
cash O
back O
, O
points O
and O
miles O
. O
Cash O
back O
rewards O
pay O
cardholders O
a O
percentage O
of O
what O
they O
have O
spent O
on O
purchases O
. O
The O
cash O
accumulated O
can O
typically O
be O
redeemed O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
check O
or O
direct O
deposit O
, O
applied O
to O
future O
balances O
as O
a O
statement O
credit O
, O
or O
sometimes O
used O
to O
make O
purchases O
. O
Points O
and O
miles O
rewards O
cards O
give O
cardholders O
the O
option O
to O
redeem O
their O
rewards O
for O
travel O
, O
and O
other O
products O
and O
services O
. O
Whichever O
form O
of O
rewards O
you O
choose O
, O
you’ll O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
enables O
you O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
your O
purchases O
. O

Start O
by O
considering O
how O
you O
spend O
your O
money O
. O
While O
some O
cards O
offer O
more O
rewards O
for O
spending O
categories O
like O
travel O
and O
dining O
, O
others O
offer O
better O
benefits O
for O
grocery O
store O
purchases O
and O
gas O
. O
Others O
will O
rotate O
the O
categories O
that O
offer O
the O
highest O
rewards O
, O
or O
even O
let O
you O
choose O
. O
Many O
people O
prefer O
cash O
back O
rewards O
because O
they O
are O
easier O
to O
navigate O
and O
do O
not O
require O
tracking O
purchase O
categories O
, O
according O
to O
Rossman B-PER
. O
He O
suggests O
finding O
a O
card O
that O
gives O
2% O
cash O
back O
on O
every O
purchase O
. O
If O
you’re O
willing O
to O
dabble O
with O
different O
cards O
in O
order O
to O
chase O
more O
rewards O
, O
Rossman B-PER
recommends O
having O
a O
cash O
back O
card O
for O
general O
purchases O
, O
and O
then O
layering O
in O
other O
cards O
for O
more O
specific O
categories O
. O
“ O
Use O
something O
like O
[ O
a O
general O
cash O
back O
card O
+ O
as O
a O
floor O
, O
guaranteeing O
you’ll O
never O
get O
less O
than O
2% O
cash O
back O
on O
a O
given O
purchase O
, O
and O
lean O
into O
categories O
in O
which O
you O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
Be O
mindful O
of O
fees O
While O
many O
banks O
won’t O
charge O
you O
anything O
just O
to O
have O
a O
credit O
card O
, O
some O
rewards O
cards O
will O
charge O
annual O
fees O
, O
typically O
ranging O
from O
$95 O
per O
year O
to O
as O
much O
as O
$695 O
. O
“ O
For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
the O
better O
the O
rewards O
, O
the O
more O
annual O
fees O
, O
” O
said O
David B-PER
Lord I-PER
, O
general O
manager O
at O
Credit.com B-ORG
. O

While O
some O
of O
those O
fees O
might O
seem O
high O
, O
they O
can O
be O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
know O
you O
will O
use O
all O
the O
benefits O
the O
card O
offers O
. O

These O
are O
often O
travel O
cards O
with O
premium O
perks O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
The O
annual O
fee O
might O
be O
well O
worth O
it O
if O
you’re O
going O
to O
make O
good O
use O
of O
the O
airport O
lounge O
, O
the O
free O
checked O
bags O
or O
other O
perks O
, O
but O
not O
if O
you O
rarely O
travel O
. O
Another O
common O
fee O
is O
the O
foreign O
transaction O
fee O
– O
which O
typically O
adds O
3% O
to O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
products O
and O
services O
bought O
in O
other O
countries O
. O
If O
you O
travel O
abroad O
often O
, O
you’ll O
want O
to O
avoid O
cards O
that O
charge O
such O
fees O
. O

Most O
cards O
will O
also O
charge O
late O
payment O
fees O
. O
“ O
Up O
to O
$30 O
for O
the O
first O
offense O
and O
up O
to O
$41 O
for O
subsequent O
offenses O
within O
six O
billing O
cycles O
, O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
Another O
important O
fee O
to O
consider O
is O
a O
cash O
advance O
fee O
. O

But O
Rossman B-PER
advises O
against O
using O
a O
credit O
card O
to O
get O
cash O
. O
“ O
There’s O
a O
separate O
fee O
, O
plus O
interest O
starts O
accruing O
immediately O
at O
a O
higher O
rate O
than O
normal O
purchases O
. O
How O
high O
are O
the O
interest O
rates O
? O
While O
credit O
card O
interest O
rates O
can O
go O
as O
high O
as O
36 O
% O
, O
the O
average O
credit O
card O
charges O
about O
17 O
% O
, O
according O
to O
Bankrate B-ORG
. O
These O
fees O
can O
really O
add O
up O
if O
you O
don’t O
pay O
off O
your O
balance O
every O
month O
. O

For O
those O
who O
carry O
a O
balance O
, O
the O
accrued O
interest O
can O
easily O
cancel O
out O
any O
rewards O
the O
card O
offers O
. O
“ O
It O
doesn’t O
make O
sense O
to O
pursue O
1% O
, O
2% O
or O
even O
5% O
in O
cash O
back O
( O
or O
an O
equivalent O
amount O
of O
airline O
miles O
or O
hotel O
points O
) O
if O
you’re O
paying O
a O
high O
interest O
rate O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
But O
figuring O
out O
the O
interest O
rate O
might O
not O
be O
as O
simple O
as O
it O
sounds O
. O

Cards O
often O
charge O
different O
rates O
on O
purchases O
versus O
balance O
transfers O
or O
cash O
advances O
. O
And O
most O
credit O
card O
issuers O
offer O
variable O
rates O
, O
which O
means O
they O
can O
change O
over O
time O
. O
Many O
cards O
will O
also O
offer O
an O
introductory O
rate O
– O
some O
as O
low O
as O
0% O
– O
for O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
time O
. O
But O
cardholders O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
the O
rate O
can O
skyrocket O
when O
the O
period O
ends O
. O
As O
long O
as O
you’re O
diligent O
about O
paying O
the O
card O
off O
before O
the O
introductory O
period O
expires O
, O
a O
0% O
rate O
on O
purchases O
can O
prove O
to O
be O
a O
big O
financial O
benefit O
. O
That’s O
especially O
true O
for O
people O
looking O
to O
make O
a O
few O
big O
purchases O
– O
like O
a O
vacation O
or O
wedding O
– O
early O
in O
the O
term O
but O
need O
a O
little O
more O
time O
to O
pay O
it O
off O
. O
“ O
You O
can O
divide O
what O
you O
owe O
by O
the O
number O
of O
months O
remaining O
and O
try O
to O
stick O
to O
it O
, O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
“ O
I O
think O
this O
makes O
more O
sense O
than O
constantly O
making O
a O
series O
of O
purchases O
with O
the O
0% O
card O

Overall O
, O
when O
picking O

is O
no O
such O
thing O

known O
nationally O

just O
as O

her O

was O
a O
central O

that O

much O

who O
put O

The O

Those O

sparked O
a O
movement O
demanding O
a O
change O
in O

even O
seeking O
to O
defund O

Police O

some O

whether O
the O

announced O
themselves O
before O
battering O
down O

rammed O
the O

at O
Taylor’s B-PER

testified O
at O

state O
trial O
that O
police O
announced O
themselves O
four O
or O
five O
times O
. O
In O
Louisville B-LOC
, O
the O
controversy O
led O
to O
the O
passing O
of O
“Breonna’s O
Law” O
in O
June O
2020 O
, O
which O
bans O
such O
warrants O
and O
requires O

. O
Almost O
a O
year O

, O
in O
April O

, O
the O
Kentucky B-LOC

a O

In O
September O
2020 O
, O
the O
city O

Louisville B-LOC
agreed O
to O
pay O
a O
historic O
$12 O

a O

. O
It O
included O
an O
agreement O

The O
settlement O
stipulated O
the O
city O
would O
establish O
a O

an O

Researchers O

How O
synthetic O
cannabinoids O
work O
Synthetic O
cannabinoids O
were O
first O
developed O
in O
the O
1980s O
as O
a O
way O
to O
study O
how O
tetrahydrocannabinol O
or O
THC O
, O
the O
psychoactive O
ingredient O
in O
cannabis O
, O
impacted O
the O
brain O
to O
produce O
a O
high O
, O
the O
CDC B-ORG
said O
. O
“One O
particular O
synthetic O
cannabis O
was O
designed O
by O
a O
pharmaceutical O
company O
as O
a O
potential O
drug O
to O
ease O
pain O
, O
Klein B-PER
said O
. O
“It O
was O
found O
to O
be O
so O
strong O

so O
powerful O
, O
and O
have O
so O
many O
side O

that O
it O

Today O

the O
United B-LOC

In O
fact O
, O
the O
first O

“recognized O

synthetic O

seized O
at O
a O
U.S. B-LOC

in O
2008 O

according O
to O
the O
CDC B-ORG

It’s O
not O
just O
a O
US B-LOC
problem O
. O
This O
has O
become O
an O
international O
problem O
, O
said O
Klein B-PER
, O
pointing O
to O
data O
that O
lists O
at O
least O
320 O
different O
synthetic O
cannabinoids O
sold O
on O
the O
illegal O
market O
as O
of O
February O
2022 O

“ O
And O
those O
are O
just O
the O
ones O
that O

been O
reported O

she O
added O
. O
While O
not O
the O
same O
as O
weed O
, O
synthetics O
do O
work O
on O
the O
same O
cannabinoid O
receptors O
as O
THC O
, O
but O
can O
be O
up O
to O
100 O
times O
more O
potent O
because O
of O
the O
way O
they O
bind O
with O
receptors O
in O
the O
brain O
, O
Klein B-PER
said O
. O
Exposure O
can O
cause O
mild O
to O
severe O
neurologic O
reactions O
, O
such O
as O
agitation O
and O
depression O
of O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
, O
even O
to O
the O
point O
of O
coma O

Other O
symptoms O
include O
“ O
sleepiness O

confusion O

incoordination O

inability O
to O

the O
CDC B-ORG
noted O

Psychiatric O
symptoms O
include O
“hallucinations, O
delusions, O
psychosis, O
violent O
behavior, O
and O
suicidal O
thoughts,” O
the O
agency O
said. O
“Other O
physical O

There O
is O
no O
antidote O
for O
synthetic O
cannabinoid O
poisoning O
and O
long-term O
effects O
are O
unknown, O
the O
CDC B-ORG

Treatment O
is O
supportive, O
by O
using O
intravenous O
fluids, O
oxygen, O
and O
other O

for O

It O
has O
been O
my O
dream O
for O
years O
to O
host O
“Saturday O
Night O

Literally. O
I’ve O
repeatedly O
had O
that O
dream, O
going O
back O
decades. O

I O
have O
traveled O
to O
space O
, O
back O
in O
time O
and O
turned O
into O
a O
superhero O
. O
I’ve O
been O
close O
friends O
with O
many O

I’ve O
created O
new O
memories O
with O
friends O

family O

some O
deceased O

I O
have O
committed O
terrible O

And O
I’ve O
saved O
the O
day O

Our O
sleeping O
mind O
is O
a O
private O
theater O
where O
you O
are O
the O
director O

usually O
the O
star O

and O
there O
is O
no O

the O
production O

Yes O

some O
of O
them O
are O
boring O
( O
the O
majority O
of O
mine O
are O
about O
work O

, O
but O
many O
are O
entertaining O
, O
incisive O
and O
occasionally O
problem-solving O
. O
That’s O
why O
you O
should O
consider O
turning O
a O
blank O
notebook O
into O
your O
first O
dream O
journal O

There O
is O
little O
scientific O
research O
into O
the O
benefits O
of O
dream O
journaling O

those O
who O
make O
it O

The O
first O
potential O
benefit O
of O
dream O

is O
that O
it O
may O
lead O

a O
creative O
breakthrough O

Your O

by O
nature O

more O

Your O
dreams O
jump O
around O
in O

, O
make O
leaps O
in O
logic O
, O
accept O
contradictions O
and O
sometimes O
make O
no O
sense O
at O
all O
to O
our O

A O
more O

theory O
about O

process O
all O
the O

sometimes O

when O
the O

Sigmund B-PER

who O

Peterkin B-PER
explained O

They O
are O
useful O

by O

you O
travel O

the O
point O
of O
DVRing O
our O
dreams O
(yet). O
The O
closest O
thing O
available O
is O
writing O
them O
down. O

There’s O
little O
you O
need O
to O
get O
started O
. O
Find O
a O
dream O
journal O
app O
or O
designate O
a O
notebook O
to O
keep O
next O
to O
your O
bed O
. O
And O
the O
next O
time O
you O
recall O
a O
dream O
, O
even O
a O
hazy O
, O
half-remembered O
one O
, O
write O
it O
down O
. O
Even O
if O
it’s O
boring O
and O
doesn’t O
seem O
worth O
remembering O
, O
write O
it O
down O
. O
The O
more O
you O
get O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
recording O
them O
, O
the O
better O
your O
recall O
will O
get O
. O
I O
also O
leave O
a O
scrap O
of O
paper O
out O
in O
case O
I O
make O
some O
scribbled O
notes O
of O
key O
words O
and O
elements O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
. O
Even O
a O
single O
detail O
can O
bring O
back O
the O
memory O
of O
an O
entire O
dream O
. O
Telling O
someone O
your O
dream O
soon O
after O
you O
wake O
up O
can O
also O
help O
hold O
on O
to O
it O
until O
you O
write O
it O
down O
. O
My O
dream O
journals O
have O
evolved O
over O
the O
years O
to O
include O
headlines O
for O
them O
, O
tracking O
themes O
, O
people O
and O
locations O
, O
as O
well O
as O
noting O
how O
many O
were O
“good” O
“bad” O
or O
“neutral/in O
between.” O
I O
do O
that O
to O
look O
for O
trends O
, O
but O
don’t O
make O
the O
bar O
too O
high O
for O
yourself O
, O
especially O
when O
you’re O
starting O
. O
I O
also O
, O
on O
occasion O
, O
will O
write O
a O
note O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dream O
if O
I O
feel O
I O
have O
some O
insight O
into O
its O
meaning O
. O

I O
may O
instantly O
recognize O
that O
a O
dream O
about O
being O
lost O
in O
a O
city O
is O
really O
about O
losing O
a O
work O
file O
, O
for O
example O
. O
Dream O
dictionaries O
compile O
mythology O
, O
psychology O
and O
cultural O
symbolism O
and O
can O
be O
interesting O
to O
look O
up O
reoccurring O
themes O
in O
, O
even O
if O
there O
is O
little O
that O
is O
scientific O
about O
them O
, O
except O
in O
a O
Jungian O
collective O
, O
unconscious O
way O
. O
Just O
remember O
always O
to O
interpret O
a O
dream O
through O
your O
personal O
experience O
. O
For O
example O
, O
a O
dream O
dictionary O
may O
suggest O
a O
dog O
in O
a O
dream O
means O
loyalty O
. O
But O
if O
you’re O
scared O
of O
dogs O
, O
it O
more O
likely O
represents O
something O
else O
you’re O
afraid O
of O
. O
Or O
if O
your O
mom O
owns O
five O
dogs O
, O
your O
dream O
dog O
may O
be O
standing O
in O
for O
her O
. O
As O
the O
great O
myth O

Here O

takeaways O
from O
Tuesday O
night’s O
primaries O
: O
Kansas B-LOC
maintains O
constitutional O
right O
to O
abortion O
Kansas B-LOC
voters O
sent O
a O
dramatic O
message O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
opting O
to O
maintain O
the O
right O
to O
an O
abortion O
in O
their O
state’s O
constitution O
just O
weeks O
after O
the O
US B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
decided O
to O
overturn O
Roe O
v. O
Wade O
. O

Polls O
have O
long O
shown O
that O
voters O
overwhelmingly O
support O
protecting O
abortions O
rights O
. O
But O
the O
win O
for O
the O
“no” O
vote O
in B-LOC
Kansas I-LOC
is O
proof O
of O
that O
and O
signals O
that O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
decision O
has O
further O
angered O
voters O
and O
possibly O
shifted O
the O
politics O
of O
the O
issue O
ahead O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
. O
The O
“no” O
leaves O
the O
state O
constitution O
unchanged O
. O
While O
lawmakers O
in O
the O
state O
can O
still O
try O
to O
pass O
restrictive O
abortion O
laws O
, O
courts O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
have O
recognized O
a O
right O
to O
abortion O
under O
the O
state O
constitution O
. O
The O
biggest O
warning O
to O

many O
of O
whom O
have O
trumpeted O
the O
overturning O
of O
Roe O
and O
backed O
pushes O
to O
pass O
stricter O
abortions O
laws O
, O
is O
perhaps O
the O
turnout O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
. O
With O
78% O
of O
the O
vote O
in O
on O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
nearly O
700,000 O
people O
have O
cast O
ballots O
in O
the O
primary O
, O
a O
figure O
that O
already O
dwarfs O
the O
turnout O
in O
the O
2020 O
presidential O
primary O
election O
. O
“This O
is O
further O
proof O

The O
latest O
case O
in O
point: O
the O
coronavirus O
rebound. O
The O
condition O
grabbed O
international O
attention O
last O
week O
when O
US B-LOC
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
tested O
positive O
for O
the O
virus O
six O
days O
after O
testing O
negative O
following O
his O
first O
bout O
of O
the O
illness. O
The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
said O
Biden, B-PER
who O
is O
back O
in O
isolation, O
was O
experiencing O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
“loose O
cough” O
but O
did O
not O
have O
a O
fever O
and O
his O
lungs O
were O
“clear.” O
The O
President O
tested O
positive O
again O
after O
being O
treated O
with O
the O
antiviral O
Paxlovid. B-ORG
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
had O
previously O
suggested O
a O
rebound O
case O
of O
Covid O
was O
unlikely, O
based O
on O
reports O
of O
cases O
around O
the O
country, O
but O
Biden’s B-PER
doctors O
continued O
to O
monitor O
his O
health O
and O
test O
him. O

Dr. O
Ashish B-PER
Jha I-PER
, O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
Covid O
response O
coordinator O
, O
said O
clinical O
data O
shows O
the O
rate O
of O
rebound O
infections O
is O
low O
and O
noted O
that O
even O
those O
who O
suffer O
them O
are O
still O
generally O
protected O
from O
serious O
illness O
. O
Biden B-PER
is O
not O
the O
only O
high-profile O
patient O
to O
develop O
the O

Fauci I-PER
also O
experienced O

Covid-19 O
. O
Unlike O
Biden’s B-PER
, O
his O
symptoms O
got O
worse O
when O
they O
returned O
after O
treatment O
with O
Paxlovid O
, O
and O
his O
doctors O
prescribed O
another O
course O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
Experts O
have O
been O
calling O
for O
more O
systematic O
research O
into O
the O
instances O
of O
rebound O
to O
understand O
who O
is O
most O
at O
risk O
and O
whether O
the O
standard O
five-day O
course O
of O
Paxlovid O
should O
be O
lengthened O
to O
prevent O
it O
. O
Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
people O
can O
pass O
the O
infection O
to O
others O
during O
a O
rebound O
, O
which O
is O
another O
reason O
to O
try O
to O
understand O
it O
better O

issued O
a O
health O
alert O
to O
doctors O
in O
May O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
Covid-19 O
rebound O
, O
saying O
symptoms O
sometimes O
come O
back O

and O
that O
may O
just O
be O
how O
the O

plays O
out O
in O
some O
people O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
they’re O
vaccinated O
or O
treated O
with O
medications O
like O
Paxlovid O
. O
The O
CDC B-ORG
said O
most O
cases O
of O
rebound O
involve O
mild O
disease O
and O
that O
Paxlovid O
“ O
continues O
to O
be O
recommended O
for O
early-stage O
treatment O
of O
mild O

moderate O
COVID-19 O
among O

for O
progression O
to O
severe O
disease O
. O
Pfizer B-ORG
, O
the O
company O
that O
makes O
Paxlovid O
, O
has O
said O
its O
studies O
showed O
rebounds O
were O
rare O
, O
and O
that O
they O
happened O
in O
both O
people O
who O
took O
the O
drug O
and O
those O
who O
took O
a O
placebo O
pill O
. O
Because O
investigators O
noted O
the O
phenomenon O
in O
both O

A: O
Considered O
a O
game-changer O
when O
it O

, O
Paxlovid O
– O
in O

argue O
that O

“It’s O

They’re O
late O

that O

they O
have O
to O

more O

that O

the O

I’ll O
be O
very O

very O
surprised O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that B-PER
Dudley I-PER
is O
betting O
any O
looming O

would O
be O
“ O
mild O
” O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
depth O
of O
the O

because O

balance O

. O
He O
did O
caution O

that O

two O

The O
most O
immediate O
reason O

According O
to O
Hemley B-PER

one O
of O
Nepal’s B-LOC
major O

its O

“ O

been O
a O
pioneer O
in O
reforesting O
areas O
to O
make O
sure O
those O

As O

“ O

That O
dispersal O
is O
only O

The O
other O
key O
factor O
in O

is O
community O

Hemley B-PER
explained O

Another O
key O
ingredient O
in O

ways O

, O
knowing O
where O
they’re O
living O

can O
help O

Nepal B-LOC
has O
also O
found O
success O
with O
practical O
tools O

like O
predator-proof O
fencing O
for O

lighting O
the O
perimeters O

ward O
off O

Deploying O
compensation O
programs O
for O
farmers O
whose O
livestock O
are O
killed O
by O
tigers O
also O
enables O
better O
human-tiger O
coexistence O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O
Conservationists O
refer O
to O
a O
concept O
known O
as O
“ O
social O
carrying O
capacity O
” O
to O
describe O
the O
capacity O
for O
a O
certain O
community O
to O
tolerate O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
animals O
like O
tigers O
. O
“ O
Understanding O
that O
dynamic O
and O
that O
social O
carrying O
capacity O
is O
a O
new O
area O
of O
focus O
for O
us O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Unless O
people O
living O
with O
tigers O
want O
them O
there O
, O
we’re O
not O
gonna O
have O
them O
there O
, O
she O

Protecting O
tigers O
also O
helps O
protect O
other O
endangered O
or O
threatened O
species O
. O
“Effectively, O
if O
we’re O
gonna O
protect O
one O
tiger, O
we’re O

“ O

Baker B-PER

“ O
but O
the O
toll O
is O
immense O
.” O
Participants O
in O
the O
study O
underwent O
cognitive O
testing O
and O
then O
were O
randomized O
into O
two O
groups O
. O
One O
group O
did O
moderate-intensity O
aerobic O
training O
on O
treadmills O
or O
stationary O
bikes O
, O
striving O
for O
a O
goal O
of O
70% O
to O
85% O
of O
heart O
rate O
reserve O
: O
“ O
That’s O
about O
120 O
heartbeats O
per O
minute O
for O
about O
30 O
to O
40 O
minutes O
for O
a O
standard O
70-year-old O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O
The O
other O
group O
did O
stretching O

balance O
and O
range O
of O
motion O
exercises O
designed O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
move O
their O
body O

that O
would O
help O
them O
navigate O
in O
real O
life O
. O

Folks O
in O
the O
balance-range O
of O
motion O
group O
said O
they O
were O
thrilled O
– O
they O
could O
go O
to O
soccer O
games O
with O
grandchildren O
without O
being O
concerned O
about O
tripping O
, O
or O
they O
could O
drive O
and O
turn O
their O
neck O
to O
see O
the O
back O
, O
which O
they O
had O
not O
been O
able O

do O
before O

Baker B-PER

Importance O
of O
support O
Both O
groups O
exercised O
twice O
a O
week O
with O
a O
personal O
trainer O
and O
then O
two O
other O
times O
weekly O
on O
their O
own O
for O
the O
first O
12 O
months O
. O

Combined, O
the O
groups O
completed O
more O
than O
31,000 O
exercise O
sessions O
during O
that O
time, O
Baker B-PER
said. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
12 O
months, O
cognitive O
function O
had O
not O
declined O
in O
either O
group. O
That’s O
impressive, O
Baker B-PER
said, O
because O
a O
control O
group O
of O
equally O
matched O
people O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
– O
who O
did O
not O
exercise O
– O
did O
decline. O
Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
social O
support O
is O
also O
key O
to O
improving O
brain O
health. O
So O
is O
it O
possible O
the O
results O
of O
the O
study O
were O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
of O
social O
support O
and O
not O
the O
exercise? O
“Well, O
we O
don’t O
know O
for O
sure,” O
Baker B-PER
said. O
“But O
there O
is O
enough O
science O
showing O
the O
benefits O
of O
exercise O
on O
brain O
health O
alone. O
So O
this O
is O
not O
something O
to O
sweep O
under O
the O
carpet. O

And O
our O
recommendation O
would O
never O
be O
for O
people O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
to O
do O
this O
alone O
,” O
she O
added O
. O
“ O
They O
are O
going O
to O
need O
support O
. O
So O
exercise O
alone O
is O
not O
a O
prescription O
. O
Exercise O
with O
support O
is O
a O
prescription O
, O
and O
that O
is O
going O
to O
be O
our O
recommendation O
. O

It O
isn’t O
often O
that O
Democrats O
look O
to O
deep-red O
Kansas B-LOC
for O
resounding O
affirmation O
. O
But O
on O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
when O
Kansans B-LOC
overwhelmingly O
voted O
to O
keep O
protections O
for O
abortion O
rights O
in O
their O

constitution O
, O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
happened O
. O
The O
size O
and O
scope O
of O
the O
result O
were O
a O
shock O
to O
even O
the O
most O
optimistic O
Democrats O
. O
Not O
only O
did O
voters O
reject O
a O
proposed O
constitutional O
amendment O
that O
would O
have O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
strict O
abortion O
laws O
in O
the O
Republican O
state O
, O
but O
they O
did O
it O
by O
turning O
out O
in O
huge O
numbers O
, O
dwarfing O
turnout O
in O
more O
recent O
primary O
elections O
and O
signaling O
that O
the O
issue O
can O
motivate O
even O
Republican-leaning O

in O
a O
state O

President O
Donald B-PER

The O
political O
impact O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
will O
be O
most O
directly O
felt O
in O
the O
November O
midterm O

led O
to O

opening O
the O

At O

four O

lessons O
for O

Michigan B-LOC
prosecutors O
say O
the O
parents O
of O
accused O
Oxford B-LOC
High I-LOC
School I-LOC
shooter O
Ethan B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
exposed O
him O
to O
years O
of O
“chaotic, O
toxic O
conflict,” O
and O
that O
they O
left O
him O
in O
an O
unstable O
home O
often O
with O
little O
supervision, O
creating O
a O
pathway O
to O
violence. O
In O
a O
court O
filing O
Thursday, O
prosecutors O
argued O
that O
evidence O
of O
Jennifer B-PER
and O
James B-PER
Crumbley’s I-PER
personal O
problems, O
including O
an O
extramarital O
affair O
and O
substance O
abuse, O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
be O
introduced O
at O
their O
trial. O
Attorneys O
for O
the O
couple O
have O
called O
the O
evidence O
“extraneous.” O
The O
parents O
were O
each O
charged O
with O
four O
counts O
of O
involuntary O
manslaughter O
after O
their O
teenage O
son O
allegedly O
shot O
and O
killed O
four O
students O
and O
injured O
seven O
other O
people O
at O
Oxford B-LOC
High I-LOC
School I-LOC
in O
November. O
Prosecutors O
argued O
that O
Jennifer B-PER
and O
James B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
played O
“a O
much O
larger O
role O
than O
just O
buying O
their O
son O
a O
gun,” O
and O
that O
there O
were O
many O
things O
the O
parents O
could O
have O
done, O
other O
than O
simply O
locking O
up O
the O
gun, O
that O
could O
have O
prevented O
the O
tragedy. O

They O
also O
argued O
the O
parents O
had O
“every O
reason” O
to O
know O
their O
son O
was O
dangerous. O

What O
the O
evidence O
will O
actually O
show O
is O
that O
these O
defendants O
exposed O
their O
son O
to O
years O
of O
chaotic O
toxic O
conflict O
, O
which O
is O
a O
well-known O
risk O
factor O
for O
entering O
the O
pathway O
to O
violence O
, O
” O
the O
filing O
states O

“ O
The O
investigation O
paints O
a O
clear O

from O

in O
Alaska B-LOC
and O
the O
2015 O
Calbuco B-LOC
eruption O

rather O
quickly O
. O
Typically O
, O
powerful O
volcanic O
eruptions O

or O
the O
1883 O
Krakatoa B-LOC
event O

cool O

surface O
temperature O
because O
the O
gas O
, O
dust O
and O
ash O
they O
spew O
reflects O
sunlight O
into O
space O
. O
This O
“volcanic O
winter” O
happened O
after O
the O
Mount B-LOC
Tambora I-LOC
eruption O
in O
1815 O
, O
triggering O
“the O
year O
without O
a O
summer” O
in O
1816 O
. O
The O
Tonga B-LOC
eruption O
was O
different O
because O
the O
water O
vapor O
it O
sent O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
can O
trap O
heat O
, O
which O
could O
cause O
warmer O
surface O
temperatures O
. O
The O
excess O
water O
vapor O
could O
stay O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
for O
several O
years O
, O
according O
to O
the O
researchers O
. O
The O
additional O
water O
vapor O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
could O
also O
lead O
to O
chemical O
reactions O
that O
temporarily O
contribute O
to O

Anatomy O
of O
an O
eruption O
Fortunately O
, O
the O
warming O
effect O
of O
the O
water O
vapor O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
small O
and O
temporary O
, O
and O
will O
dissipate O
as O
the O
extra O
vapor O
diminishes O
. O
The O
researchers O
don’t O
believe O
it O
will O
be O
enough O
to O
exacerbate O
existing O
conditions O
due O
to O
the O
climate O
crisis O
. O
The O
researchers O
believe O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
lofted O
water O
vapor O
was O
due O
to O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
volcano’s O
caldera O
490 O
feet O
( O
150 O
meters O
) O
below O
the O
ocean’s O
surface O
. O
If O
it O
was O
too O
deep O
, O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
ocean O
would O
have O
muted O
the O
eruption O
, O
and O
it O
was O
too O
shallow O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
seawater O
heated O
by O
the O
erupting O
magma O
wouldn’t O
have O
matched O
what O
reached O
the O
stratosphere O
, O
the O
researchers O
said O
. O
Scientists O
are O
still O
working O
to O
understand O
the O
unusually O
energetic O
eruption O
and O
all O
of O
its O
superlatives O
, O
including O
hurricane-strength O
winds O
that O

of O
Mar-a-Lago B-LOC
– O
a O
thunderclap O
in O
American B-LOC
political O
history O
– O
happened O
so O
quietly O
, O
so O
secretly O
, O
that O
it O
wasn’t O
caught O
on O
camera O
at O
all O
. O
For O
the O
most O
part O
reporters O
didn’t O
catch O
wind O
of O
the B-ORG
FBI I-ORG
action O
until O
after O
it O
was O
over O
. O
By O
the O
time O
local O
TV B-ORG
news O
cameras O
showed O
up O
outside O
the O
club O
, O
there O
was O
almost O
nothing O
to O
see O
. O
Websites O
used O
file O
photos O
of O
the O
Florida B-LOC
resort O
since O
there O
were O
no O
dramatic O
shots O
of O
the O
search O
. O
What O
everyone O
wants O
to O
see O
is O
the O
search O
warrant O
. O
As O
Elie B-PER
Honig I-PER
pointed O
out O
right O
away O
on O
CNN B-ORG
, O
“ O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
search O
warrant O
in O
the O
federal O
system O
, O
prosecutors O
have O
to O
establish O
probable O
cause O
that O
a O
crime O
was O
committed O
, O
and O
a O
judge O
has O
to O
sign O
off O
. O
The O
warrant O
may O
become O
public O
later O
. O

But O
for O
the O
time O
being O
we’re O
only O
seeing O
leaks O
from O
anonymous O
sources O
; O
interpretations O
from O
analysts O
; O
and O
incendiary O
responses O
from O
Trump B-ORG
family O
members O
, O
friends O
and O
supporters O
. O
‪Mark B-PER
Levin I-PER
said O
on O
Fox B-ORG
that O
“this O
is O
the O
worst O
attack O
on O
this O
republic O
in O
modern O
history O
, O
period O
.” O
‬ O
The O
hyperbolic O
, O
man-the-battle-stations O
reactions O
are O
a O
big O
part O
of O
the O
story O
because O
they O
showcase O
where O
GOP B-ORG
leaders O
and O
stars O
stand O
– O
solidly O
right O
next O
to O
Trump B-ORG
regardless O
of O
potential O
wrongdoing O
. O
First O
four O
hours O
of O
coverage O
This O
feels O
like O
a O
“where O
were O
you O
when O
?” O
moment O
of O
the O
Trump B-ORG
era O
– O
an O
era O
that O
is O
very O
much O
overlapping O
with O
the O
Biden B-PER
era O
. O

But O
its O
ultimate O
level O
of O
import O
is O
impossible O
to O
judge O
right O
now O
. O
So O
here O
are O
some O
notes O
about O
the O
first O
four O
hours O
of O
media O
coverage O
: O
– O
Trump B-PER
tried O
to O
manage O
the O
news O
by O
announcing O
it O
himself O
in O
a O
lengthy O
screed O
. O
Trump B-PER
and O
some O
of O
his O
allies O
“ O
have O
a O
long-standing O
habit O
of O
conflating O
legal O
problems O
with O

,” O
Maggie B-PER

said O
on O

“ O
At O
the O

” O
she O
added O
, O
“ O
but O
it’s O
a O
legal O

…” O
– O
Within O
an O
hour O
, O
sources O
told O
reporters O
that O
the O
search O
warrant O
was O
related O
to O
an O
investigation O
into O
the O

Vasculitis O
occurs O
when O
the O
body’s O
immune O
system O
attacks O
veins O
, O
arteries O

small O
capillaries O
. O

The O
resulting O
inflammation O
narrows O

blood O
vessels O
and O
restricts O
the O
flow O
of O
blood O
or O
even O
cuts O
blood O
flow O
off O

causing O
organ O
damage O

The O

major O
roadblocks O

“ O

” O
Digital B-ORG

cause O

to O
be O

” O
The O
filing O
indicates O
the O
regulatory O
headwinds O
facing O
the O
Trump B-PER

are O
“ O
formidable O
” O
and O
“ O
really O
hits O
home O
the O

that O
the O

Kennedy B-PER

In O
some O

Hu B-PER

On O

said O
China’s B-LOC
actions O
had O
matched O
the O

conveyed O
by O
the O

but O
not O
the O
predictions O
of O
the O
former O
Global B-ORG
Times I-ORG

“The O
Chinese O
government O
has O
indeed O
formulated O
very O

successful O
in O

said O
the O

“As O
a O
result O
(of O

on O
the O
evening O
of O
August O

when O
the O
Chinese O

solemnly O
announced O
the O

the O

the O

Another O
popular O

Geng B-PER
Xiangshun, I-PER
said O
the O
public’s O
patriotism O

Hu B-PER
defended O
himself O
in O
a O
post O
on O
Thursday, B-LOC

his O
“heavy O
words” O
had O
value O
in O
influencing O
discussion O
around O

including O
in O
Washington, B-LOC
adding O
the O
“patriotic O

should O
have O
“diverse” O
voices. O
As O
these O
conversations O
played O
out, O
some O
social O

users O
appeared O
to O
rethink O
their O
disappointment, O
with O
one O
writing O
Thursday B-LOC
evening O
that O
the O
decision O

were O
actually O
“wise” O

“logical.” O
“Now O
I O

one O

said O
in O
a O

with O
thousands O

‘Rational O

But O
the O
apparent O
need O
to O
ease O
disappointment O
and O
promote O
China’s B-LOC
response O
also O
highlights O
the O
risks O
leader O
Xi B-PER

has O
taken O
in O
stoking O
nationalistic O

grown O

because O
Xi O
continuously O
uses O

I O
don’t O

Not O

the O

That O
means O
some O

to O

But O
if O
the O
value O

that O

it O

, O
he O
said O
. O

There’s O
an O
element O
of O
this O
brand O
not O
being O
sellouts O
. O

We’ve O
all O
experienced O
it O
before O
. O
You O
go O
to O
rent O
a O
car O
and O
you’re O
handed O
a O
laundry O
list O
of O
coverage O
options O
— O
all O
with O
a O
price O
tag O
attached O
. O

You O
want O
to O
ensure O
you’re O
covered O
, O
but O
you O
also O
aren’t O
looking O
forward O
to O
spending O
even O
more O
on O
your O
car O
rental O
. O
Fortunately O
, O
there’s O
often O
a O
different O
option O
: O
your O
credit O
card O
travel O
insurance O
. O
There O
are O
many O
credit O
cards O
that O
will O
actually O
provide O
you O
with O
car O
rental O
coverage O
as O
long O
as O
you O
use O
the O
card O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
rental O
. O
This O
largely O
unknown O
perk O
could O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
save O
you O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
money O
on O
your O
next O
car O
rental O
. O
Additionally O
, O
some O
credit O
cards O
even O
offer O
special O
perks O
, O
such O
as O
car O
rental O
elite O
status O
and O
discounts O
. O
But O
not O
all O
credit O
cards O
offer O
coverage O
, O
and O
some O
offer O
better O
coverage O
than O
others O
. O
So O
before O
you O
rent O
your O
next O
car O
— O
whether O
it’s O
on O
vacation O
or O
just O
around O
town O
— O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
best O
credit O
card O
in O
your O
pocket O
to O
ensure O
you’re O
covered O
. O
Best O
credit O
cards O
for O
car O
rentals O
in O
2022 O
How O
does O
credit O
card O
car O
rental O
insurance O
work O
? O
First O
and O
foremost O
, O
when O
renting O
a O
car O
, O
you O
must O
pay O
for O
your O
rental O
with O
the O
specific O
credit O
card O
that O
offers O
car O
rental O
protection O
. O

And, O
if O
there O
are O
multiple O
drivers O
on O
the O
rental O
contract, O
the O
primary O
renter O
must O
be O
the O
card O
holder. O
Additionally, O
for O
the O
credit O
card O
coverage O
to O
take O
effect O
in O
the O
unfortunate O
case O
that O
an O
accident O
occurs, O
you O
must O
decline O
the O
Collision O
Damage O
Waiver O
(CDW) O
— O
sometimes O
called O
Loss O
Damage O
Waiver O
(LDW) O
— O
in O
your O
rental O
agreement. O
You O
might O
find O
that O
some O
car O
rental O
companies B-ORG
automatically O
include O
this O
extra O
insurance O
— O
and O
cost O
— O
into O
your O
agreement, O
so O
you’ll O
want O
to O
double-check O
your O
paperwork. O

Once O
you O
rent O
the O
car O
, O
you’ll O
then O
be O
covered O
if O
your O
rented O
car O
incurs O
theft O
or O
damage O
from O
a O
collision O
. O
This O
coverage O
will O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
financial O
responsibility O
of O
covering O
the O
cost O
. O
However O
, O
the O
included O
policy O
will O
not O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
cost O
of O
damage O
or O
injuries O
to O
another O
car O
if O
you’re O
found O
at O
fault O
. O
Typically O
, O
your O
personal O
car O
rental O
insurance O
will O
cover O
you O
in O
these O
situations O
or O
you O
can O
purchase O
separate O
policies O
from O
the O
car O
rental O
company O
. O
You’ll O
also O
notice O
that O
there O
are O
two O
different O
types O
of O
credit O
card O
car O
rental O
coverage O
: O
primary O
and O
secondary O
. O
Primary O
coverage O
means O
that O
if O
there’s O
a O
covered O
accident O
, O
the O
claim O
will O
go O
directly O
through O
the O
credit O
card O
company O
, O
allowing O
you O
to O
avoid O
the O
hassle O
of O
involving O
your O
own O
auto O
insurance O
policy O
. O
This O
will O
not O
only O
save O
you O
time O
but O
will O
also O
avoid O
any O
premiums O
to O
your O
own O
policy O
. O
If O
the O
credit O
card O
offers O
secondary O
car O
rental O
insurance O
, O
you’ll O
have O
to O
first O
make O
a O
claim O
with O
any O
other O
policy O
you O
have O
. O
Once O
the O
claim O
is O
settled O
, O
you O
can O
then O
file O
a O
claim O
with O
your O
credit O
card O
and O
you’ll O
be O
covered O
for O
anything O
that O
wasn’t O
initially O
covered O
with O
your O
primary O
policy O
, O
such O
as O
your O
deductible O
. O
However O
, O
one O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
many O
credit O
cards O
that O
offer O
secondary O
coverage O
switch O
to O
primary O
coverage O
if O
you O
don’t O
have O
car O
insurance O
or O
if O
you’re O
renting O
outside O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
where O
your O
personal O
policy O
won’t O
cover O
you O
. O
You’ll O
also O
find O
that O
many O
coverage O
options O
are O
slightly O
different O
from O
one O
another O
. O

Some O
policies O
will O
only O
cover O
you O
to O
the O
maximum O
value O
of O
the O
car O
you’re O
renting O
, O
while O
others O
have O
higher O
limits O
. O
Many O
policies O
will O
also O
only O
cover O
you O
for O
a O
certain O
time O
period O
— O
31 O
days O
is O
very O
common O
. O
So O
if O
you’re O
renting O
a O
car O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
you O
might O
find O
that O
your O
credit O
card O
coverage O
will O
not O
actually O
apply O
. O
Additionally O
, O
there O
are O
some O
car O
types O
that O
aren’t O
covered O
, O
such O
as O
luxury O
cars O
and O
pick-up O
trucks O
. O
You’ll O
also O
find O
that O
some O
countries O
are O
excluded O
, O
and O
while O
the O
list O
changes O
depending O
on O
the O
card O
issuer O
, O
Australia B-LOC
, O
New B-LOC
Zealand I-LOC
, O
Italy B-LOC
and O
Jamaica B-LOC

the O

Just O
on O
the O

more O

According O
to O
Cech B-PER
, O
the O
population O

enabled O
by O
the O

“ O

As O
the O

which O
Armstrong B-PER
called O
, O
“ O
very O
devastating O

” O
the O
tougher O
the O

“ O
We O

,” O
he O
said O
. O
He O
agrees O
with O
Goddard B-PER
that O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
needs O
to O
be O
protected O
. O
“ O
The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
basically O
is O
the O
lifeblood O
to O
our O
surface O
aquifer O
and O
so O
we O
need O
to O
somehow O
keep O
the O
South B-LOC

running O
, O
Armstrong B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
We O
’ O

seeing O
less O

less O
come O
down O
the O

Lawsuits O
could O
delay O

But O
for O
now O
, O
on O
these O

there O
are O
more O
questions O
than O

can O
they O
do O
for O

to O
make O

that O
it’s O
not O

also O
my O
other O

in O
this O

? O
rancher O
Goddard B-PER
wondered O

It’s O
just O
beginning O

It O
manages O
to O
both O

chillingly O

The O

the O
lead-up O
to O
the O
US B-ORG
withdrawal O
. O
For O
years O
, O
the O
US’s O
perception O
of O
the O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
threat O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
appeared O
to O
vacillate O
depending O
on O
what O
footprint O
the O
US B-ORG
was O
pursuing O
; O
in O
years O
when O
they O
wanted O
to O
push O
harder O
during O
their O
longest O
war O
, O
I O
recall O
being O
briefed O
that O
a O
solid O
hardcore O
threat O
– O
perhaps O
a O
few O
hundred O
key O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
figures O
– O
remained O
and O
could O
reconstitute O
itself O
. O
Then O
, O
as O
the O
US B-ORG
rushed O
for O
the O
exits O
, O
the O
danger O
posed O
by O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
was O
played O
down O
. O
Afghan B-LOC
raids O
against O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
leaders O
showed O
how O
well O
the O
problem O
was O
being O
handled O
, O
the O
US B-ORG
seemed O
to O
imply O
, O
rather O
than O
that O
the O
group O
was O
still O
there O
and O
big O
enough O
to O
hit O
. O
Now O
– O
ironically O
because O
of O
this O
American O
success O
– O
there O
is O
undeniable O
evidence O
of O
the O
problem O
Washington B-LOC
has O
wished O
away O
for O
years O
. O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
are O
“ O
cooking O
something O
up O
,” O
said O
one O
former O
Afghan B-LOC
government O
official O
with O
an O
intimate O
grasp O
of O
counter-terrorism O
. O
He O
suggested O
that O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
not O
the O
only O
major O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
figure O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
that O
his O
potential O
successor O
, O
the O
number O
two O
Saif B-PER
al-Adel I-PER
– O
reported O
by O
the O
UN B-ORG
to O
be O
in O
Iran B-LOC
– O
may O
have O
entered O
Afghanistan B-LOC
recently O
. O
In O
May O
last O
year O
, O
shortly O
before O
the O
startling O
fall O
of O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
it O
was O
estimated O
by O
Afghan B-LOC
intelligence O
officials O
that O
it O
would O
take O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
between O
six O
and O
12 O
months O
to O
carry O
out O
attacks O
in O
the O
region O
, O
and O
perhaps O
18 O
months O
to O
do O
the O
same O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
. O
It’s O
unclear O
how O
that O
timeline O
has O
been O
affected O
by O
Zawahiri’s B-PER
death O
, O
but O
we O
can O
be O
sure O
its O
symbolic O
impact O
means O
it O
is O
unlikely O
to O
have O
sped O
it O
up O
. O

So O
where O
does O
this O
leave O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
? O

In O
truth O
, O
not O
much O
has O
changed O
. O
The O
Haqqani B-ORG
network I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
a O
tight O
hold O
on O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
has O
long O
been O
accused O
of O
strong O
links O
to O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
. O
It O
may O
well O
be O
their O
infrastructure O
which O
hid O
and O
supported O
Zawahiri B-PER
during O
his O
time O
in O
the O
city O
. O
His O
death O
may O
therefore O
accentuate O
any O
splits O
within O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
; O
the O
group’s O
moderates O
may O
wish O
its O
efforts O
to O
acclimatize O
to O
the O
world O
stage O
had O
not O
been O
hampered O
by O
this O
incident O
. O

But O
don’t O
count O
too O
hard O
on O
that O

The O
Haqqanis O
remain O
perhaps O
the O
most O
confident O
and O
assertive O
wing O
of O
the O
group O
, O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
they’ll O
suddenly O
change O
tack O
after O
this O
embarrassment O
. O
For O
the O
ordinary O
people O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
grappling O
with O
the O
impact O
of O
sanctions O
, O
isolation O
and O
the O
struggle O
an O
insurgency O
was O
always O
going O
to O
face O
when O
it O
suddenly O
had O
to O
provide O
government O
services O
, O
it O
is O
yet O
more O
bad O
news O
. O

It O
is O
harder O
to O
make O
a O
case O
for O
improving O
the O
West’s B-LOC
relationship O
with O
Kabul B-LOC
after O
this O
. O
And O
it O
is O
not O
as O
if O
this O
strike O
enormously O
alters O
the O
reality O
that O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
face O
on O
the O
ground O
: O
Their O
brand O
has O
spun O
into O
a O
series O
of O
global O
franchises O
that O
inflict O
local O
terror O
– O
usually O
by O
locals O
on O
locals O
. O
Yet O
they O
remain O
a O
group O
that O
has O
not O
brutalized O
its O
way O
into O
world O
headlines O
for O
some O
time O
. O
Zawahiri B-PER
seems O
, O
according O
to O
one O
senior O
counter-terrorism O
analyst O
, O
to O
have O
become O
more O
relaxed O
and O
confident O
in O
his O
messages O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
referring O
to O
more O
recent O
world O
events O
; O
complacency O
, O
either O
on O
his O
part O
or O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his O
hosts O
, O
may O
have O
led O
to O
this O
successful O
strike O
. O
Zawahiri B-PER
is O
still O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
directly O
involved O
in O
planning O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
operations O
, O
but O
the O
world O
has O
changed O
since O
the O
abrupt O
shock O
and O
seismic O
grief O
of O
September O
11 O
, O
2001 O
. O
His O
death O
is O
unlikely O
to O
halt O
any O
attacks O
that O
are O
already O
in O
the O
planning O
. O

It O
does O
, O
though O
, O
teach O
us O
two O
lessons O
: O
Firstly O
, O
that O
despite O
its O
humiliating O
but O
strategically O
inevitable O
withdrawal O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
US B-ORG
retains O
a O
long O
reach O
and O
a O
long O
memory O
. O
It O
is O
still O
pursuing O
justice O
for O
a O
twenty-year-old O
crime O
. O
There O
is O
a O
resolve O
here O
, O
and O
given O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration’s O
support O
for O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
that O
cannot O
go O
unnoticed O
by O
the O
US B-ORG
’s O
adversaries O
. O

But O
the O
second O
lesson O
is O
darker O
: O
That O
people O
don’t O
always O
change O
. O
That O
, O
even O
after O
the O
ravages O
of O
the O
NATO B-ORG
presence O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
damage O
and O
chaos O
brought O
to O
that O
country O
by O
the O
Taliban’s B-ORG
decision O
to O
allow O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
to O
shelter O
there O
decades O
ago O
, O
some O
part O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
chose O
to O
give O
them O
a O
home O
there O
again O
. O
The O
scene O
still O
baffles O
me O
: O
that O
in O
an O
area O
where O
for O
twenty O
years O
Westerners O
and O
connected O
Afghan B-LOC
officials O
would O
bask O
in O
comfort O
behind O
secure O
walls O
, O
a O
US B-ORG
drone O
strike O
killed O
the O
leader O
of O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
– O
who O
thought O
he O
could O
relax O
on O
a O
balcony O
in O

the O

dismissive O

On O
the O
Taliban’s B-ORG
management O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
one O
data O
point O
suffices O
to O
underline O
the O
group’s O
gross O
incompetence O
: O
Around O
half O
of O
the O
Afghan B-LOC
population O
are O
today O
“facing O
acute O

according O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

On O
the O
Taliban’s B-ORG
respect O
for O
other O
ethnic O
Afghan B-LOC
groups: O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
are O
creating O
an O
“inclusive” O
government O
as O
their O
leaders O
claimed O
they O
would. O
Pashtuns O
make O
up O
almost O
all O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Taliban, B-ORG
while O
other O
ethnic O
groups O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
such O
as O
the O
Hazaras, O
Tajiks O
and O
Uzbeks O
are O
almost O
entirely O
excluded O
from O
leadership O
roles. O
On O
their O
respect O
for O
democracy: O
The O
Taliban, B-ORG
conveniently, O
don’t O
believe O
in O
elections. O
Instead, O
they O
are O
a O
theocracy; O
their O
leader O
is O
known O
as O
the O
“Commander O
of O
the O
Faithful,” O
a O
title O
that O
claims O
he O
is O
the O
leader O
of O
all O
Muslims. O
In O
the O
past O
year O
under O
Taliban B-ORG

40% O

Afghanistan’s B-LOC
independent O

On O
the O
Taliban’s B-ORG
alliance O
with O
al O

Well, O
last O
week’s O
news O
made O
clear O
the O
relationship O
is O
thriving. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
leader O
of O
al O

Ayman B-PER
al-Zawahiri I-PER
was O
living O
in O
downtown O
Kabul B-LOC
for O
months O

with O
what O
the O
Biden B-ORG
administration O
describes O
as O
the O
awareness O
of O
some O
Taliban B-ORG
officials O
– O
speaks O
for O
itself. O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
killed O
late O
last O
month O
in O
a O
US B-ORG
drone O
strike. O
After O

By O
the O

the O

supported O
by O

Why O

plan O
that O

still O

The O
publication O
of O
Haqqani’s B-PER
op-ed O

was O
emblematic O
of O
the O
wishful O
thinking O
about O
the O
Taliban O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
that O
had O
persisted O
for O
years O
. O
In O
this O
view O
the O
Taliban O
were O
just O
a O
bunch O
of O
misunderstood O
backwoodsmen O
who O
would O
eventually O
do O
what O
was O
only O
sensible O
: O
break O

abandon O
much O

their O
misogynistic O
ideology O

a O
quid O
pro O

for O
their O
recognition O
on O
the O
world O

This O
was O
a O
classic O
case O
of O
mirror O
imaging O

the O
belief O
that O
the O
Taliban O
would O
do O
the O
rational O
things O
some O
gullible O
Americans O
expected O
them O
to O
do O

as O
opposed O

the O
quasi-mediaeval O
ideology O
that O

at O
the O
core O
of O
their O
armed O
movement O
since O
they O
first O
emerged O
almost O
three O

It O
was O
like O

“mature” O
once O
they O

taken O

change O

the O

Barnett B-PER
Rubin I-PER
of O
NYU B-ORG

an O
expert O
on O

who O
claimed O

he O
published O
with O
the O
United B-ORG

Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
in O
March O
2021 O
that O
the O

the O
Taliban’s O
quest O

sanctions O
relief O

recognition O

. O
Turns O
out O
that O
it O
was O
Rubin B-PER
who O
overestimated O
how O
much O
the O
Taliban O
cared O
about O
sanctions O
relief O
and O
international O
assistance O

while O
he O
had O
also O
vastly O
underestimated O
their O
desire O

maintain O
their O
warm O
relations O
with O
their O
old O

This O
shouldn’t O
have O
come O
as O
much O
of O
a O
surprise O

since O
that O
was O
exactly O
how O

the O
last O
time O
that O
they O
were O
in O
power O
in O
the O
years O
before O
9/11 O

The O
Taliban B-ORG
hadn’t O
fought O
the O
US B-ORG

Afghan B-LOC
militaries O
for O
two O
decades O
only O
to O
install O
a O
quasi-democracy O

the O
second O
time O

The O
“moderate” O
Taliban B-ORG
2.0 O
that O
was O
supposedly O
emerging O
in O
recent O
years O
was O
a O
profound O
delusion O
that O
gripped O
US B-ORG
policymakers O
. O
A O
month O
after O
Biden B-PER
had O
announced O
the O
impending O
withdrawal O
of O
all O
US B-ORG
troops O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
US B-ORG
negotiator O

the O
US B-ORG
House B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on O
May O
16 O

2021 O

that O
those O

thought O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
would O
quickly O
take O
over O
the O
country O
as O
the O
US B-ORG
pulled O
out O

“mistaken.” O
Khalilzad B-PER
also O
asserted O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
would O
opt O
for O
a O
political O
settlement O
over O
a O
military O
victory O
, O
testifying O
, O
“They O
say O
they O
seek O
normalcy O
in O
terms O
of O

removal O

not O
to O

a O
pariah.” O
Just O
months O
later O
the O
distinctive O
white O
flags O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
were O
fluttering O
over O
the O
capital O

Kabul B-LOC

and O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
began O
implementing O
their O
theocratic O
state O
. O
In O
a O
symbolic O
move O
the O
Taliban’s B-ORG
feared O
religious O
police O
soon O
commandeered O
what O
had O
formerly O
been O
the O
ministry O
for O
women’s O
affairs O
. O

Obviously, O
that O
ministry O
would O
no O
longer O
be O
needed, O
but O
the O
“Vice O
and O
Virtue” O
police O
would O
have O
to O
be O
properly O
accommodated. O
The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
released O
a O
report O
in O
May O
in O
which O
it O
observed O
that O
an O
astonishing O
41 O

the O

other O
senior-level O

on O

Taliban B-ORG
2.0 O
was O
a O
mirage, O
and O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
today O
is O
Taliban B-ORG
1.0 O
with O
one O
major O
difference; O
they O
are O
far O
better O
armed O
than O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
that O

they O
ride O

When O

as O
the O
last O

he O
framed O
the O

as O
a O
way O
of O
positioning O
the O
US B-ORG
to O
compete O
better O

great-power O

“ O
We’re O

And O
there’s O
nothing O
China B-LOC

would O
rather O
have O
, O
would O
want O
more O

this O
competition O
than O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
to O
be O
bogged O
down O
another O
decade O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC

This O
was O
an O
absurd O
rationale O
: O
For O
years O
both O
China B-LOC
and O
Russia B-LOC
had O
hoped O
to O
push O
American O
forces O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
because O
the O
country O

both O
China B-LOC

the O

Russia B-LOC

covertly O

the O

according O
to O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
, O
while O
the O
Chinese O
had O
drawn O
closer O
to O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
in O
recent O
years O
. O
As O
they O
pulled O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC

the O
Americans O
abandoned O
the O
vast O
Bagram B-LOC

which O
could O
house O

10,000 O

which O
to O
engage O
in O
competition O
with O
either O
China B-LOC

hard O
to O
imagine O
. O
You O
could O
practically O
hear O
the O
high O

in O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
as O
the O
US B-ORG
ignominiously O
retreated O

which O
seemed O
to O
herald O
an O
era O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
pulling O

It O
hardly O
seems O
accidental O
that O
three O

Russian B-ORG

moved O
an O

Compounding O
Biden’s B-PER
disastrous O
policy O
decision O
to O
completely O
pull O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
was O
the O
botched O
handling O

According O

released O
in O
February O
by O

only O
one O

before O
the O
Taliban B-ORG

five O
months O
after O
Biden B-PER
had O
first O
publicly O
announced O
the O
total O
US B-ORG
withdrawal O
from O
the O
country O

Biden B-PER
patted O
himself O
on O
the O
back O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
subsequently O
extracted O
124,000 O
Afghans O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC

calling O
the O
operation O
an O
“extraordinary O
success,” O
which O
was O
like O

praising O
himself O
for O
helping O

try O
to O
put O

that O

But O
even O
accepting O
the O
most O
self-congratulatory O
view O
of O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration’s O
handling O

the O
withdrawal O

the O
vast O
majority O
of O

who O
had O
worked O

made O
it O
out O

Four O
months O
after O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
took O
over O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
convened O
the O
“Summit O
for O
Democracy” O
in O
Washington B-LOC
consisting O
of O
the O
world’s O
democracies O
. O
Five O
months O
earlier O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
have O
warranted O
an O
invitation O
to O
this O
summit O
, O
but O
Biden B-PER
had O
enabled O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
to O
take O
over O
the O
country O
, O
which O
ended O
almost O
every O
shred O
of O
a O
liberal O
democracy O
that O
had O
once O
existed O
there O
. O
Following O
the O
Afghan B-LOC
debacle O
, O
Biden’s B-PER
favorable O
ratings O
dropped O
to O
the O
lowest O
level O
of O
his O
presidency O
to O
that O
point O
to O
46% O
. O
They O
have O
never O
recovered O
. O

The O
Biden B-ORG
administration O
now O
faces O
a O
policy O
dilemma O
of O
its O
own O
making O
. O
Since O
so O
many O
millions O
of O
Afghans B-LOC
are O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
starvation O
, O
Biden B-PER
officials O
cannot O
completely O
turn O
their O
backs O
on O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O
And O
yet O
, O
it O
’s O
hard O
to O
help O
Afghans B-LOC
without O
propping O
up O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
in O
some O
manner O
. O
The O
Biden B-ORG
administration O
has O
tried O
to O
ensure O
that O
all O
US B-ORG
aid O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
is O
administered O
in O
a O
way O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
end O
up O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
, O
but O
realistically O
any O
help O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
sends O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
tends O
to O
help O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
remain O
in O
power O
. O
This O
is O
surely O
one O
of O
the O
most O
spectacular O
own O
goals O
the O
US B-ORG
has O
ever O
scored O
. O

As O

The O

The O

Those O

the O

“ O
a O

He O
called O

an O
immediate O

in O

the O

that O

on O
Friday O
, O
Pelosi B-PER
said O
Beijing B-LOC
was O
trying O
to O
“ O

China’s B-LOC

were O
designed O
to O
practice O
doing O
exactly O
that O

That’s O
long O
been O

this O

just O
the O

at O

months O

the O

cannot O
be O
planned O

the O

prepared O
in O
two O

” O
Schuster B-PER

, O
referring O
to O
the O
period O
following O
rumors O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
trip O
to O
the O
island O

He O
said O
the O
outlines O
of O
the O
Chinese O
military O
exercises O
were O
likely O
decided O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
most O
of O
the O
actions O
set O
by O
April O
. O
Parts O
of O
the O
drills O
, O
like O
the O
multiple O
ballistic O
missile O

, O
could O
have O
been O
added O
in O
the O
past O
few O

as O
the O
logistics O
of O
those O
are O
not O
as O
complicated O
as O
say O
, O
setting O
up O
a O
naval O

which O
Beijing B-LOC

was O
one O
of O
its O

the O
exercises O
. O
Drills O
‘ O
to O
intimidate O
the O
US B-ORG

' O
Schuster B-PER
also O
noted O
that O
the O
exercises O
are O
larger O
than O
those O
China B-LOC
has O
organized O
in O
previous O
years O
. O
“ O
This O
expanded O
exercise O
activity O
has O
a O
third O
purpose O
– O
to O
intimidate O
the O
US B-ORG

Japan B-LOC
– O
both O
of O
which O
have O
indicated O
their O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC

” O
Schuster B-PER

. O
“ O
If O
you O
look O
at O
the O

from O

April O

the O

not O

the O
late O
former O

an O

We O

On O
Friday O

were O
“a O

called O

Japan B-LOC

Speaking O
in O
Tokyo B-LOC

Friday, O
Pelosi B-PER
accused O

“They O

not O
isolate O

she O
said. O
She O
added O
that O
her O

China’s B-LOC
Foreign I-ORG

to O

realize O

she O

that O

out O

for O

Gandhi B-PER
and O
Berman B-PER
agreed O
that O
love O

are O
helpful O
because O
they O
allow O
an O
individual O

to O
gauge O
where O
they O

“ O
even O
if O
one O
or O
two O
of O

it O

“ O
No O
, O
not O
at O
all O

Love O
languages O
are O
as O
varied O
as O
can O
be O
,” O
Berman B-PER
said O
via O

She O
indicated O
there O
are O
actually O
many O
more O
than O
the O
traditional O
five O
languages O
. O
She O
said O
she O
feels O
finding O
a O
partner O
with O
the O
exact O
same O
language O
could O
be O
impossible O
, O
but O
more O
importantly O
, O
love O
languages O
aren’t O
about O
people O
learning O
to O
love O
the O
exact O
same O
way O
as O
their O
partners O
. O
Rather O
, O
the O
theory O
of O
love O
languages O
is O
about O
learning O
that O
we O
all O
experience O
reality O
differently O
and O
have O
unique O
and O
sometimes O
mysterious O
internal O
lives O
. O
The O
way O
to O
achieve O
longevity O
and O
satisfaction O
is O
not O
by O
speaking O
the O
same O
love O
language O
as O
your O
partner O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
, O
but O
honoring O
that O
your O
partner O
may O
experience O
the O
world O
differently O
than O
you O
and O
making O
a O
commitment O
to O
seek O
out O
ways O
to O
make O
your O

feel O
loved O
. O
It’s O
about O
bringing O
the O
energy O
you O
want O
to O
experience O
into O
your O
relationship O
, O
rather O
than O
waiting O
for O
a O
happy O
ending O
to O
be O
handed O
to O
you O
, O
she O
said O
. O
Is O
it O
important O
to O
know O
and O
respond O
to O
your O
partner’s O
love O
language O
? O
Gandhi B-PER
agreed O
that O
it’s O
important O
to O
respond O
to O
a O
partner’s O
preferred O
love O
language O
but O
also O
to O
recognize O
there O
isn’t O
just O
one O
playbook O
. O
One O
day O
, O
your O
partner O
might O
need O
quality O
time O
from O
you O
. O

But O
on O
their O
birthday O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
they O
might O
want O
a O
gift O
. O

They O
may O
need O
physical O
affection O
on O
another O
day O
. O
And O
along O
with O
the O
five O
love O
languages O
, O
other O
needs O
may O
arise O
in O
relationships O
, O
including O
good O
listening O
skills O
or O
knowing O
when O
to O
provide O
your O
partner O
some O
space O
, O
either O
physically O
or O
emotionally O
. O
Instead O
of O
following O
a O
love O
language O
playbook O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
, O
partners O
need O
to O
be O
curious O
about O
how O
to O
satisfy O
one O
another O
. O
Vulnerability O
is O
a O
necessity O
, O
so O
focus O
on O
learning O
what O
barriers O
you O
may O
have O
erected O
to O
prevent O
you O
from O
being O
seen O
or O
heard O
. O
Can O
it O
be O
problematic O
not O
to O
know O
your O
partner’s O
love O
language O
? O

It’s O
problematic O
to O
have O
a O
relationship O
that O
isn’t O
built O
on O
communication O
, O
consistency O
and O
shared O
intentions O
to O
protect O
and O
nourish O
your O
bonds O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
. O
“Love O
languages O
are O
just O
one O
resource O
you O
can O
use O
to O
help O
deepen O
your O
bond O
, O
but O
for O
many O
people O
, O
they O
just O
take O
the O
online O
love O
language O
quiz O
and O
sort O
of O
forget O
about O
it O
shortly O
thereafter O
. O
If O
you O
actually O
use O
the O
information O
to O
actively O
make O
choices O
to O
celebrate O
your O
love O
and O
nourish O
your O
relationship O
, O
then O
it O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O
, O
” O
she O
said O
via O
email O
. O
Gandhi B-PER
agreed O
but O
placed O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
utility O
of O
discussing O
the O
five O
languages O
. O
She O
suggested O
couples O
talk O
about O
the O
five O
languages O
and O
understand O
what O
each O
partner O
feels O
like O
is O
their O
most O
consistently O
important O
one O
or O
maybe O
two O
. O

A O
discussion O
might O
start O
with O
, O
“ O
Hey O
, O
I O
know O
quality O
time O
is O
really O
important O
to O
you O
. O
Do O
you O
feel O
like O
we’ve O
shared O
enough O
quality O
time O
together O
? O
Overall O
, O
it’s O
helpful O
for O
couples O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
love O
languages O
and O
make O
sure O
they’re O
happy O
with O
the O
love O
they’re O
receiving O
. O
And O
to O
maximize O
satisfaction O
and O
longevity O
, O
open O
communication O
around O
relationship O
needs O
is O
critical O
. O
After O
all O
, O
as O
I O
know O
from O
my O

practice O
, O
couples O
want O
their O
partner O
to O
feel O

the O

want O

Talking O
through O
the O

There O
have O
been O
plenty O
of O
articles O
written O
about O
how O
his O
influence O
may O
very O
well O
be O
on O
the O
decline O
. O
This O
past O
week O
, O
however O
, O
offered O
proof O
that O
Trump B-PER
remains O
a O
power O
center O
within O
the O
party O
. O
It O
fits O
with O
other O
data O
suggesting O
that O
while O
the O
former O
President O
may O
not O
be O
as O
powerful O
as O
he O
once O
was O
, O
he O
remains O
a O
force O
to O
be O
reckoned O
with O
in O
the O
GOP O
. O
Trump B-PER
- O
backed O
candidates O
swept O
important O
statewide O
primaries O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
including O
for O
governor O
( O
where O
Trump B-PER
’s O
candidate O
defeated O
the O
one O
endorsed O
by O
former O
Vice O
President O
Mike B-PER
Pence I-PER
) O
, O
US B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
, O
state O
attorney O
general O
and O
secretary O
of O
state O
. O
All O
of O
them O
deny O
the O
fact O
that O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
legitimately O
won O
the O
2020 O
presidential O
election O
. O
Likewise O
, O
in O
Michigan B-LOC
, O
Trump B-PER
- O
endorsed O
Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
won O
the O
Republican B-ORG
nomination O
for O
governor O
. O

And O
US B-LOC
Rep. O
Peter B-PER
Meijer I-PER
, O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
last O
year O
after O
January O
6 O
, O
went O
down O
to O
defeat O
in O
the O
GOP B-ORG
primary O
to O
another O
Trump-backed O
election O
denier O
in O
the O
3rd O
Congressional O
District O
. O
Trump’s B-PER
pick O
for O
Kansas B-LOC
governor O
( O
Derek B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
) O
won O
his O
primary O
as O
well O
. O
The O
former O
President B-PER
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
this O
primary O
season O
in O
GOP B-ORG
contests O
with O
no O
incumbents O
or O
those O
featuring O
two O
sitting O
lawmakers O
because O
of O
redistricting O
. O
By O
my O
count O
, O
his O
candidates O
have O
won O
slightly O
less O
than O
90% O
of O
contested O
primaries O
for O
governor O
or O
Congress O
that O
had O
either O
no O
incumbents O
or O
two O
incumbents O
because O
of O
redistricting O
. O
That’s O
a O
strong O
number O
, O
though O
down O
from O
the O
96% O
of O
such O
primaries O
his O
candidates O
won O
in O
the O
2020 O
cycle O
. O
So O
far O
, O
the O
only O
major O
contest O
from O
the O
past O
week O
that O
a O
Trump B-PER
candidate O
lost O
was O
in O
the O
open O
primary O
for O
Washington’s B-LOC
4th I-LOC
District I-LOC
. O

GOP O
Rep. O
Dan B-PER
Newhouse I-PER
advanced O
to O
the O
general O
election O
under O
the O
state’s O
top O
two O
primary O
system O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
and O
had O
to O
withstand O
a O
challenge O
from O
the O
Trump-endorsed O
Loren B-PER
Culp I-PER
, O
who O
has O
been O
in O
third O
place O
. O
But O
even O
Newhouse’s B-PER
advancement O
proves O
the O
point O
that O
Trump B-PER
remains O
a O
power O
center O
in O
the O
GOP O
. O
As O
of O
Sunday O
, O
Newhouse B-PER
was O
pulling O
in O
a O
little O
more O
than O
25% O
of O
the O
primary O
vote O
and O
only O
34% O
of O
those O
who O
voted O
for O
a O
Republican O
candidate O
in O
the O
district O
. O
That O
is O
incredibly O
weak O
for O
a O
sitting O
member O
of O
Congress O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Newhouse B-PER
and O
California’s B-LOC
David B-PER
Valadao I-PER
, O
the O
only O
other O
Republican O
so O
far O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
and O
made O
it O
to O
the O
November O
ballot O
, O
have O
commanded O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
primary O
vote O
. O
And O
both O
have O
done O
so O
in O
primaries O
where O
all O
candidates O
, O
regardless O
of O
party O
affiliation O
, O
ran O
on O
the O
same O
ballot O
with O
the O
top O
two O
vote-getters O
advancing O
to O
November O
– O
which O
means O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
non-Republicans O
voting O
. O

Trump B-PER
’s O
success O
in O
primaries O
this O
season O
shouldn’t O
be O
all O
that O
surprising O
given O
the O
national O
polls O
. O
His O
very O
favorable O
rating O
among O
Republicans O
is O
in O
the O
low O
50s O
. O
This O
is O
down O
from O
around O
70% O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
2020 O
campaign O
, O
but O
it O
means O
that O
a O
little O
more O
than O
half O
of O
Republicans O
really O
like O
Trump B-PER
. O
There O
isn’t O
another O
active O
candidate O
who O
comes O
close O
to O
that O
level O
of O
adoration O
. O
Speaking O
of O
candidates O
who O
aren’t O
Trump B-PER
, O
few O
nonincumbents O
have O
ever O
polled O
at O
or O
above O
where O
Trump B-PER
is O
currently O
in O
early O
national O
presidential O
primary O
polls O
– O
he’s O
at O
about O
50% O
of O
the O
national O
primary O
vote O
. O
The O
non-Trump O
candidates O
to O
have O
done O
so O
in O
the O
modern O
primary O
era O
appear O
to O
be O
Democrats O
Al B-PER
Gore I-PER
, O
in O
1998 O
, O
and O
Hillary B-PER
Clinton I-PER
, O
in O
2014 O
. O
Both O
went O
on O
to O
win O
their O
party’s O
nomination O
in O
the O
next O
presidential O
election O
. O

The O
closest O
Republicans O
were O
George B-PER
H.W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
in O
1986 O
and O
George B-PER
W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
in O
1998 O
. O
Both O
were O
polling O
in O
the O
low O
40s O
and O
would O
go O
on O
to O
win O
the O
GOP B-ORG
nomination O
. O

While O
it O
is O
true O
Florida B-LOC
Gov. O
Ron B-PER
DeSantis I-PER
has O
been O
gaining O
on O
Trump B-PER
nationally O
, O
he’s O
still O
about O
25 O
points O
behind O
him O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
best O
way O
to O
understand O
Trump’s B-PER
standing O
in O
the O
GOP B-ORG
is O
to O
look O
at O
the O
verbs O
“ O
could O
” O
and O
“ O
will O
” O
. O
Trump B-PER
could O
be O
beat O
if O
he O
decides O
to O
run O
for O
the O
Republican B-ORG
nomination O
. O
He O
will O
, O
however O
, O
be O
tough O
to O
beat O
. O

A O
hazy O
picture O
three O
months O
before O
Election O
Day O
Before O
we O
get O
ahead O
of O
ourselves O
with O
all O
this O
2024 O
talk O
, O
there’s O
a O
big O
election O
to O
be O
held O
this O
year O
! O
The O
2022 O
midterms O
are O
only O
about O
three O
months O
away O
, O
and O
the O
picture O
has O
become O
more O
uncertain O
as O
we O
approach O
the O
date O
. O
Normally O
, O
midterms O
follow O
a O
simple O
pattern O
. O
The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
party O
loses O
seats O
in O
Congress B-ORG
( O
especially O
the O
House B-ORG
) O
This O
is O
especially O
the O
case O
when O
the O
incumbent O
president O
has O
an O
approval O
rating O
below O
50 O
% O
. O
Biden’s B-PER
approval O
rating O
is O
below O
40 O
% O
. O
Yet O
, O
the O
generic O
congressional O
ballot O
keeps O
getting O
tighter O
. O

The O
3-point O
lead O
Republicans B-ORG
held O
in O
May O
has O
completely O
disappeared O
by O
now O
. O
( O
The O
generic O
ballot O
usually O
asks O
respondents O
some O
form O
of O
the O
following O
question O
: O
“ O
If O
the O
elections O
for O
Congress B-ORG
were O
held O
today O
, O
would O
you O
vote O
for O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
or O
Republican B-ORG
party O
?” O
This O
is O
unusual O
Often O
, O
the O
challenging O
party O
improves O
its O
position O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
midterm O
cycle O
. O
The O
haziness O
in O
the O
national O
environment O
can O
be O
tied O
to O
what O
voters O
feel O
are O
the O
important O
issues O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
economy O
is O
the O
No O

1 O
issue O

And O
yes O
inflation O
remains O
historically O
high O
. O
This O
has O
led O
to O
a O
decline O
in O
real O
disposable O
income O
per O
capita O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O
money O
Americans O
have O
to O
spend O
) O
Yet O
, O
there O
are O
facets O
of O
the O
economy O
that O
are O
quite O
good O
or O
at O
least O
improving O
. O
We O
are O
tied O
for O
the O
lowest O
unemployment O
rate O
in O
over O
50 O
years O
. O
The O
stock O
market O
is O
up O
. O
Gas O
prices O
are O
down O
from O
their O
June O
peak O
. O

Moreover O
, O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
besides O
the O
economy O
at O
play O
. O
Abortion O
may O
not O
rank O
as O
high O
on O
the O
list O
of O
voter O
priorities O
as O
the O
economy O
, O
but O
more O
Americans O
than O
at O
any O
point O
since O
at O
least O
1984 O
say O
it O
is O
a O
top O
problem O
. O
We O
saw O
this O
past O
week O
that O
abortion O
can O
motivate O
voters O
. O

Democrats B-ORG
saw O
a O
massive O
increase O
in O
voter O
turnout O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
compared O
with O
every O
other O
primary O
so O
far O
this O
season O
. O
Answering O
the O
question O
of O
who O
will O
control O
Congress B-ORG
next O
year O
has O
become O
muddled O
in O
another O
way O
as O
well O
: O
The O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
may O
be O
controlled O
by O
different O
parties O
. O
Democrats B-ORG
will O
likely O
lose O
the O
House B-ORG
, O
even O
as O
the O
national O
picture O
for O
them O
improves O
. O
They O
just O
have O
too O
much O
exposure O
. O
Democrats B-ORG
, O
though O
, O
are O
no O
more O
than O
a O
slight O
underdog O
in O
their O
effort O
to O
retain O
Senate B-ORG
control O
. O
We’ve O
seen O
good O
recent O
polling O
for O
them O
in O
battleground O
states O
such O
as O
Georgia B-LOC
and O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
. O

Those O
same O
polls O
reveal O
that O
Republicans B-ORG
have O
had O
a O
problem O
nominating O
candidates O
who O
aren’t O
well O
liked O
. O
The O
bottom O
line O
is O
people O
who O
are O

an O
exciting O
final O

Toomey B-PER
is O
unapologetic O
for O
opposing O
this O

standing O

the O
way O

He O
explained O
his O
position O
on O

on O
Sunday O

in O
a O
long O
conversation O

“We O

the O

$400 O

is O
wrong O

Toomey B-PER

He O
worries O
that O
by O
switching O
the O
burn O
pits O
fund O
from O
discretionary O
to O
mandatory O

, O
it O
would O
free O
up O
$400 O

the O

you O

on O

last O

It O

filled O

That’s O
what’s O
going O
on O
here O
. O
It O
may O
be O
a O
valid O
gripe O
, O
but O
a O
bill O
to O
help O
veterans O
sickened O
by O
burn O
pits O
while O
they O
were O
at O
war O
is O
an O
awkward O
place O
to O
make O
a O
stand O
. O
It’s O
even O
more O
awkward O
since O
25 O

Veterans O

any O

They O
want O
the O

they’re O
worried O
that O
if O

What’s O
the O
subtext O

Republicans B-ORG
feel O
played O
that O

on O
the O
cusp O

a O
very O
different O

both O

The O

among O

It O

prop O
up O

the O
November O
midterm O

Possible O
ways O
out O
Republicans B-ORG
could O
buckle O
to O
public O
pressure O
to O
allow O
a O
vote O
on O
the O
measure O
, O
which O

plenty O
of O
support O

Democrats B-ORG
could O
buckle O

neither O

“Care O

important O

we O
saw O
what O

so O
I O
hope O

we O
all O
just O
go O
home O
tonight O

everybody O
that’s O
reading O
these O

you O
chose O

you O

Lewis B-PER
said O
Friday O
after O
learning O
of O
the O
jury’s O
decision. O
“That O
means O
being O
present O

moment O
with O
them, O
looking O

eyes, O
giving O
them O
a O

Just O
every O
moment, O
realize O
that O
you O
have O
a O
choice O

your O
choice O

love.” O
The O
jurors O
began O
deliberating O
around O
12:30 O
pm O
CT O
on O
Friday, O
after O
Judge O
Maya B-PER
Guerra I-PER
Gamble I-PER
reminded O
them O
that O
in O
a O
default O
judgment O
against O
him O
Jones B-PER
was O
already O
found O
liable O
for O
defamation O
and O
“intentional O
infliction O
of O
emotional O
distress” O
against O
Lewis B-PER
and O
Heslin. B-PER
In O
an O
emotional O
closing O
argument O
Friday, O
Lewis B-PER
and O
Heslin’s O
attorney O
Wesley B-PER
Todd I-PER
Ball I-PER
had O
said O
to O
the O
jury, O
“We O
ask O
that O
you O
send O
a O
very O
very O
simple O
message, O
and O
that O
is, O
stop O
Alex B-PER
Jones. I-PER
Stop O
the O
monetization O

lies. O
Please.” O
After O
the O
jury’s O
decision O
was O
announced O
in O
court, O
Jones’ B-PER
attorney, O
Andino B-PER
Reynal, I-PER
immediately O
raised O
the O
issue O
of O
Texas B-LOC
law O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
punitive O
damages. O
Following O
the O
proceeding, O
he O
addressed O
it O
again O
while O
speaking O
outside O
the O
court. O
“We O
think O
the O
verdict O
was O
too O
high. O
As O
for O
punitive O
damages, O
Texas B-LOC
law O
caps O
them O
at O
$750,000 O
per O
plaintiff O
so O
this O
verdict O
today O
amounts O
to O
$1.5 O
million O
in O
punitives. O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
will O
be O
on O

today, O
he’ll O
be O
on O
the O

tomorrow, O
he’ll O
be O
on O
the O

next O

He’s O
going O
to O
keep O
doing O
his O
job O
holding O
the O
power O
structure O
accountable O

That’s O
our O
only O
statement,” O
Reynal B-PER
said O
after O
court. O

Judge O
Gamble B-PER
acknowledged O
Reynal’s B-PER
objection O
in O
court O
but O
did O
not O
immediately O
rule O
on O
it O
. O
“So O
we O
do O
have O
laws O
in O
Texas B-LOC
where O
we O
claim O
to O
trust O
our O
juries O
and O
then O
we O
don’t O
trust O
our O
juries O
, O
and O
that’s O
true O
, O
Gamble B-PER
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O
“And O
I’m O
sure O
the O
judgment O
will O
properly O
reflect O
that O
laws O
of O
Texas B-LOC

that O
regard O
, O
so O
don’t O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
that O

CNN B-ORG
has O
reached O
out O
to O
an O
attorney O
for O
the O
plaintiffs O
for O
comment O
on O
Reynal’s B-PER
argument O
. O
During O
closing O
arguments O
, O
Ball B-PER
had O
urged O
the O
jurors O
to O
“deter O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
from O
ever O
doing O
this O
awfulness O
again” O
and O
“to O
deter O
others O
who O
may O
want O
to O
step O
into O
his O
shoes.” O
Reynal B-PER
had O
argued O
for O
a O
far O
lower O
sum O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
jurors O
should O
multiply O
Jones’ B-PER
purported O
earnings O
per O
hour O
of O
$14,000 O
and O
the O
18 O
hours O
that O
he O
said O
Jones B-PER
talked O
about O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC

Infowars B-ORG

for O
a O
sum O

around O
a O
quarter O

. O
On O
Thursday O
, O
in O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
the O

awarded O
the O

$4.1 O
million O
in O
compensatory O
damages O
, O
a O
far O
smaller O
amount O
than O
the O
$150 O
million O
the O
parents’ O
attorneys O
had O
sought O
. O
In O
his O
closing O
argument O
, O
Ball B-PER
thanked O
the O
jury O
for O
their O
decision O
to O
award O
the O
$4.1 O
million O
, O
saying O
it O
had O
already O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
in O
the O
parents’ O
lives O
, O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
award O
enough O
in O
punitive O
damages O
to O
bring O
the O
total O
to O
$150 O
million O
. O
Punitive O
damages O
are O
a O
form O
of O
punishment O
for O
a O
defendant’s O
behavior O

Jones B-PER

the O
head O

stoked O
conspiracy O

He O
has O
since O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
mass O

Jones B-PER

in O
his O
testimony O
that O
a O
jury O
award O
of O
just O
$2 O
million O
would O
destroy O
him O
financially O

But O
on O

out O
to O
be O
full O
of O
surprises O
– O
the O
latest O
of O
which O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
a O
surface O
similar O
to O
a O
pit O
of O
plastic O
balls O
, O
according O
to O
NASA B-ORG
scientists O
. O
The O
new O
revelation O
comes O
after O
the O
space O
agency O
successfully O
collected O
a O
sample O
from O
the O
asteroid O
in O
October O
2020 O
. O

During O
the O
historic O
collection O
event O
, O
the O
sampling O
head O
of O
the O
OSIRIS-REx B-ORG
spacecraft O
sank O
1.6 O
feet O
( O
0.5 O
meter O
) O
into O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
asteroid O
. O
Apparently O
, O
Bennu’s O
exterior O
is O
made O
of O
loosely O
packed O
particles O
that O
aren’t O
bound O
together O
very O
securely O
, O
based O
on O
what O
happened O
as O
the O
spacecraft O
collected O
a O
sample O
. O
If O
the O
spacecraft O
hadn’t O
fired O
its O
thruster O
to O
back O
away O
after O
its O
quick O
collection O
of O
dust O
and O
rocks O
, O
it O
might O
have O
sunk O
right O
into O
the O
asteroid O
. O
“ O
By O
the O
time O
we O
fired O
our O
thrusters O
to O
leave O
the O
surface O
we O
were O
still O
plunging O
into O
the O

Bennu O

composed O
of O

It’s O
about O
one-third O
of O
a O
mile O
( O
500 O

wide O
. O

If O
Bennu B-LOC
was O
completely O

, O
that O
would O
imply O
nearly O

we O

When O
the O

at O
Bennu B-LOC
in O
December O
2018 O
, O
the O
OSIRIS-Rex B-ORG

was O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
the O

covered O
with O

The O

captured O
images O
of O
the O
site O
where O
it O
collected O
a O
sample O
from O
Bennu B-LOC
, O
which O
further O
baffled O
the O
team O
. O
Although O
OSIRIS-REx B-ORG
very O
gently O
tapped O
the O
asteroid O
, O
it O
kicked O
up O
a O
massive O
amount O
of O
rocky O
debris O
and O
left O
a O
crater O
26 O
feet O
( O
8 O

“ O
What O
we O

We O
were O
like O
‘Holy O
cow!’ O
Every O
time O
we O
tested O
the O
sample O
pickup O

in O
the O
lab, O
we O

made O
a O

Before O

after O
photos O
of O

show O
the O
dramatic O
difference. O
The O

reveal O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
depression O
in O
the O
surface, O
with O
several O
large O
boulders O
at O
its O
base. O

The O
sampling O
event O
itself O
likely O
caused O
this O
sunken O
landform O
. O
The O
dark O
surface O
of O
the O
asteroid O
also O
has O
more O
reflective O
dust O
near O
the O
collection O

, O
showing O

were O
moved O
during O
the O
event O

These O
changes O
are O
evident O
in O
the O

When O
analyzing O
the O
spacecraft’s O

the O

determined O
that O
it O
encountered O
very O
little O

Understanding O
more O
about O
Bennu’s O
composition O
can O
help O

whether O
the O
goal O

OSIRIS-REx B-ORG

protect O
Earth B-LOC

potential O
collisions O
with O

rocks O

An O
asteroid O
like O
Bennu O
, O
barely O
holding O
itself O
together O
, O
could O
break O
apart O
in O
Earth’s B-LOC

, O
which O
might O
pose O
other O
risks O
even O
if O
it’s O
not O
a O

“ O
We O

“Most O

“Russia B-LOC

fire O
at O
Ukrainians, B-LOC
knowing O
that O
they O
can’t O

they O
might O
accidentally O
strike O
a O

“That O
brings O
the O
notion O
of O
having O
a O
human O
shield O
to O
an O
entirely O
different O
and O
horrific O
level,” O
he O
said. O
Blinken B-PER
contrasted O
the O
actions O
by O
Moscow B-LOC
to O
those O
of O
the O
US, B-ORG
which O
he O

called O
out O
North B-LOC

noting O
that O
“as O

Much O
of O
the O

she O
spent O
a O

But O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
stories O
she O
connected O
to O
most O
– O
those O
written O
by O

of O

were O
often O
relegated O
to O
a O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
walk O
into O

I O
didn’t O

much O

she O
said O

Yu B-PER
, O
a O

by O

started O

found O
an O
abundance O
of O
titles O
going O
back O
decades O
from O
authors O
with O
names O
or O
backgrounds O
like O
hers O
. O
But O
she O
said O
many O
of O
those O
books O
had O
quickly O
been O
placed O
on O
the O
backlist O
, O
a O
publishing O
term O
referring O
to O
older O
books O
that O
are O
still O
in O

but O
typically O
aren’t O
being O

I O
think O
that O
the O

didn’t O
think O
that O
they O
were O
going O

didn’t O

Yu B-PER

Despite O
this O
, O
Yu B-PER
didn’t O
set O
out O
to O
open O
an O
Asian O
American O
bookstore O
. O

When O
she O
first O
conceived O
of O
her O
small O
business O
, O
she O
dreamed O
of O
a O
space O
that O
would O
reflect O
the O
rich O
diversity O
of O
her O
community O
. O
She O
envisioned O
a O
place O
dedicated O
to O
stories O
written O
by O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
– O
which O
happened O
to O
include O
Asian O
American O
authors O
. O

The O
space O
still O
reflects O
her O
vision O
. O
But O
perhaps O
because O
of O
Yu’s B-PER
own O
Asian O
American O
identity O
, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
her O
bookstore’s O
historic O
location O
or O
perhaps O
because O
of O
a O
hunger O
among O
Asian O
Americans O
for O
authentic O
depictions O
of O
their O
communities O
, O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
has O
since O
become O
a O
go-to O
for O
Asian O
American O
readers O
hoping O
to O
find O
their O
experiences O
reflected O
on O
its O
shelves O
. O
“ O
It’s O
been O
really O
interesting O
seeing O
how O
I’ve O
kind O
of O
been O
pushed O
into O
the O
Asian O
American O
bookstores O
lane O
, O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
that O
if O
I O
weren’t O
Asian O
American O
, O
I O
may O
not O
have O
had O
to O
put O
myself O
within O
that O
slot O
.” O
That O
feeling O
of O
being O
pigeonholed O
is O
familiar O
for O
many O
Asian O
Americans O
, O
whether O
they O
work O
in O
media O
, O
the O
restaurant O
industry O
or O
the O
literary O
scene O
like O
Yu B-PER
. O
For O
so O
long O
, O
Asian O
American O
representation O
in O
creative O
sectors O
has O
been O
scarce O
, O
while O
Asian O
American O
depictions O
in O
popular O
culture O
have O
been O
replete O
with O
tired O
tropes O
and O
stereotypes O
. O
So O
when O
Yu B-PER
launched O
her O
community-centered O
bookstore O
last O
year O
, O
it O
came O
with O
added O
pressure O
and O
expectations O
. O
While O
Yu B-PER
has O
held O
to O
her O
mission O
of O
highlighting O
stories O
of O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
more O
broadly O
, O
she’s O
leaned O
into O
customers’ O
demand O
for O
books O
by O
Asian O
American O
authors O
. O
Most O
of O
her O
inventory O
now O
skews O
toward O
Asian O
American O
books O
, O
she O
said O
– O
making O
Yu B-PER

Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
a O
rare O
and O
special O
place O
. O
“ O
As O
someone O
who’s O
thinking O
about O

Extreme O
weather O
on O
both O
ends O
of O
the O
spectrum O
has O
thrashed O
parts O

the O
US B-LOC
over O
the O
past O
week O
– O
one O
of O
the O
many O
signals O
that O
climate O
change O
is O
here O
now O
, O
scientists O
say O
. O
On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
overwhelming O
rainfall O
triggered O
two O
ultra-rare O
floods O
last O
week O
, O
one O
in O
the O
St B-LOC

Louis B-LOC
area O
and O
another O
in O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
that O
has O
left O
dozens O
dead O
or O
missing O
. O
On O
the O
other O
, O
a O
fiery O
drought O
has O
fueled O
California’s B-LOC
largest O
wildfire O
of O
the O
year O
so O
far O
– O
the O
McKinney B-LOC
Fire I-LOC
– O
which O
burned O
so O
hot O
over O
the O
weekend O
that O
massive O
pyrocumulus O
clouds O
erupted O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
. O
Expect O
more O
of O
these O
extremes O
as O
the O
planet O
warms O
, O
said O
Kevin B-PER
Reed I-PER
, O
a O
climate O
scientist O
at O
Stony B-ORG
Brook I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
and O
prepare O
for O
them O
. O

“Every O
weather O
event O
has O
some O
flavor O
of O
climate O
change O
in O
it O
because O
it’s O
impossible O
to O
decouple O
them,” O
Reed B-PER
told O
CNN. B-ORG
“It’s O
another O
sign O
that O
climate O
change O
is O
here. O
It’s O
not O
just O
a O
challenge O
for O
the O
next O
400 O
years O
from O
now O
or O
50 O
years O
from O
now; O
in O
reality, O
it’s O
something O
that O
we O
need O
to O
rapidly O
adjust O
to, O
adapt O
to O
and O
become O
more O
resilient O
to O
now.” O
Climate O
experts O
anticipate O
heavy O
rain O
events O
to O
increase O
in O
intensity O
and O
frequency O
as O
the O
planet O
warms, O
since O
warmer O
air O
can O
hold O
more O
moisture. O
That O
concept O
is O
easier O
for O
most O
people O
to O
grasp O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
hurricane, O
Reed B-PER
said. O
For O
instance, O
Hurricane O
Harvey O
in O
2017 O
dumped O
more O
than O
60 O
inches O
of O
rain O
in O
parts O
of O
Texas B-LOC
and O
slammed O
the O
coast O
with O
an O
8-foot O
storm O
surge. O
Scientists O
have O
said O
climate O
change O
made O
Harvey’s O
rainfall O
more O
extreme. O
But O
that O
same O
process O
plays O
out O
over O
land O
as O
water O
evaporates O
from O
the O
soil, O
grass, O
crops O
and O
forests. O

And O
more O
moisture O
can O
be O
drawn O
out O
of O
soil O
and O
vegetation O
the O
warmer O
it O
gets O
. O
“Part O
of O
that O
is O
the O
general O
circulation O
of O
the O
atmosphere-ocean O
system O
which O
moves O
air O
around O
the O
world O
and O
brings O
moisture O
into O
areas O
over O
land O
,” O
Reed B-PER
said O
. O
“Another O
aspect O
is O
that O
, O
over O
the O
last O
100 O
plus O
years O
, O
the O
land O
surface O
has O
actually O
warmed O
more O
than O
the O
ocean O
, O
so O
the O
largest O
signal O
that O
we’re O
actually O
seeing O
in O
surface O
temperature O
is O
occurring O
overland O
, O
and O
inland O
as O
well O
. O
What O
it O
adds O
up O
to O
is O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
dangerous O
flooding O
. O
“While O
extreme O
events O
and O
floods O
have O
sort O
of O
always O
been O
a O
part O
of O
a O
climate O
cycle O
, O
they O
can O
get O
more O
frequent O
and O
they O
can O
be O
a O

more O
intense O

hand O

Friesen B-PER
said O
the O
most O
powerful O
moment O
inside O
the O
courtroom O
was O
watching O
Jesse B-PER
Lewis I-PER
’ O
mom O
Scarlett B-PER
Lewis I-PER
give O
her O
testimony O
and O
speak O
directly O
to O
Jones B-PER
. O
“ O
I O
think O
it O
will O
stay O
with O
pretty O
much O
everyone O
there O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
lives O
, O
” O
Friesen B-PER
said O
. O

The O
co-hosts O
have O
been O
covering O
Jones B-PER
since O
2017 O
, O
watching O
his O
transformation O
from O
a O
seemingly O
untouchable O
figure O
to O
one O
that O
is O
now O
in O
serious O
legal O
and O
financial O
jeopardy O
. O
“ O
During O
this O
whole O
stretch O
of O
time O
, O
his O
content O
itself O
has O
been O
essentially O
hollow O
, O
Friesen B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Watching O
him O
from O
my O
perspective O
has O
gotten O
a O
lot O
less O
interesting O
. O
But O
despite O
Jones’ B-PER
legal O
woes O
, O
Holmes B-PER
said O
that O
the O
culture O
he’s O
helped O
engender O
has O
gotten O
a O
lot O
bigger O
. O
“ O
Conspiracy O
culture O
is O
something O
that O
is O
created O
through O
the O
cracks O
of O
our O
regular O
society O
, O
Holmes B-PER
said O
. O
And O
although O
their O
podcast O
focuses O
on O
scrutinizing O
Jones B-PER
and O
his O
tactics O
, O
Holmes B-PER
said O
the O
trial O
was O
really O
about O
the O
victims O
. O
“ O
People O
would O
like O
to O
focus O
on O
Alex B-PER
being O
kind O
of O
a O
bombastic O
character O
that O
we O
can O
mock O
and O
make O
fun O
of O
, O
but O
this O
isn’t O
about O
him O
, O
Holmes B-PER
said O
. O
The O
podcast O
format O
allows O
the O
hosts O
to O
go O
beyond O
Jones B-PER
as O
a O
character O
and O
dive O
into O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
what O
he’s O
doing O
and O
why O
these O
conspiracy O
narratives O
exist O
. O

We O
approach O
it O
with O
the O
understanding O
that O
it’s O
a O
serious O
topic O
, O
” O
Friesen B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
But O
also O
that O
in O
order O
to O
make O
it O
interesting O
for O
anybody O
to O
listen O
to O
, O
we O
have O
to O
make O
it O
make O
something O
entertaining O
. O
” O
Friesen B-PER
has O
listened O
to O
countless O
hours O
of O
Jones’ B-PER
program O
, O
and O
calls O
it O
an O
“ O
incredibly O
boring O
experience O
. O
“ O
The O
reason O
that O
I O
do O
this O
is O
because O
I O
can O
stomach O
that O
boredom O
, O
” O
Friesen B-PER
said O
. O
He O
endures O
the O
task O
in O
order O
to O
help O
others O
get O
insights O
into O
the O
misinformation O
phenomenon O
. O
“ O
So O
they O
could O
be O
in O
a O
place O
where O
they O
could O
better O
understand O
what O
Alex B-PER
is O
doing O
and O
what O
he O
brings O
to O
the O
table O
. O
” O
Many O
hope O
that O
the O
legal O
and O
financial O
jeopardy O
Jones’ B-PER
is O
now O
facing O
will O
help O
curtail O
misinformation O
and O
conspiracy O
culture O
. O
But O
Friesen B-PER
isn’t O
convinced O
it O
will O
be O
a O
severe O
blow O
. O
“ O
The O
conspiracy O
producers O
and O
people O
who O
engage O
in O
the O
sorts O
of O
conduct O
that O
Alex B-PER
does O
end O
up O

” O
Friesen B-PER

“ O

Rudolph B-PER
initially O

an O

Private O
astronaut O
missions O
to O

International B-LOC
Space I-LOC
Station I-LOC
will O
have O
to O
be O
chaperoned O
by O
a O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
, O
per O
new O
proposed O
requirements O
from O
the O
US B-LOC
space O
agency O
NASA B-ORG
posted O
a O
public O
notice O
online O
on O
Tuesday O
that O
laid O
out O
a O
handful O
of O
updated O
requirements O
for O
future O
private O
astronaut O
missions O
, O
which O
the O
agency O
said O
are O
based O
on O
lessons O
learned O
upon O
completion O
of O
the O
first O
private O
astronaut O
mission O
to O
the O
ISS O
that O
took O
place O
last O
April O
. O
The O
first O
all-private O
mission O
to O
the O
orbiting O
laboratory O
was O
a O
multi-million O
dollar O
journey O
organized O
by O
Texas-based O
startup O
Axiom B-ORG
Space I-ORG
and O
launched O
via O
a O
SpaceX B-ORG
rocket O
, O
with O
a O
crew O
comprised O
of O
a O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
and O
current O
Axiom B-ORG
Space I-ORG
employee O
, O
Michael B-PER
López-Alegría I-PER
, O
and O
three O
ultra-wealthy O
paying O
crewmembers O
. O
During O
the O
mission O
, O
dubbed O
AX-1 O
, O
the O
four-member O
crew O
spent O
nearly O
two O
weeks O
off O
of O
Earth’s O
surface O
, O
at O
least O
in O
part O
conducting O
experiments O
and O
other O
scientific O
work O
. O
Other O
space O
tourism O
companies O
like O
Blue B-ORG
Origin I-ORG
or O
Virgin B-ORG
Galactic I-ORG
only O
offer O
customers O
short O
trips O
that O
allow O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
microgravity O
. O
Among O
the O
most O
notable O
new O
policies O
for O
these O
pricey O
, O
private O
missions O
to O
the O
ISS O
is O
that O
“upcoming O
private O
astronaut O
missions O
include O
a O
former O
flown O
NASA B-ORG
(U.S.) O
government O
astronaut O
as O
the O
mission O
commander O
, O
according O
to O
the O
NASA B-ORG
update O
. O
The O
requirement O
is O
still O
being O
finalized O
, O
NASA B-ORG
added O
, O
but O
the O
agency O
noted O
that O
having O
a O
former O
, O
legitimate O
astronaut O
“provides O
experienced O
guidance O
for O
the O
private O
astronauts O
during O
pre-flight O
preparation O
through O
mission O
execution O
.” O
The O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
also O
“provides O
a O
link O
” O
between O
residents O
on O
the O
ISS O
and O
the O
private O
astronauts O
, O
which O
the O
agency O
said O
“reduces O
risk O
” O
to O
ISS O
operations O
and O
safety O
. O
Late O
last O
year O
, O
SpaceX B-ORG
launched O
the O
Inspiration4 O
mission O
, O
which O
was O
bankrolled O
by O
billionaire O
Jared B-PER
Isaacman I-PER
and O
had O
a O
four-person O
crew O
composed O
entirely O
of O
people O
without O
any O
prior O
spaceflight O
experience O
. O
This O
private O
mission O
, O
however O
, O
simply O
took O
a O
three-day O
spin O
around O
Earth B-LOC
in O
a O
SpaceX B-ORG
dragon O
capsule O
and O
did O
not O
dock O
at O
the O
ISS O
. O
Axiom B-ORG
has O
already O
stated O
that O
its O
second O
private O
astronaut O
mission O
to O
the O
ISS O
, O
dubbed O
AX-2 O
and O
expected O
to O
launch O
next O
year O
, O
will O
have O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
Peggy B-PER
Whitson I-PER
as O
a O
mission O
commander O
. O
During O
remarks O
at O
the O
annual O
International B-LOC
Space I-LOC
Station I-LOC
Research O
and O
Development O
Conference O
last O
week O
, O
López-Alegría B-PER
spoke O
about O
how O
he O
became O
mission O
commander O
for O
the O
AX-1 O
flight O
, O
saying O
he O
initially O
didn’t O
expect O
to O
return O
to O
space O
after O
retiring O
from O
NASA B-ORG
. O
When O
Axiom B-ORG
was O
looking O
for O
customers O
, O
however O
, O
“It O
became O
pretty O
clear O
, O

customers O
really O
didn’t O
want O
to O
fly O
with O
nobody O
who’d O
done O
it O
before,” O
he O
said. O
It O
also O
became O
apparent, O
he O
said, O
“NASA B-ORG
was O
a O
lot O
more O
comfortable O
having O
someone O
who’d O
been O
there O
before.” O
“We O
were O
having O
a O
meeting O
and O
we O
looked O
around O
the O
room O
and O
I O
was O
the O
only O
guy O
who’d O
been O
to O
space, O
so O
I O
raised O
my O
hand. O
I O
volunteered,” O
López-Alegría B-PER
quipped O
at O
the O
conference. O

NASA B-ORG
is O
also O
adding O
additional O
requirements O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
result O
of O
new O
information O
learned O
from O
the O
AX-1 O
mission O
. O
Future O
private O
missions O
to O
the O
space O
station O
will O
include O
more O
time O
for O
“microgravity O
adaptation,” O
as O
the O
floating O
environment O
of O
the O
ISS O
can O
often O
induce O
space O
sickness, O
which O
is O
akin O
to O
motion O
sickness. O
The O
federal O
space O
agency O
will O
also O
be O
introducing O
clarifications O
to O
the O
ISS O
code O
of O
conduct O
for O
commercial O
visitors, O
requirements O
for O
more O
detailed O
plans O
regarding O
crew O
interactions O
with O
the O
media, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
requirement O
for O
additional O
time O
to O
evaluate O
research O
proposals O
before O
they O
are O
brought O
on O
board. O

Larry B-PER
Connor I-PER
, O
an O
AX-1 O
crewmember O
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
April O
that O
he O
and O
his O
crewmates O
were O
pressed O
for O
research O
time O
on O
the O
ISS O
. O
“ O
If O
it O
were O
not O
for O
the O
NASA’s B-ORG

have O
been O
able O
to O
accomplish O
all O
of O
our O
objectives O
, O
” O
Connor B-PER
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O

We O
underestimated O
the O
time O
on O
some O
of O
the O
projects O
. O

We O
had O
one O
project O
early O

we O
thought O

did O
not O
immediately O
respond O
to O
CNN B-ORG
Business’ O
request O
for O
further O
comment O
on O
the O
new O
requirements O
. O
They O
come O
, O
however O
, O
as O
the O
private O
spaceflight O
industry O
has O
officially O
lifted O
off O
after O
decades O
of O
people O
largely O
having O
to O
rely O
on O
government O
agencies O
and O
the O
extraordinarily O
selective O
astronaut O
hiring O
process O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
space O
. O

Now O
, O
those O
who O
seek O
to O
leave O
Earth’s B-LOC
surface O
simply O
must O
have O
the O
means O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O
While O
Axiom B-ORG
did O
not O
publicly O
disclose O
how O
much O
its O
first O
cohort O
of O
private O
astronauts O
shelled O
out O

the O

I’ve O

three O

I O

lifted O
up O
off O
the O

as O
they O
washed O
down O

it O
ripped O

apart.” O
And O
he O
worries O
that O
this O

won’t O
be O
the O
last. O
“I O
believe O
you’re O
seeing O

said. O
“Just O

if O

around, O
just O

it’s O
going O

Some O
are O
also O
concerned O
that O
people O
will O
leave O
the O
area O
because O
the O
devastation O
is O
too O
extreme. O
“This O

literally O
the O

Clink B-PER
sighed, O
“These O
people, O
you’ll O

decent O

it O

“If O

really O
the O

was O
a O

this O

can O
