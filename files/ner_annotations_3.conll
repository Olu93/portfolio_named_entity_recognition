– O

the O

has O
made O
the O

through O
expanded O

during O
the O

about O
5,800 O

in O
the O
US B-ORG
. O
Tpoxx B-MISC
was O
FDA-approved O
in O
2018 O
as O
the O
first O
drug O
to O
treat O
smallpox O
, O
a O
virus O
in O
the O
same O
family O
as O
monkeypox O
. O
The O
World B-ORG
Health I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
declared O
smallpox O
eradicated O
in O
1980 O
, O
but O
concerns O
that O
the O
virus O
could O
be O
weaponized O
drove O
the O
US B-ORG
government O
to O
stockpile O
more O
than O
1.7 O
million O
courses O
of O
the O
drug O
in O
case O
of O
a O
bioterrorism O
event O

Tpoxx B-MISC
is O
approved O
in O
the O
European B-LOC
Union I-LOC
to O
treat O
monkeypox O
as O
well O
as O
smallpox O
. O
It O
can O
be O
taken O
intravenously O
or O
more O
commonly O
as O
an O
oral O
pill O
. O
Tpoxx B-MISC
is O
considered O
experimental O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
monkeypox O
treatment O
because O
there’s O
no O
data O
to O
prove O
its O
effectiveness O
against O
the O
disease O
in O
humans O
. O
Its O
safety O
was O
assessed O
in O
healthy O
humans O
before O
its O
FDA B-ORG
approval O
for O
smallpox O
, O
and O
its O
effectiveness O
has O
been O
tested O
in O
animals O
infected O
with O
viruses O
related O
to O
smallpox O
, O
including O
monkeypox O
. O
As O
the O
ongoing O
outbreak O
increases O
demand O
for O
the O
drug O
, O
the O
FDA B-ORG
and O
CDC B-ORG
recently O
eased O
some O
of O
the O
administrative O
requirements O
that O
health O
care O
providers O
face O
when O
requesting O
access O
. O

However O
, O
doctors O
across O
the O
country O
suggest O
that O
significant O
barriers O
remain O
, O
causing O
some O
patients O
to O
wait O
days O
for O
shipments O
or O
travel O
to O
find O
medical O
centers O
that O
can O
provide O
the O
product O
at O
all O

“ O
Patients O

even O
going O
out O

His O

the O

all O

Health O

The O
CDC B-ORG
says O
doctors O
may O
want O
to O
use O
Tpoxx O
for O
people O
who O
have O
monkeypox O
symptoms O
in O
particularly O
hazardous O
areas O
like O
the O
eyes O
, O
mouth O
, O
genitals O
or O
anus O
. O
It O
may O
also O
be O
used O
in O
people O
with O
severe O
symptoms O
like O
sepsis O
or O
brain O
inflammation O
, O
or O
in O
people O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
severe O
illness O
, O
including O
those O
with O
weakened O
immune O
systems O
because O
of O

HIV/AIDS B-MISC

those O

Many O

gotten O
sick O
during O
the O

have O
had O
mild O

have O
recovered O
without O

but O
some O

say O
they’ve O
seen O
more O

than O
they O
expected O
