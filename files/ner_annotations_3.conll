Blinken B-PER
said O

It’s O
now O
“up O

We’re O
still O
open O

having O
our O

seriously O

positively O
considered O
, O
and O
if O
on O
the O
Russian B-LOC

that O
means O
they O
feel O

they’re O
more O

do O
that O
, O
then O
so O
be O
it O
, O

told O

Kirby B-PER

the O

said O

Defense O
asked O
for O
leniency O
in O
closing O
arguments O
The O
court O
hearing O
Thursday O
began O
shortly O
after O
Griner B-PER
arrived O
in O
handcuffs O
, O
escorted O
by O
Russian B-LOC
officers O
into O
the O
defendant’s O
cage O

Once O
uncuffed O
, O
she O
spoke O
with O
her O
legal O
team O
and O
then O
held O
up O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
UMMC B-ORG
Ekaterinburg B-LOC
basketball O

, O
the O
Russian B-LOC
squad O
she O
played O
for O
during O
the O
WNBA O
offseason O
. O

In O
closing O
arguments O
, O
Blagovolina B-PER
argued O
that O
Griner B-PER
never O
used O
marijuana O
in O
Russia B-LOC
and O
that O
she O
never O
had O
the O
intention O
of O
doing O
so O
. O

She O
had O
no O
need O
to O
bring O
the O
vape O
cartridges O
to O
Russia B-LOC
, O
the O
lawyer O
added O
. O

All O
this O
confirms O
the O
complete O
absence O
of O
intent O
in O
her O
actions O
, O
Blagovolina B-PER
argued O
. O

Even O
if O
Griner O
ever O
used O
medical O
marijuana O
, O
it O
was O
only O
at O
home O
back O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
rare O
and O
only O
with O
a O
doctor’s O
prescription O
, O
she O
added O
. O

She O
couldn’t O
have O
known O
how O
strict O
the O
laws O
were O
in O
Russia B-LOC
, O
Blagovolina B-PER
said O
. O

Boykov B-PER
also O
argued O
Griner B-PER
had O
no O
opportunity O
to O
properly O
examine O
the O
court O
documents O

He O
said O
that O
the O
Russian B-LOC
constitution O
guarantees O
everyone O
the O
right O
to O
use O
their O
native O
language O
and O
the O
free O
choice O
of O
the O
language O
of O
communication O

Boykov B-PER
cited O
an O
instance O
when O
a O
language O
interpreter O
provided O
to O
Griner B-PER
flipped O
through O
a O
lengthy O
document O
offered O
by O
an O
investigator O
for O
translation O
and O
then O
told O
Griner B-PER
, O
“ O
Basically O
, O
it O
means O
that O
you O
are O
guilty O
. O
” O

Throughout O
the O
trial O
, O
Griner’s O
attorneys O
have O
laid O
out O
arguments O
undermining O
the O
prosecution’s O
case O
and O
claiming O
her O
detention O
was O
not O
handled O
correctly O
after O
she O
was O
stopped O
February O
17 O
by O
personnel O
at O
the O
Sheremetyevo B-LOC
International I-LOC
Airport I-LOC
. O

Her O
detention O
, O
search O
and O
arrest O
were O
“improper,” O
Boykov B-PER
said O
last O
week O
, O
noting O
more O
details O
would O
be O
revealed O
during O
closing O
arguments O
. O

After O
she O
was O
stopped O
in O
the O
airport O
, O
Griner B-PER
was O
made O
to O
sign O
documents O
that O
she O
did O
not O
fully O
understand O
, O
she O
testified O
. O

At O
first O
, O
she O
said O
, O
she O
was O
using O
Google B-ORG

on O
her O
phone O
but O
was O
later O
moved O
to O
another O

where O
her O

was O
taken O
and O
she O
was O
made O
to O
sign O
more O
documents O
. O

No O
lawyer O
was O
present O
, O
Griner B-PER
testified O
, O
and O
her O
rights O
were O
not O
explained O
to O
her O
. O

Those O
rights O
would O
include O
access O
to O
an O
attorney O
once O
she O
was O
detained O
and O
the O
right O
to O
know O
what O
she O
was O
suspected O
of O

Under O
Russian B-LOC
law O
, O
she O
should O
have O
been O
informed O
of O
her O
rights O
within O
three O
hours O
of O
her O
arrest O
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
at O
the O
seventh O
hearing O
in O
her O
case O
, O
a O
defense O
expert O
testified O
that O
the O
examination O
of O
the O
substance O
contained O
in O
Griner’s B-PER
vape O
cartridges O
did O
not O
comply O
with O
Russian B-LOC
law O
. O

Blagovolina B-PER

told O

” O
in O
the O
machines O

At O
trial O
, O
Griner B-PER
testified O
she O
has O
a O
doctor’s O
prescription O
for O
medical O
cannabis O
and O
had O
no O
intention O
of O
bringing O
the O
drug O
into O
Russia B-LOC

Following O
her O
detention O
in O
February O
, O
she O
was O
tested O
for O
drugs O
and O
was O
clean O

said O

We O
continue O
to O
insist O
that O
, O
by O
indiscretion O
, O
in O

she O
packed O
her O

has O
had O
a O
terrible O
2022 O

In O
April O
, O
it O
said O
it O
lost O
subscribers O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
2011 O
. O

Its O
stock O
has O
tumbled O
more O
than O
60% O
so O
far O
this O

Yet O
its O
recent O
struggles O
may O
not O
be O
the O
start O
of O
a O
downward O
spiral O
or O
the O
beginning O

the O

for O
the O

Rather, O
it’s O
a O
sign O
that O
Netflix B-ORG
is O
becoming O
a O
more O
traditional O
media O
company. O

Netflix B-ORG
(NFLX) O
was O
originally O
valued O
as O
a O
Big O
Tech O
company O
, O
part O
of O
the O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
acronym O
, O
“FAANG,” O
which O
stood O
for O
Facebook B-ORG
(FB), O
Apple B-ORG
(AAPL), O
Amazon B-ORG
(AMZN), O
Netflix B-ORG
(NFLX) O
and O
Google B-ORG
(GOOG). O

Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
once O
valued O
the O
company O
at O
about O
$300 O
billion O
— O
a O
number O
on O
par O
with O
many O
Big B-ORG
Tech I-ORG
companies O
that O
Netflix B-ORG
(NFLX) O
’s O
business O
model O
ultimately O
couldn’t O
live O
up O
to O
. O

I O
think O
Netflix B-ORG
was O
extremely O
overvalued O
,” O
Julia B-PER
Alexander I-PER
, O
director O
of O
strategy O
at O
Parrot B-ORG
Analytics I-ORG
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
Business I-ORG
. O

Unlike O
those O
companies O
that O
have O
different O
tentacles O
, O
Netflix B-ORG
does O
not O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
tentacles O
. O

But O
Netflix B-ORG
was O
never O
really O
a O
tech O
company O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
relied O
on O
subscriber O
growth O
like O
many O
companies O
in O
the O
tech O
world O
, O
but O
its O
subscriber O
growth O
was O
built O
on O
having O
films O
and O
TV O
shows O
that O
people O
wanted O
to O
watch O
and O
pay O
for O
. O

That’s O
more O
a O
like O
a O
studio O
in O
Hollywood B-LOC
than O
a O
tech O
company O
in O
Silicon B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
. O

Netflix B-ORG
looked O
a O
lot O
more O
like O
a O
tech O
company O
than O
, O
say O
, O
Disney B-ORG
, O
Comcast B-ORG
, O
Paramount B-ORG
or O
CNN B-ORG
parent O
company O
Warner B-ORG
Bros I-ORG
. O
Discovery I-ORG
. O

But O
as O
those O
traditional O
media O
companies O
start O
to O
look O
a O
lot O
more O
like O
Netflix B-ORG
, O
Netflix B-ORG
in O
turn O
is O
starting O
to O
take O
page O
out O
of O
its O
rivals’ O
playbooks O
: O
It’s O
going O
to O
start O
serving O
ads O
and O
it O
has O
been O
releasing O
some O
shows O
over O
the O
course O
of O
weeks O
and O
months O
rather O
than O
all O
at O
once O
. O

Netflix B-ORG
has O
said O
that O
its O
cheaper O
ad O
tier O
and O
clampdown O
on O
password O
sharing O
may O
come O
next O
year O

It’s O
partnering O
with O
Microsoft B-ORG
(MSFT) O
for O
its O
ad O
business O
. O

I O
think O
in O
many O
ways O
the O
moves O
Netflix B-ORG
are O
making O
suggest O
a O
transition O
from O
tech O
company O
to O
media O
company O
,” O
Andrew B-PER
Hare I-PER
, O
a O
senior O

With O
the O
introduction O
of O
ads O
, O
crackdown O
on O
password O
sharing O
, O
marquee O
shows O
like O
‘Stranger B-ORG

experimenting O
with O
a O
staggered O

, O
we O
are O
seeing O
Netflix B-ORG
looking O
more O
like O
a O
traditional O
media O
company O
every O
day O
. O

Hare B-PER
added O
that O
Netflix’s B-ORG
former O
business O
strategy O
, O
which O
was O
“ O
once O
sacrosanct O
is O
now O
being O
thrown O
out O
the O

Netflix B-ORG
once O
forced O

deeply O
out O
of O
its O
comfort O

They O
brought O

to O
the O
American B-LOC

he O
said. O

Now O
it O
appears O
some O
more O
conventional O

could O
be O
what O

needs O

At O
Netflix B-ORG
right O
now O
, O
“ O
a O

of O
these O

” O
noted O

That O

It’s O
hard O
to O
believe O
we O
are O
face-to-face O
with O
a O
new O
health O
crisis O
, O
monkeypox O
, O
before O
we O
are O
even O
out O
of O
the O
woods O
with O
the O
previous O
– O
but O
still O
very O
much O
current O
– O
crisis O
, O
Covid-19 O
. O

The O
pandemic O
, O
which O
has O
held O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
and O
almost O
every O
other O
country O
in O
its O
grip O
, O
should O
have O
taught O
us O
valuable O
lessons O
about O
how O
to O
manage O
a O
public O
health O
emergency O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
we O
are O
making O
some O
of O
the O
same O
mistakes O
we O
made O
not O
even O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
SARS-CoV-2 O
virus O
started O
to O
spread O
. O

Testing O
for O
the O
monkeypox O
virus O
, O
once O
very O
limited O
, O
is O
now O
more O
available O
, O
but O
underused O
. O

The O
demand O
for O
vaccines O
is O
outpacing O
the O
supply O

There O
are O
nearly O
2 O
million O
courses O
the O
highly O
effective O
TPOXX O
antiviral O
sitting O
in O
the O
Strategic B-ORG
National I-ORG
Stockpile I-ORG
, O
but O
many O
health O
care O
providers O
are O
still O
having O
a O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
medication O
for O
their O
patients O
. O

We O
are O
one O
of O
the O
wealthiest O
countries O
in O
the O
world O
, O
spending O
more O
than O
$4 O
trillion O
dollars O
a O
year O
on O
health O
care O
, O
more O
per O
person O
than O
anywhere O
else O
. O

With O
all O
those O
resources O
and O
technology O
, O
it’s O
not O
as O
if O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
incapable O
of O
mounting O
a O
significant O
response O
to O
an O
emerging O
outbreak O
. O

And O
there O
is O
little O
doubt O
we O
will O
eventually O
do O
what O
should O
have O
already O
been O
done O
: O
declare O
monkeypox O
a O
public O
health O
emergency O
, O
appoint O
a O
national O
coordinator O
and O
mount O
a O
more O
significant O
response O
. O

But O
why O
do O
we O
wait O
so O
long O
, O
drag O
our O
feet O
and O
endure O
so O
much O
suffering O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

As O
I O
have O
learned O
over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
difference O
between O
preparedness O
and O
response O
, O
even O
though O
the O
two O
are O
often O
conflated O
. O

The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
extraordinarily O
prepared O
, O
ranked O
No O
. O

1 O
for O
pandemic O
preparedness O
in O
the O
2021 O
Global B-ORG
Health I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Index I-ORG
. O

Instead, O
we O
are O
leading O
in O
a O
different O
way. O

As O
of O
today O
, O
we O
have O
the O
most O
confirmed O
cases O
of O
monkeypox O
on O
the O
planet O
, O
more O
than O
5,000 O
. O

That O
is O
almost O
25% O
of O
the O
global O
numbers O
, O
even O
though O
we O
are O
just O
under O
5% O
of O
the O
world’s O
population O
. O

It O
is O
now O
clear O
: O
Preparedness O
alone O
does O
not O
guarantee O
a O
rapid O
response O
. O

With O
Covid-19 O
, O
and O
now O
monkeypox O
, O
we O
were O
too O
slow O
to O
respond O
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
we O
are O
sitting O
in O
a O
turbo-charged O
Ferrari B-ORG
, O
capable O
of O
massive O
acceleration O
, O
but O
instead O
only O
idling O
in O
the O
driveway O
. O

Cavalry O
culture O
Over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
, O
we O
have O
witnessed O
something O
counterintuitive O
. O

It O
was O
predominantly O
wealthy O
countries O
that O
were O
hit O
hardest O
during O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
. O

They O
had O
some O
of O
the O
highest O
death O
rates O
, O
despite O
their O
enormous O
resources O
. O

While O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
for O
this O
, O
including O
misinformation O
, O
lack O
of O
public O
trust O
, O
and O
the O
entangling O
of O
public O
health O
and O
politics O
, O
I O
think O
there O
is O
something O
else O
, O
as O
well O
: O
We O
have O
adopted O
what O
I O
call O
a O
“cavalry O
culture.” O

We O
wait O
for O
the O
cavalry O
to O
ride O
in O
and O
rescue O
us O
, O
instead O
of O
taking O
smaller O
preventive O
steps O
– O
such O
as O
establishing O
modern O
and O
reliable O
data O
systems O
, O
mastering O
our O
supply O
chain O
along O
the O
way O
, O
and O
acting O
early O
to O
head O
off O
the O
outbreak O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

If O
that O
sounds O
familiar O
, O
it’s O
because O
we O
too O
often O
do O
the O
same O
with O
our O
personal O
health O
matters O
. O

According O
to O
research O
published O
in O
The B-ORG
Lancet I-ORG
Public I-ORG
Health I-ORG
, O
nearly O
half O
of O
chronic O
disease O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
mostly O
preventable O
, O
with O
lifestyle O
changes O
. O

Even O
knowing O
that O
, O
however O
, O
the O
medical O
system O
is O
set O
up O
for O
the O
cavalry O
to O
come O
in O
with O
expensive O
medications O
and O
high-tech O
interventions O
, O
instead O
of O
providing O
equitable O
access O
and O
incentives O
for O
preventative O
care O
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
important O
axioms O
in O
public O
health O
. O

One O
is O
by O
the O
time O
you O
think O
you O
must O
act O
to O
contain O
an O
outbreak O
, O
it O
is O
already O
too O
late O
. O

And, O
if O
you O
think O
you O
are O
overreacting, O
you O
are O
probably O
reacting O
just O
the O
right O
amount. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Covid O
, O
and O
now O
monkeypox O
, O
we O
seem O
to O
have O
forgotten O
those O
basic O
public O
health O
principles O
. O

And, O
the O
real O
question O
now O
seems O
to O
be: O
When O
will O
the O
government O
finally O
hit O
the O
gas O
pedal O
on O
our O
highly O
tuned O
Ferrari? B-ORG

I O
don’t O
want O
to O
suggest O
any O
of O
this O
is O
easy O

There O
are O
significant O
issues O
of O
uncertainty O
and O
unpredictability O

Much O
like O
a O
hurricane O
forming O
at O
sea O
, O
we O
often O
don’t O
know O
exactly O
where O
or O
how O
hard O
it O
will O
hit O
. O

We O
want O
to O
be O
measured O
, O
calm O
in O
our O
response O
and O
to O
cause O
as O
little O
disruption O
as O
possible O
. O

We O
want O
to O
be O
thoughtful O
and O
gather O
as O
much O
information O
as O
is O
available O

And O
therein O
lies O
one O
of O
our O
biggest O
problems O
: O
basic O
data O
. O

I O
have O
often O
wondered O
, O
how O
is O
it O
that O
a O
numbers-driven O
, O
high-tech O
country O
like O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
can’t O
get O
basic O
data O
right O
. O

Data O
disaster O
As O
long O
as O
I’ve O
been O
reporting O
on O
the O
Covid O
pandemic O
, O
I O
have O
always O
had O
to O
offer O
the O
caveat O
that O
case O
numbers O
are O
probably O
off O
, O
sometimes O
wildly O
so O
. O

We O
have O
probably O
never O
had O
a O
clear O
vision O
on O
just O
how O
widely O
the O
virus O
was O
spreading O
at O
any O
given O
time O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
and O
going O
into O
the O
fall O
2022 O
, O
the O
situation O
isn’t O
really O
any O
better O
. O

In O
early O
July O
, O
the O
Institute B-ORG
for I-ORG
Health I-ORG
Metrics I-ORG
, O
a O
research O
center O
at O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Washington I-ORG
, O
released O
a O
model O
suggesting O
that O
actual O
Covid-19 O
cases O
are O
seven O
times O
higher O
than O
reported O
cases O
. O

At O
times O
, O
it O
seems O
the O
tech O
platforms O
for O
Snapchat B-ORG
and O
Twitter B-ORG
offer O
more O
data O
analytics O
than O
the O
patchwork O
of O
state O
and O
federal O
systems O
that O
underpin O
the O
public O
health O
of O
our O
country O
. O

First, O
there’s O
a O
lack O
of O
data O
access O
needed O
to O
understand O
where O
disease O
outbreaks O
are O
spreading. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
data O
collection O
limitations O
that O
Congress B-ORG
needs O
to O
fix O

I O
have O
been O
struck O
as O
we O
at O

now O
conquering O
another O

monkeypox O

as O
to O
how O
little O

we O
at O
CDC B-ORG

the O
data O
,” O
CDC B-ORG
Director O
Dr. O
Rochelle B-PER
Walensky I-PER
told O
the O
Washington B-LOC
Post I-LOC
. O

Walensky B-PER
is O
talking O
about O
basic O
data O
, O
like O
where O
the O
vaccine O
has O
gone O
, O
who O
has O
been O
vaccinated O
, O
whether O
the O
vaccine O
is O
working O
, O
and O
even O
monkeypox O
case O
data O
like O
who O
is O
getting O
infected O
, O
their O
age O
and O
race/ethnicity O
. O

Why O
might O
this O
be O
so O
? O

States O
don’t O
routinely O
share O
vaccine O
doses O
administered O
data O
with O
the O
federal O
government O
– O
Covid O
was O
really O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
successfully O
put O
data O
use O
agreements O
in O
place O
,” O
Claire B-PER
Hannan I-PER
, O
the O
executive O
director O
of O
the O
Association B-ORG
of I-ORG
Immunization I-ORG
Managers I-ORG
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

Part O
of O
the O
reason O
is O
because O
“states O
have O
laws O
in O
place O
to O
protect O
identifiable O
information.” O

Some O
information O
has O
been O
getting O
to O
the O
CDC B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
is O
challenging O
to O
get O
and O
incomplete O
. O

The O
CDC O
director O
told O
the O
Washington B-LOC
Post I-LOC
, O
“ O
We O
have O
been O
speaking O
to O
our O
state O
and O
local O
partners O
probably O
at O
least O
three O
times O
a O
week O
, O
all O
of O
them O
. O
… O

That O
is O
not O
how O
you O
synthesize O
data O

We O
need O
… O
standardization O
of O
those O
data O
, O
and O
we O
need O
to O
have O
those O
data O
come O
to O
us O
in O
a O
standardized O
fashion O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
connected O
, O
we O
can O
compile O
them O
and O
rapidly O
report O
them O
out O
. O

We O
cannot O
at O
CDC B-ORG
collect O
the O
data O
and O
make O
informed O
decisions O
by O
calling O
64 O
jurisdictions O
, O
and O
honestly O
, O
3,000 O
counties O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
is O
currently O
working O
on O
agreements O
that O
would O
broaden O
the O
agency’s O
access O
to O
states’ O
data O
, O
as O
they O
successfully O
did O
with O
Covid O
. O

Hannan B-PER
explained O
“The O
need O
to O
quickly O
get O
the O
[monkeypox] O
vaccine O
out O
left O
no O
time O
to O
get O
data O
sharing O
agreements O
in O
place O
.” O

But O
even O
if O
those O
agreements O
were O
in O
place O
, O
it O
still O
doesn’t O
mean O
the O
states’ O
ability O
to O
actually O
obtain O
vaccine O
doses O
would O
be O
made O
any O
easier O
. O

That’s O
because O
the O
states O
wouldn’t O
be O
using O
the O
same O
data O
system O
for O
ordering O
and O
tracking O
doses O
they O
generally O
use O

Because O
the O
US O
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
and I-ORG
Human I-ORG
Services I-ORG
and O
the O
Administration B-ORG
for I-ORG
Strategic I-ORG
Preparedness I-ORG
and I-ORG
Response I-ORG
are O
in O
charge O
of O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
distribution O
, O
there O
would O
be O
yet O
another O
data O
system O
involved O
. O

They O
were O
asking O
states O
to O
request O
the O
vaccine O
using O
paper O
forms O
and O
email O
said O
Hannan B-PER

They O
were O
asking O
states O
to O
complete O
forms O
[ O
with O
fillable O
fields O
] O
on O
those O
who O
were O
receiving O
the O
vaccine O
and O
return O
these O
forms O
to O
the O
federal O
government O
. O

The O
problem O
was O
there O
weren’t O
even O
the O
right O
fields O
for O
the O
specific O
questions O
being O
asked O
, O
such O
as O
reason O
for O
vaccination O
or O
type O
of O
exposure O
or O
risk O
, O
Hannan B-PER
said O
. O

It O
wasn’t O
that O
the O
necessary O
forms O
weren’t O
being O
filled O
out O
, O
it O
was O
that O
they O
couldn’t O
be O
filled O
out O
because O
of O
disparate O
data O
platforms O
. O

It O
is O
a O
baffling O
level O
of O
bureaucracy O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
unfolding O
outbreak O

Testing O
, O
vaccines O
, O
therapeutics O
As O
things O
stand O
now O
, O
the O
issues O
with O
data O
collection O
, O
testing O
, O
vaccines O
, O
treatments O
and O
communication O
are O
sounding O
a O
lot O
like O
the O
ones O
we O
experienced O
with O
Covid-19 O
. O

But, O
to O
be O
clear, O
monkeypox O
is O
not O
that O
much O
like O
Covid. O

For O
now O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
spread O
primarily O
through O
sores O
or O
lesions O
during O
close O
, O
personal O
touch O
and O
shared O
objects O
like O
towels O
and O
linens O
, O
as O
well O
as O
respiratory O
secretions O
during O
prolonged O
face-to-face O
contact O
. O

The O
monkeypox O
outbreak O
is O
also O
different O
for O
another O
fundamental O
reason O

Unlike O
with O
Covid O
, O
which O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
novel O
virus O
, O
the O
basic O
tools O
already O
exist O
either O
for O
monkeypox O
or O
its O
close O
relative O
, O
smallpox O
. O

We O
didn’t O
have O
to O
build O
them O
from O
scratch O

That O
means O
we O
could O
have O
had O
them O
or O
put O
them O
to O
better O
use O
by O
now O

Take O
testing O

At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
outbreak O
, O
testing O
capability O
was O
capped O
at O
about O
6,000 O
tests O
per O
week O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
doctors O
really O
had O
to O
ration O
them O
to O
a O
narrow O
group O
of O
people O
– O
primarily O
a O
subset O
of O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
the O
CDC B-ORG
has O
partnered O
with O
five O
labs O
to O
scale O
up O
our O
capabilities O
and O
we O
should O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
process O
up O
to O
80,000 O
tests O
a O
week O
. O

But O
the O
tests O
are O
being O
underutilized O
, O
according O
to O
CNN B-ORG
reporting O
. O

Experts O
blamed O
the O
low O
uptake O
on O
several O
factors O
, O
including O
a O
lack O
of O
awareness O
among O
doctors O
about O
the O
virus O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
stigma O
among O
patients O
. O

So, O
just O
as O
with O
Covid, O
the O
real O
scope O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
outbreak O
is O
probably O
underappreciated. O

Confirmed O
or O
probable O
cases O
stand O
around O
5,000 O
, O
according O
to O
CDC B-ORG
data O
, O
but O
the O
number O
could O
be O
several O
fold O
higher O
. O

Another O
tool O
that O
could O
be O
tremendously O
helpful O
is O
testing O
of O
wastewater O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
with O
Covid O
, O
it O
can O
better O
define O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
outbreak O
and O
where O
it O
will O
emerge O
next O
. O

Two O
months O
into O
the O
outbreak O
, O
we O
still O
aren’t O
doing O
this O
widely O
for O
monkeypox O
. O

And O
then O
there O
are O
vaccines O

Unlike O
Covid O
, O
where O
we O
spent O
upward O
of O
$20 O
billion O
to O
develop O
, O
test O
and O
distribute O
vaccines O
, O
we O
already O
have O
a O
vaccine O
specifically O
approved O
for O
monkeypox O
. O

Supplies O
were O
limited O
and O
the O
initial O
US B-LOC
vaccination O
strategy O
focused O
on O
known O
monkeypox O
cases O
and O
their O
immediate O
contacts O

But O
the O
outbreak O
continued O
to O
grow O
, O
and O
the O
strategy O
had O
to O
change O
. O

The O
count O
of O
people O
eligible O
for O
the O
two-dose O
Jynneos O
vaccine O
has O
now O
expanded O
to O
an O
estimated O
1.5 O
million O

With O
that O
same O
cavalry O
culture O
, O
we O
are O
woefully O
behind O
in O
getting O
those O
doses O
to O
people O
who O
want O
them O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
only O
336,710 O
doses O
have O
been O
shipped O
to O
states O
. O

Ordering O
only O
just O
began O
for O
about O
800,000 O
more O
doses O
. O

This O
scarcity O
has O
created O
long O
lines O
in O
monkeypox O
hotspots O
like O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
which O
has O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
cases O
in O
the O
country O
. O

It O
also O
means O
that O
the O
vaccine O
, O
which O
can O
be O
given O
within O
14 O
days O
of O
exposure O
( O
but O
preferably O
within O
four O
) O
to O
prevent O
or O
reduce O
the O
severity O
of O
disease O
, O
is O
currently O
being O
used O
more O
as O
a O
treatment O
– O
a O
post-exposure O
prophylaxis O
– O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
real O
preventive O
measure O
. O

As O
National B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Allergy I-ORG
and I-ORG
Infectious I-ORG
Diseases I-ORG
Director O
Dr. O
Anthony B-PER
Fauci I-PER
said O
on O
CNN B-ORG
, O
that O
focus O
will O
have O
to O
shift O
. O

It’s O
very O
clear O
with O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
that O
there O
now O
has O
to O
be O
a O
balance O
between O
vaccines O
available O
for O
those O
who O
clearly O
have O
been O
exposed O
, O
as O
well O
as O
those O
at O
risk O
, O
Fauci B-PER
said O
. O

What O
you O
want O
to O
do O
is O
a O
balance O
between O
vaccinating O
those O
who O
clearly O
have O
had O
an O
exposure O
but O
go O
well O
beyond O
that O

It’s O
a O
missed O
opportunity O
that O
won’t O
be O
rectified O
immediately O
, O
even O
with O
the O
soon-to-arrive O
786,000 O
doses O
announced O
by O
HHS B-ORG
this O
week O
. O

Needs O
will O
still O
outstrip O
supply O

Finally O
, O
there O
is O
the O
issue O
of O
treatment O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
has O
made O
the O
antiviral O
smallpox O
treatment O
tecovirimat O
, O
called O
TPOXX O
, O
available O
to O
monkeypox O
patients O
who O
have O
or O
are O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
severe O
disease O
under O
an O
“alternate O
regulatory O
mechanism O
.” O

There O
are O
1.7 O
million O
courses O
of O
TPOXX O
stockpiled O

But O
once O
again O
, O
getting O
the O
medication O
to O
patients O
who O
could O
immediately O
benefit O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
bureaucratically O
burdensome O
for O
both O
patients O
and O
providers O
. O

You’re O
talking O
about O
a O
five O
six-day O
time O
lag O
to O
get O
that O
medication O
to O
you O
at O
a O
local O
doctor’s O
office O
, O
no O
matter O
where O
you O
are O
. O

And O
the O
paperwork O
, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
bureaucracy O
to O
make O
that O
happen O
is O
very O
cumbersome O
, O
takes O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
your O
time O
. O

And O
that’s O
the O
barrier,” O

Stacy B-PER
Lane, I-PER
founder O
of O
the O
LGBTQ-centered O
Central B-ORG
Outreach I-ORG
Wellness I-ORG
Center I-ORG
in O
Pittsburgh, B-LOC
told O
me O
recently. O

Fortunately O
, O
those O
rules O
were O
loosened O
somewhat O
last O
week O
, O
allowing O
patients O
to O
get O
treated O
more O
quickly O
and O
reducing O
the O
amount O
of O
documentation O
needed O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
and O
the O
US B-ORG
Food I-ORG
and I-ORG
Drug I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
are O
working O
to O
further O
streamline O
the O
process O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
though O
, O
patients O
are O
suffering O
. O

Even O
though O
most O
cases O
are O
“mild,” O
they O
are O
still O
uncomfortable, O
or O
downright O
painful, O
depending O
on O
where O
sores O
appear. O

Plus, O
there O
is O
a O
risk O
of O
long-term O
complications O
if O
the O
pox O
lesions O
develop O
in O
areas O
around O
the O
eye O
or O
GI O
tract. O

All O
of O
these O
gaps O
have O
the O
hardest O
hit O
community O
on O
edge O
. O

Largely O
public O
health O
officials O
know O
how O
this O
has O
spread O

They O
know O
how O
to O
vaccinate O
people O
… O
we O
know O
how O
to O
treat O
it O
, O
and O
we O
know O
how O
to O
prevent O
it O

“ O

It O
unfortunately O
seems O
that O
despite O
two O
years O
of O
building O
up O
our O
public O
health O
infrastructure O
to O
prevent O
what O
happened O

the O

to O

flat-footed O
once O

I O

result O

you’re O
seeing O
very O
real O

Dr. O
Scott B-PER
Gottlieb I-PER
, O
a O
former O
FDA B-ORG
commissioner O
and O
current O
board O
member O
of O
Pfizer B-ORG
, O
has O
been O
pessimistic O
about O
the O
trajectory O
of O
monkeypox O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

We’re O
now O
at O
the O
cusp O
of O
this O
becoming O
an O
endemic O
virus O
, O
where O
this O
now O
becomes O
something O
that’s O
persistent O
that O
we O
need O
to O
continue O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

I O
think O
the O
window O
for O
getting O
control O
of O
this O
and O
containing O
it O
probably O
has O
closed O
and O
if O
it O
hasn’t O
closed O
, O
it’s O
certainly O
starting O
to O
close O
, O
he O
said O
on O
Face B-ORG
the I-ORG
Nation I-ORG
on O
July O
17 O
. O

CDC’s O
Walensky B-PER
pushed O
back O
on O
Gottlieb’s B-PER
assessment O
calling O
it O
“misinformed O
and O
off O
base,” O
saying O
that O
while O
it’s O
true O
there O
is O
much O
work O
to O
do, O
the O
US B-LOC
has O
made O
dramatic O
progress O
on O
priorities O
like O
testing, O
vaccines O
and O
education. O

There O
has O
been O
measurable O
progress O
in O
these O
areas O
, O
no O
doubt O
. O

But, O
I O
do O
worry O
that O
we O
once O
again O
waited O
too O
long. O

We O
sat O
idling O
in O
our O
Ferrari B-ORG
, O
perhaps O
not O
wanting O
to O
believe O
that O
somehow O
we O
had O
suddenly O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
yet O
another O
outbreak O
. O

I O
remember O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
a O
case O
of O
monkeypox O
– O
it O
was O
in O
2008 O
, O
in O
the O
Democratic B-LOC
Republic I-LOC
of O
the O
Congo I-LOC
, O
one O
of O
the O
handful O
of O
countries O
in O
Africa B-LOC
where O
the O
disease O
is O
endemic O
. O

To O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
see O
it O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
was O
a O
virus O
that O
hadn’t O
traveled O

There O
is O
no O

we O
are O

we O

The O
question O
is O
will O
we O

The O
challenge O
they O
face O
is O
exposed O
by O
a O
brief O
checkpoint O
set O
up O
in O
Croix-des-Bouquets B-LOC

where O
a O
truck O
has O
been O
dragged O
across O
a O
main O

by O
the O

torched O

Police O

One O
man O
says O
the O
situation O
is O
“bad, O
very O
bad,” O
before O
another O
gives O
him O
a O
stern O
glance. O

He O
suddenly O
changes O
tone O
: O
“ O
We O
know O
nothing O

Fear O
is O
the O
currency O
of O
this O

it O
is O

The O
journey O
is O
often O
one-way O

10,000 O

To O

that O

Johnny B-PER

at O

two O

who O
will O

of O

His O

Johnson O

already O
described O

that O
“a O

called O
him O

waffled O
on O
the O
third O

months O

but O
eventually O
decided O
to O
get O
into O
the O

because O
“ O

he O
wants O

‘ O
The O
most O
vulnerable O
Republican O

’ O
The O
Barnes B-PER
strategy O
is O
to O
define O
Johnson B-PER
as O
a O
changed O
man O
, O
someone O
who O
went O
to O
Washington B-LOC
as O
an O

enmeshed O
himself O
into O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG

by O
former O

The O
attacks O
will O
include O

own O
admission O
that O
the O
2017 O
tax O
bill O
passed O
by O
Republicans B-ORG
in O

something O
experts O
argue O
could O
effectively O
end O
the O

What O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
we O
ought O
to O
turn O
everything O
into O
discretionary O

so O
that O
it’s O
all O
evaluated O
so O
that O
we O
can O
fix O

fix O
programs O

are O
broken O
that O

going O
to O

going O

Johnson B-PER
said O
earlier O
this O
month O

Barnes B-PER
wasted O
no O
time O
jumping O
on O
the O
comment O
, O
using O
it O
to O
argue O
that O
Johnson’s B-PER
personal O

makes O
it O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
understand O
what O
these O

that’s O
on O
him O

Barnes B-PER
told O

using O
the O
Johnson B-PER
comment O
to O
inoculate O
himself O
from O
Republican O
charges O

extreme O

much O
more O
extreme O

Defined O
by O
all O
these O
left-wing O
positions’ O
The O
attacks O
on O
Barnes B-PER
center O
on O
accusations O
that O
he O
is O
too O
extreme O
for O
the O
state O
, O
using O
his O
time O
as O
a O
community O
organizer O
, O
a O
state O
assemblyman O
from O
a O
solidly O
Democratic O
district O
and O
a O
“longtime O
leader” O
in O
the O
Working B-ORG
Families I-ORG
Party I-ORG
against O
him O
as O
he O
runs O
for O
Senate O
. O

The O
hits O
include O
his O
ties O
to O
members O
of O
the O
“Squad,” O
a O
group O
of O
liberal O
lawmakers O
in O
Congress B-ORG
who O
are O
often O
attacked O
by O
Republicans; B-ORG
a O
photo O
taken O
of O
him O
holding O
up O
an O
“Abolish O
ICE” O
T-shirt; O
and O
positions O
like O
ending O
cash O
bail, O
supporting O
the O
Green O
New O
Deal O
and O
a O
host O
of O
other O
views O
the O
Johnson B-PER
campaign O
believes O
are O
too O
“extreme” O
for O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters. O

Barnes B-PER
has O
said O
he O
does O
not O
support O
abolishing O
the O
U.S. O
Immigration B-ORG
and I-ORG
Customs I-ORG
Enforcement I-ORG
but O
supports O
“addressing O
the O
concerns O
and O
issues O
and O
challenges O
that O
people O
have O
so O
that O
we O
can O
have O
a O
fair, O
comprehensive O
immigration O
reform O
system.” O

All O
of O
these O
things O
are O
positions O
that O
might O
get O
you O
applause O
at O
a O
Working B-ORG
Families I-ORG

or O
get O
you O
the O
endorsement O
of O
AOC O
or O
Bernie B-PER

but O
when O
you O
look O
across O
the O
state O
, O
that O
is O
not O
where O
50+1 O
of O
the O
state O
sits O
, O
” O
Voelkel B-PER
said O
. O

One O
issue O
that O
Barnes’ B-PER
campaign O
must O
confront O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
polls O
show O
that O
many O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
don’t O
know O
enough O
about O
him O
to O
have O
an O
opinion O
– O
something O
that O
can O
be O
both O
helpful O
and O
hurtful O
. O

Barnes O
is O
not O
nearly O
as O
known O
in O
the O
state O
as O
Johnson O

said O
Charles B-PER
Franklin I-PER
, O
pollster O

poll O
, O
citing O
a O
recent O
poll O
that O
found O
over O
50% O
of O
Democratic B-ORG
primary O
voters O
didn’t O
know O
enough O
about O
the O
lieutenant O
governor O
to O
form O
an O
opinion O
.” O

That O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
the O
Johnson B-ORG
side O
… O
to O
really O
try O
to O
step O
in O
and O
define O
Barnes O

And O
they O
plan O
to O
do O
just O
that O
, O
with O
the O
Johnson B-ORG
campaign I-ORG
and O
outside O
groups O
already O
gearing O
up O
to O
cast O
Barnes B-PER
as O
out O
of O
step O
with O
most O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
. O

He O
is O
going O
to O
be O
defined O
by O
all O
these O
left-wing O
positions O
that O
he O
took O
in O
the O
past O

Jack B-PER
Pandol I-PER

for O
Senate B-ORG
Leadership I-ORG
Fund I-ORG
, O
a O
Republican O
super O
PAC O
focused O
on O
Senate O
races O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
that O
voters O
are O
going O
to O
be O
made O
aware O
of O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
and O
that O
will O
be O
the O
first O
information O
that O
some O
voters O
are O
getting O
about O
Barnes B-PER

Barnes O
responded O
to O
these O
attacks O
by O
saying O
Republicans B-ORG
“ O
tried O
to O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
Tammy B-PER
Baldwin I-PER
,” O
and O
she O
went O
on O
to O
win O
the O
state’s O
other O
Senate O
seat O
in O
2012 O
and O
reelection O
in O
2018 O
.” O

People O
like O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER
are O
going O
to O
lie O
about O
whatever O
, O
anything O
he O
can O
think O
of O
, O
to O
take O
the O
heat O
off O
his O
own O
bad O
behavior O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
‘ O

We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool’ O
The O
question O
among O
experts O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
is O
whether O
after O
years O
of O
polarization O
and O
remarkably O
tight O
elections O
, O
there O
are O
even O
enough O
persuadable O
voters O
in O
the O
state O
to O
make O
the O
general O
election O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
base-focused O
race O
. O

Wisconsin B-LOC
has O
been O
a O
swing O
state O
for O
years O
. O

When O
Trump B-PER
won O
it O
in O
2016 O
, O
he O
was O
the O
first O
Republican O
to O
win O
it O
since O
1984 O
. O

While O
Biden B-PER
won O
the O
state O
back O
in O
2020 O
, O
the O
state O
has O
long O
had O
years O
of O
Republican O
governors O
, O
including O
Scott B-PER
Walker I-PER
from O
2011 O
to O
2019 O
, O
and O
Republicans O
control O
both O
chambers O
of O
the O
state O
legislature O
. O

We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool O
, O
said O
Joe B-PER
Zepecki I-PER
, O
a O
Democratic O
operative O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
fights O
around O
union O
rights O
in O
2011 O
and O
2012 O
led O
to O
the O
state O
being O
deeply O
polarized O
long O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
. O

So O
that O
shrinking O
segment O
of O
swing O
voters O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
ball O
game O

Yes O
, O
the O
political O
environment O
may O
be O
bad O
, O
but O
Republicans’ B-ORG
brand O
is O
rotten O
with O
those O
voters O
. O

This O
is O
why O
political O
watchers O
like O
Franklin B-PER
and O
others O
expect O
a O
deluge O
of O
negative O
ads O
in O
the O
contest O
, O
with O
both O
sides O
running O
campaigns O
that O
“ O
reflect O
that O
polarization O
that O
we O
have O
had O
for O
a O
good O
12 O
years O
.” O

Democrats B-ORG
are O
confident O
that O
if O
they O
can O
turn O
the O
race O
into O
a O
referendum O
on O
Johnson B-PER
, O
there O
are O
enough O
votes O
who O
have O
backed O
him O
in O
the O
past O
who O
are O
ready O
for O
an O
alternative O
. O

There O
is O
absolutely O
a O
world O
of O
ticket O
splitters O
, O
a O
world O
of O
persuadable O
voters O
and O
a O
world O
of O
people O
who O
might O
or O
might O
turn O
out O
, O
said O
Ben B-PER
Wikler I-PER
, O
chair O
of O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
of O
Wisconsin B-LOC

Democrats O
do O
however O
face O
a O
difficult O
national O
environment O
, O
with O
President O
Joe B-PER

poll O
numbers O
slumping O
and O

across O

skeptical O
of O
Democratic O
leadership O
in O
Washington B-LOC

With O
this O
in O
mind O
, O
Barnes B-PER
argued O
it O
would O
be O
Wisconsin B-LOC
Gov. O
Tony B-PER
Evers I-PER
– O
not O
the O
president O
– O
who O
would O
have O
the O
most O
direct O

on O
the O
contest O

Evers O
himself O
is O
up O
for O
reelection O

While O
he O
did O
not O
have O
a O
primary O
challenge O
, O
he O
will O
likely O
face O
a O
tough O
race O
against O
whoever O
emerges O
from O
what O
has O
been O
a O
tight O
Republican O
primary O
race O
on O
Tuesday O

This O
is O

And O
back O

TerraUSD B-ORG
( O

) O
, O
a O
so-called O
stablecoin O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
trade O
at O
$ O
1 O
, O
saw O
its O
price O

The O
underlying O
problem O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
risky O
lending O
, O
poor O
risk O
management O
and O
opaque O
finances O
. O

So O
when O
crypto O
prices O
crashed O
, O
likely O
as O
a O
result O
of O
fears O
of O
rising O
inflation O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
recession O
, O
some O
crypto O
companies O
didn’t O
have O
the O
capital O
to O
cushion O
the O
blow O
. O

The O
result O
has O
been O
the O
disappearance O
of O
billions O
of O
dollars O
in O
value O
, O
often O
with O
ordinary O
investors O
paying O
the O
price O
. O

Cryptocurrencies O
like O
Bitcoin B-ORG
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
independent O
of O
any O
government O

But O
we O
have O
now O
reached O
the O
point O
where O
stronger O
government O
regulation O
of O
the O
crypto O
industry O
is O
both O
necessary O
and O
inevitable O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
industry O
can’t O
just O
wait O
for O
the O
government O
to O
act O
. O

Crypto O
companies O
must O
also O
try O
to O
better O
police O
themselves O

That O
starts O
with O
providing O
more O
transparency O

While O
transparency O
is O
one O
of O
the O
core O
ideals O
of O
blockchain O
technology O
— O
all O
transactions O
on O
the O
Bitcoin B-ORG
blockchain O
are O
viewable O
for O
the O
world O
to O
see O
, O
for O
example O
— O
some O
crypto O
companies O
are O
strikingly O
opaque O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
Celsius B-ORG
, O
Vermont’s B-LOC
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
Financial I-ORG
Regulation I-ORG
has O
said O
that O
“ O

and O

to O
repay O
its O
obligations O
to O
depositors O

other O

At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
companies O
need O
to O
put O
much O
clearer O
warning O
labels O
on O
their O
products O
outlining O
the O
risks O
of O
depositing O
or O

with O
them O

as O
well O
as O
more O
information O
about O
how O

are O
being O
used O

With O
stronger O
regulation O
, O
the O
Celsius B-ORG
situation O
might O
have O
played O
out O
differently O
. O

Its O
model O
was O
essentially O
to O
take O
user O

use O
them O
for O
risky O
and O
illiquid O

and O

This O
kind O
of O
regulatory O
overhaul O
isn’t O
likely O
to O
come O
anytime O
soon O

however O

That’s O
why O
venture O

should O
push O
companies O
for O
greater O
transparency O

accountability O

sky-high O

took O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
these O
companies’ O
business O

The O

was O
true O
with O
the O

few O
publicly O
pointed O
out O

down O

Now, O
UST’s O
dramatic O
collapse O
may O
well O
hasten O
stablecoin O
regulation O
in O
the O
United B-LOC

There O
are O
widespread O
concerns O

some O
of O
the O
leading O
stablecoins O
are O
not O
nearly O
as O
stable O
as O
they O
claim O
to O
be O
. O

The O
fear O
is O
that O
if O
investors O
decided O
en O
masse O
to O
redeem O
their O
coins O
for O
the O
US B-LOC
dollars O
that O
supposedly O
back O

, O
the O
stablecoin O
issuer O
would O
not O
have O
enough O

US O

closing O

a O
bipartisan O

regulate O

consideration O

the O

has O
been O
delayed O
until O
after O
August B-LOC

The O
bill O

would O
treat O
stablecoin O

Cynthia B-PER

Hester B-PER
Peirce I-PER
, O
a O
commissioner O
at O
the O
SEC B-ORG
, O
has O
long O
argued O
for O
more O
regulatory O
clarity O
. O

If O
we O
decided O
that O
crypto O
lending O
is O
an O
area O
that O
we O
can O
implicate O
the O
securities O
laws O
, O
we O
could O
have O
sat O
down O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
and O
hammered O
out O
some O
rules O
around O
that O
that O
made O
sense O
, O
she O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
, O
speaking O
in O
her O
personal O
capacity O

Instead, O
what O
you O
often O
get O
is O
regulation O
by O
enforcement, O
where O
companies O
are O
punished O
after O
the O
fact. O

One O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
these O
one-off O
enforcement O
actions O
is O
that O
they O
don’t O
necessarily O
cover O
the O

Not O

not O

fair O

because O
sometimes O
enforcement O

‘ O
why O

you O
go O

all O

given O

it’s O
unclear O
when O

take O

an O

statement O
for O

to O
have O
to O
make O
: O
testifying O

that O

the O
testimony O
Scarlett B-PER

gave O
this O

at O
a O
hearing O
to O
determine O
damages O
against O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER

a O

earlier O

After O

six O
adults O
were O
murdered O
at O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC
Elementary I-LOC

in O
2012 O
, O
Jones B-PER
began O
to O
spin O
lurid O
conspiracies O
that O
the O
shootings O
never O
happened O
and O
that O
the O
shattered O
families O
were O
simply O
actors O
. O

The O
conspiracy O
triggered O
years O
of O
harassment O

conspiracists O
targeted O
the O
mourning O
parents O
, O
who O
have O
had O
to O
hire O

to O
protect O
themselves O
. O

Since O
the O
defamation O
suits O
were O
filed O
, O
Jones B-PER
has O
apologized O
and O
claimed O
he O
was O
in O
the O
grip O
of O
a O
“form O
of O
psychosis” O
that O
caused O
him O
to O
believe O
the O

of O

staged O

But O
within O
just O
a O
few O
years O
, O
Jones B-PER
would O
become O
part O
of O
the O
right-wing O
power O
structure O
, O
from O
his O
interviews O
with O
soon-to-be O

Donald B-PER

to O
his O
alleged O
role O
as O
an O
organizer O

More O
than O
that O
, O
many O
in O
the O

now O

And O
while O
the O
Trump B-PER
presidency O
opened O
the O
door O
for O
the O
mainstreaming O
of O
Jones B-PER
, O
it’s O
important O
to O
understand O
how O
ripe O
the O
GOP O
was O
for O
Alex B-PER
Jonesification I-PER
. O

From O
its O
beginning O
in O
the O
1940s O
and O
1950s O
, O
the O
modern O
conservative O
movement O
embraced O
a O
conspiratorial O
mindset O

From O
books O
that O
argued O

the O

But O
with O
the O
exception O
of O

the O

remained O

shied O
away O

That O
changed O
in O
the O

role O

） O

These O
threads O
came O
together O
in O
the O

as O
Beck B-PER
became O
one O
of O
the O
most O
prominent O
voices O
in O
the O
Tea B-ORG
Party I-ORG
movement O

conspiracism O
ran O
rampant O

That O
provided O
real O
opportunity O
for O
someone O
like O

to O
make O
headway O
in O
US O

While O
his O

such O
as O
the O

turned O
the O

that O
it O

a O
covert O

That O

quickly O
escaped O
InfoWars B-ORG

making O
its O
way O
to O
right-wing O
talk O

to O

Texas B-LOC
Gov. O
Greg B-PER

ordered O

Sen. O
Ted B-PER
Cruz I-PER
of O
Texas B-LOC
, O
preparing O
for O
a O
presidential O
bid O
, O
also O
legitimated O
the O
conspiracy O
, O
saying O
that O
while O
he’d O
been O
assured O
by O
the O
military O
that O
it O
was O
a O
routine O
training O
exercise O
, O
“ O
I O
understand O
the O
reason O
for O
concern O
and O
uncertainty O
, O
because O
when O
the O
federal O
government O
has O
not O
demonstrated O
itself O
to O
be O
trustworthy O
in O
this O
administration O
, O
the O
natural O
consequence O
is O
that O
many O
citizens O
don’t O
trust O
what O
it O
is O
saying O
.” O

Cruz O
’s O
pivot O
helps O
explain O
why O
the O
space O
between O
Jones B-PER
and O
the O
GOP O
collapsed O
in O
the O
2010s O

The O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
spent O
decades O
arguing O
that O
government O
was O
corrupt O
, O
if O
not O
illegitimate O
, O
and O
grew O
increasingly O
reliant O
on O
right-wing O
media O
for O
the O
party’s O
messaging O
. O

So, O
it O
took O
very O
little O
effort O
to O
tip O
over O
into O
the O
world O
of O
wild O
conspiracies O
– O
especially O
once, O
with O
the O
election O
of O
Trump, B-PER
Republicans O
realized O
there O
would O
be O
no O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
doing O
so. O

The O
last O
few O
years O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
bill O
is O
coming O
due O
– O
Trump B-PER
lost O
the O
presidency O
and O
the O
Congress O
, O
Jones B-PER
lost O
his O
defamation O
trial O
and O
several O
right-wing O
media O
outlets O
are O
facing O
hefty O
defamation O
suits O
for O
their O
election O
conspiracies O

That O
hasn’t O
yet O
curbed O
the O

Alex B-PER

Perhaps O
more O
stunning O
for O
a O
company O
with O
a O
history O
of O
substantial O
losses O
is O
that O
Uber B-ORG
said O
it O
had O
become O
cash O
flow O
positive O
, O
meaning O
it O
took O
in O
more O
money O
from O
its O
operations O

it O
spent O
, O
excluding O
capital O
expenditures O
, O
which O
typically O
includes O

The O
company O
said O
it O
generated O
$382 O
million O
in O
free O
cash O
flow O
during O
the O
quarter O

But O
Uber B-ORG
continued O
to O
be O
unprofitable O
in O
large O
part O
due O
to O
its O
investments O

Uber B-ORG
recorded O
a O
net O
loss O
of O
$2.6 O
billion O
, O
much O
of O
which O
($1.7 O

was O
related O
to O
its O
investments O
in O
other O
, O
international O
ridehail O
businesses O
like O
Didi B-ORG

Didi O

in O

, O
has O
been O
hit O
by O
a O
tremendous O
amount O
of O
regulatory O
pressure O
in O
China B-LOC

Uber B-ORG
’s O
business O
offers O
a O
unique O
window O
into O
consumer O
trends O
more O
than O
two O
years O
into O
the O

which O
initially O
decimated O
demand O
for O

and O
accelerated O
adoption O
of O

During O
the O

the O

Uber B-ORG

Uber B-ORG
CEO O
Dara B-PER
Khosrowshahi I-PER
said O
in O
a O
statement O
accompanying O
the O

Tuesday O
that O
the O
company O
“delivered O
balanced O
growth” O
and O
did O
so O
“on O
a O
platform O
that’s O
larger O
than O
ever, O
with O
the O
number O
of O
consumers O
and O
earners O
using O
Uber B-ORG
now O
both O
at O
all-time O

No O
one O
wishes O

so O
many O
of O
us O

including O
Uber B-ORG

, O
Khosrowshahi B-PER
added O
on O
a O
conference O
all O
with O
analysts O
Tuesday O
. O

But O
he O
said O
the O
economic O
environment O
has O
allowed O
Uber B-ORG
to O
show O
its O
strengths O

Shares O
of O
Uber B-ORG
jumped O
more O
than O
15% O
in O
early O
trading O
Tuesday O
following O
the O
results O

Uber’s B-ORG
results O
come O
as O
much O
of O
the O
tech O
industry O
is O
turning O
to O
hiring O
freezes O
and O
layoffs O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
weather O
a O
financial O
downturn O
marked O
by O
soaring O
inflation O
, O
rising O
interest O
rates O
, O
fears O
of O
a O
looming O
recession O
as O
well O
as O
the O
fallout O
from O
war O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC

Khosrowshahi B-PER
told O
staff O
in O
May O
that O
the O
company O
would O
cut O
costs O
and O
rethink O
its O
approach O
to O
hiring O
amid O
a O
“seismic O
shift” O
in O
the O
market O

On O
the O
call O
Tuesday O
, O
Khosrowshahi B-PER
stressed O
that O
the O
company O
can O
be O
, O
and O
has O
been O
, O
diligent O
about O
its O
expenses O
and O
still O
continue O
to O
grow O

He O
also O
noted O
that O
Uber B-ORG
benefits O
not O
only O
from O
its O
size O
but O
also O
from O
its O
range O
of O
business O
offerings O
. O

When O
we O
look O
at O
the O
competitive O
environment O
, O
this O
is O
the O
strongest O
we O
felt O
competitively O
globally O
since O
Nelson B-PER

I O
probably O
started O
here O

Khosrowshahi B-PER
said O
, O
referring O

himself O

the O

Nelson B-PER
Chai I-PER

Khosrowshahi B-PER
has O
been O
at O
the O
helm O
of O
Uber B-ORG
since O
2017 O

In O
a O
striking O
departure O
from O
the O
growth-at-all-costs O
model O
Uber B-ORG
popularized O
years O

, O
Khosrowshahi B-PER
also O
noted O
: O
“ O
You O
can’t O
spend O
your O

in O
any O

” O

Khosrowshahi B-PER
said O
Uber B-ORG
has O
been O
able O
to O
“apply O
discipline” O
as O
it O
makes O
improvements O
to O
the O
platform O
to O
serve O
drivers O
better. O

That O
includes O
better O
onboarding O

make O
it O

an O
easier O
way O

Last O

Khosrowshahi B-PER
said O
on O

that O
this O

one O

“ O

Alito B-PER

fell O
completely O

But O
what O
really O
wounded O
me O
, O
what O
really O
wounded O
me O
, O
was O
when O
the O
Duke B-PER

seemed O
to O
compare O
the O

not O
be O
spoken O

with O
the O
Russian B-LOC
attack O
on O

The O
Ukraine B-LOC
comment O
elicited O
an O
uncomfortable O
silence O

which O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
the O
audience O
was O
confused O
about O
whether O
the O
story O

merely O
a O
reflection O
of O
Alito’s B-PER

low O
opinion O

Alito’s O
comments O

hearings O

always O
decline O

deflect O
direct O
answers O

his O

confirmation O
hearing O

2006 O

Alito B-PER
deflected O
questions O
about O

with O
a O
version O
of O
an O
answer O
given O
by O
many O
other O
conservative O
nominees O

saying O
that O
the O

“ O

Public O
confidence O
in O
the O

does O
not O
require O

be O
sensible O

demonstrated O
extraordinarily O
bad O

Urban B-PER
noticed O
one O

the O

stopped O

inspect O
the O

After O
further O
examination O
, O
they O
identified O
dozens O
more O
in O
the O
area O
. O

At O
first O
, O
they O
were O
unsure O
the O
footprints O
had O
been O
made O
by O
humans O
. O

But O
after O
several O
days O
evaluating O
the O
tracks’ O
size O
shape O
and O
stride O
length O
, O
the O
researchers O
determined O
they O
were O
the O
work O

children O
. O

While O
the O
archeologists O
are O
still O
working O
to O
confirm O
the O
age O
of O
the O
footprints O
via O
radiocarbon O
dating O
, O
they O
believe O
the O
tracks O
are O
12,000 O
years O
old O
based O
on O
the O
previously O
dated O
sediment O
layer O
beneath O
them O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
prints O
were O
exposed O
to O
the O
surface O
around O
the O
same O
time O
as O
artifacts O
found O
to O
be O
12,300 O

old O
, O
Duke B-PER
said O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
freshwater O
wetlands O
needed O
to O
preserve O
the O

have O
not O
existed O
in O
the O

for O
at O

10,000 O

In O

would O
mean O
that O

A O

After O

On O

The O

who O

alluded O
to O

during O
the O
January O

2021 O
, O

at O

“ O
Having O
the O

was O
politicized O
, O
that O
puts O
the O

Friday O
.” O

We O
want O
to O
continue O

so O
that O
they O

In O
a O

However O

As O

not O
to O

the O

, O
“ O
I O
Just O

” O
has O
to O
rank O
pretty O
high O
on O
the O
list O

Yet O
there O
are O
enough O
twists O
in O
Netflix’s B-ORG
latest O
true-crime O
docuseries O
to O
keep O
audiences O
engaged O

with O
another O
sensational O
case O
that’s O
more O
of O
a O
whydunit O
– O
given O
the O
killer’s O
immediate O
confession O
– O
than O
who O
. O

The O
phrase O
in O
the O
title O
was O
uttered O
in O
2019 O
by O
then-17-year-old O
Anthony B-PER
Templet I-PER
, O
who O
had O
just O
shot O
his O
father O
in O
their O
home O
in O
Baton B-LOC
Rouge I-LOC
, O
Louisiana B-LOC
. O

Over O
three O
episodes O
, O
director O
Skye B-PER
Borgman I-PER
( O
also O
responsible O
for O
Netflix’s B-ORG
“Girl O
In O

teases O
out O
the O
events O
that O
preceded O
those O
actions O
, O
including O
allegations O
of O
abuse O

child O
abduction O

as O
well O
as O
the O

by O

Burt B-PER
, O
to O
home O
school O
him O
and O
demand O
that O
he O
know O
the O
boy’s O
whereabouts O
at O
all O
times O
. O

I O
Just O
Killed O
My O
Dad O
” O
thus O
gradually O
peels O
back O
layers O
on O
this O
sordid O
saga O
– O
“ O
sordid O
being O
the O
operative O
word O
for O
almost O
everything O
that O
Netflix B-ORG
does O
in O
the O
true-crime O
space O
, O
including O
its O
recent O
entries O
“ O
The O
Most O
Hated O
Man O
on O
the O
Internet O
” O
and O
“ O
Our O
Father O
.” O

What O
makes O
it O
all O
vaguely O
chilling O
is O
Anthony’s B-PER
numb O
, O
unemotional O
response O
– O
seemingly O
convinced O
he O
hasn’t O
done O
anything O
wrong O
– O
and O
his O
overall O
manner O
, O
which O
indicates O
that O
not O
all O
has O
been O
right O
within O
the O
home O
. O

After O
the O
initial O
flurry O
of O
twists O
, O
the O
tale O
does O
bog O
down O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
giving O
way O
to O
Anthony’s B-PER
lawyer O
and O
the O
prosecutor O
in O
the O
case O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
path O
that O
feels O
like O
justice O
given O
all O
the O
extenuating O
circumstances O
. O

As O
the O
latter O
notes O
, O
there O
’s O
understandable O
concern O
about O
appearing O
to O
sanction O
murder O
, O
and O
how O
letting O
the O
boy O
go O
might O
be O
perceived O
. O

The O
case O
was O
resolved O
in O
2021 O
, O
but O
not O
knowing O
how O
adds O
to O
the O
viewing O
experience O
. O

Frankly O
, O
“ O
I O
Just O
Killed O
My O
Dad O
” O
seems O
to O
exist O
largely O
because O
of O
that O
attention-getting O
title O
, O
which O
weds O
old-fashioned O
exploitation O
movies O
with O
the O
fare O
normally O
found O
on O
channels O
like O
Investigation B-ORG
Discovery I-ORG
. O

Netflix B-ORG
has O
gone O
a O
bit O
overboard O
with O
these O
kind O
of O
docuseries O
in O
terms O
of O
sheer O
volume O
, O
but O
to O
be O
fair O
, O
so O
has O
everyone O
else O
. O

Moreover O
, O
these O
projects O
reliably O
light O
up O
social O
media O
for O
a O
lot O
less O
money O
than O
going O
out O
and O
hiring O
an O
all-star O
cast O
. O

While O
something O
like O
“ O
I O
Just O
Killed O
My O
Dad O
” O
might O
not O
be O
the O
kind O
of O
material O
that’s O
fun O
for O
the O
whole O
family O
, O
it’s O
the O
sort O
of O

the O

were O
out O

The O
miners O
who O
were O
still O
employed O
were O
prescribed O
opiates O

After O
decades O
of O
disinvestment O
in O
the O

parts O

Kentucky B-LOC
are O
experiencing O
an O

County I-LOC
, O
two O
of O
the O
areas O
hit O
hardest O
by O
the O

saw O
their O
populations O
decline O
by O
about O
12% O
each O
between O
2010 O

2020 O
, O
according O
to O
data O
from O
the O
US B-ORG

Poverty O
rates O
in O
counties O

are O
more O
than O
twice O
the O
national O
average O

and O
unemployment O
rates O
are O
similarly O
grim O

Those O
conditions O
translate O
to O
a O
shrinking O

providing O
local O

little O

The O
beautiful O

a O
point O
of O
pride O
for O
the O

also O
presents O
challenges O

Eastern B-LOC
Kentucky I-LOC
is O
made O
up O
of O
hills O
and O
“hollers,” O
or O
narrow O
valleys O
cut O
by O
streams. O

But O
the O
steep O
slopes O
are O
prone O
to O
landslides O
, O
leaving O
the O
valleys O
vulnerable O
to O
flash O
flooding O
. O

Building O
in O
the O
hills O
could O
mitigate O
flood O
risks O
, O
but O
doing O
so O
is O
extremely O
costly O
, O
says O
Bill B-PER
Haneberg I-PER
. O

People O
have O
really O
very O
little O
choice O
except O
to O
live O
in O

When O
historic O
levels O
of O
rain O
began O
to O
fall O
in O
late O
July B-LOC
, O
the O
creeks O
along O
the O

turned O
into O
raging O
rivers O
, O
knocking O
already O
fragile O
homes O
off O
their O
foundations O
. O

The O
floodwaters O
washed O
away O
dirt O
roads O

small O

some O
lost O
their O

As O
a O
warming O
planet O
threatens O
to O
make O
extreme O
weather O
events O
like O
this O
more O
common O
, O
there O
are O
concerns O
about O
how O
decades O
of O
coal O
mining O
and O
fossil O
fuel O
extraction O
have O
altered O
the O
region’s O
landscape O
. O

It’s O
likely O
we O
would O
have O
had O
extremely O
severe O
flooding O
even O
if O
there O
had O
never O
been O
a O
coal O
mine O
in O
eastern B-LOC
Kentucky I-LOC
, O
Haneberg B-PER
says O
. O

The O
question O
that O
we O
don’t O
know O
the O
answer O
to O
is O
: O
How O
much O
might O
this O
amount O
of O
disturbance O
have O
increased O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
current O
floods O
? O

One O
county O
formed O
an O

These O
circumstances O
are O
part O
of O
why O
Slone B-PER

so O
compelled O

be O
there O
for O
her O

After O
a O
few O
days O
of O
cooking O
and O
delivering O
meals O
with O
the O

of O
her O
mother O

, O
she O
realized O
there O
were O
people O
in O
the O
community O
who O
weren’t O
being O
reached O
. O

So O
she O
enlisted O
some O
friends O
with O
off-road O
vehicles O
to O
go O
into O
the O
hollers O
where O
their O
truck O
can’t O

They O
travel O
deep O
into O
these O
remote O
communities O
to O
deliver O
meals O
and O
cleaning O
supplies O
, O
asking O
the O
residents O
they O
encounter O
how O
many O
more O
houses O
are O
past O
them O
. O

If O
they O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
vehicle O
to O
climb O
their O
way O
there O
, O
they O
do O
. O
“ O

A O

out O

not O
alone O

people O
out O

out O

they O
can O

Shelton B-PER

Truly O
everyone O
is O
doing O
mutual O

whether O
they’re O
calling O
it O
that O

Locals O
feel O
they’ve O
long O
been O
overlooked O

caring O
for O
one’s O

isn’t O
just O
a O
benevolent O
gesture O
– O
it’s O
survival O
. O

One O
thing O
that O
we O
realized O
over O
the O
course O
of O
mutual O
aid O
is O
most O
people O
around O
here O
are O
of O
the O
mindset O
that O
the O
government O

these O
institutions O
that O
we’re O
supposed O
to O
rely O

really O
don’t O
care O
if O
poor O
people O
live O

die O

And O
I O
believe O
that O

That O
feeling O

runs O
deep O

that O
the O

such O

for O

In O

a O

Ministry I-ORG
described O
the O

exercises O
as O
“irrational” O

Chinese B-LOC
Customs O
claimed O
the O

the O
suspension O

Democrats O
’ O
push O
to O
advance O
their O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
bill O
is O
likely O
headed O
for O
a O
procedural O
speed O
bump O
known O
in O
Washington B-LOC
as O
a O
“vote-a-rama O
.” O

The O
time-consuming O
and O
stamina-challenging O
process O
is O
among O
the O
final O
obstacles O
for O
Democrats B-ORG
, O
along O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian’s O
review O
of O
the O
package O
. O

Politically O
, O
a O
vote-a-rama O
gives O
Republicans B-ORG
a O
chance O
to O
sow O
discord O
and O
create O
distractions O
as O
they O
force O
Democrats B-ORG
to O
vote O
on O
controversial O
issues O
. O

But, O
once O
it’s O
over, O
Democrats B-ORG
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
advance O
their O
package O
on O
a O
straight O
party-line O
vote O
that O
would O
not O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
filibuster’s O
60-vote O
threshold. O

Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
: O
What O
is O
a O
vote-a-rama O
? O

Usually O
in O
the O
legislative O
process O
, O
lawmakers O
can O
use O
a O
series O
of O
procedural O
maneuvers O
to O
avoid O
voting O
on O
amendments O
. O

But O
in O
a O
budget O
reconciliation O
process O
– O
which O
Democrats B-ORG
are O
using O
to O
advance O
their O
bill O
– O
you O
can’t O
do O
that O
. O

Lawmakers O
cannot O
hold O
a O
final O
vote O
on O
a O
reconciliation O
bill O
until O
all O
the O
amendments O
have O
been O
“disposed O
of,” O
or O
in O
simpler O
terms, O
“voted O
on.” O

The O
practice O
involves O
votes O
on O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
that O
can O
– O
and O
usually O
do O
– O
stretch O
for O
hours O

How O
do O
lawmakers O
use O
the O
process O
? O

The O
party O
in O
charge O
typically O
wants O
to O
move O
this O
vote-a-rama O
along O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
with O
as O
few O
votes O
as O
possible O

The O
minority O
party O
takes O
the O
opportunity O
to O
force O
votes O
on O
all O
kinds O
of O
measures O
they O
don’t O
typically O
have O
the O
power O
to O
put O
on O
the O
floor O

How O
long O
does O
each O
vote O
take O
? O

Usually O
, O
lawmakers O
agree O
to O
a O
process O
that O
looks O
a O
lot O
like O
this O
. O

Each O
amendment O
takes O
about O
15 O
minutes O
or O
so O
to O
get O
through O

The O
process O
moves O
quickly O
by O
Senate B-ORG
standards O
, O
which O
is O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
for O
members O
to O
basically O
stay O
in O
or O
close O
by O
the O
chamber O
for O
the O
entire O
marathon O
event O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill O
? O

The O
bill O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ O
goals O
, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years O
: O
Still O
, O
this O
isn’t O
Build O
Back O
Better O
2.0 O
. O

The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
key O
Democratic O
priorities O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
left O
out O
. O

said O

speaking O

It’s O
a O
pain O
that O
may O
affect O
them O
for O
years O
to O
come O
, O
she O
said O
. O

At O
first O
, O
she O
thought O
the O
shots O
she O
heard O
were O
seniors O
popping O
balloons O
That O
afternoon O
, O
Welch B-PER
recalls O
, O
she O
was O
in O
a O
history O
class O
in O
Building O
C O
, O
preparing O
for O
a O
quiz O

chatting O
about O

With O

There O

no O

everyone O
going O
about O

day O

Welch B-PER

Seniors O
talking O

in O
the O

about O
what O
they O
will O
do O
after O

up O

Shortly O
afterward O
, O
several O
loud O
pops O
punctuated O
the O
students’ O
chatter O
. O

Welch O
and O
her O
classmates O
initially O
dismissed O
the O
sounds O
, O
she O
said O
, O
thinking O
that O
giddy O

were O
popping O

But O
the O
bangs O
got O
louder O
, O
Welch B-PER
said O
, O
and O
students O
in O
the O
hallway O
started O
screaming O
. O

Moments O
later O
, O
the O
gunman O
appeared O
in O
the O
doorway O
of O
her O
class O
, O
raised O
his O
gun O

started O
firing O

Her O

Beamon B-PER
Hill I-PER

pushed O
her O
out O

way O

Everything O
was O
happening O
so O
fast O

All O
I O
remember O
is O
Beamon B-PER
instantly O
shoved O
me O
to O
the O
ground O

taking O
the O
bullet O

Welch O
fell O
to O
the O

saw O
Beamon B-PER
sprawled O
nearby O
, O
bleeding O
from O
his O
head O
, O
she O
said O

She O
began O
weeping O
as O
she O
struggled O
to O
understand O
what O
was O
going O
on O

Classmates O
yanked O
me O
behind O
a O
cabinet O
to O
hide O

covered O
my O
mouth O
to O
stay O
quiet O

Welch B-PER

Before O

reached O
Welch’s B-PER
class O
, O
Houston B-LOC
had O

into O
Brens’ B-PER

shot O

Beamon B-PER
, O
according O

Houston B-LOC

out O
his O

impassively O

later O
told O
a O

He O
looked O

One O

turned O
off O

Vanartsdalen B-PER

Now O
every O
time O
I O
hear O
of O
another O

shooting O
, O
my O
heart O
breaks O

I O
know O
the O

the O
hurt O

the O
struggle O
they O
will O
go O

A O

the O

the O

chirping O
outside O

She O
remembers O
peeking O
outside O

seeing O
the O
shooter O
pace O
up O

down O
the O

He O
fired O
again O

again O

unleashing O
a O

There O

all O
this O
popping O

Vanartsdalen B-PER

I O
can O
still O
smell O
the O
gunpowder O
to O
this O
day O

Vanartsdalen B-PER
removed O

closed O

locked O

She O
ordered O
the O
students O
onto O

She O
crawled O
across O

pulled O
a O

down O

punched O
911 O
over O

No O

And O
then O
she O

going O
a O
million O
miles O
an O
hour O

she O
said O

Some O
survivors O
fled O
the O
school O

took O
refuge O
in O
a O

Houston B-LOC

herded O

into O
an O
upstairs O

As O

After O

quieted O
down O

someone O
opened O
an O

they O
all O
fled O

We O
all O
ran O
like O

the O

banging O
on O

doors O
to O
let O
us O

Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
she O
led O
Welch O

a O

to O
a O
nearby O

In O
her O
eagerness O
to O
let O

the O

grabbed O
the O
screen O

with O
such O
force O
that O
she O
yanked O
it O
off O
its O

The O
terrified O

reluctant O
at O

Vanartsdalen B-PER
remained O
at O
the O

until O
the O

gone O
home O
safely O

Not O
until O
she O
emerged O
three O
hours O
later O
and O
walked O
back O
to O
the O
school O
did O
she O
begin O
to O
comprehend O
the O
magnitude O
of O
what O
was O
happening O

At O
the O
time O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
the O
only O
survivors O
, O
” O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
. O

Houston B-LOC
was O
still O
holding O
about O
80 O
students O
hostage O
in O
a O
classroom O
, O
and O
no O
one O
knew O
what O

a O

He O

about O
10:30 O

Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
she O
was O
still O
outside O
the O
school O
when O
authorities O
led O
him O
out O
in O

That’s O
when O

a O

shooting’s O
effects O

For O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
and I-PER
Welch I-PER

the O
impact O
of O
the O
tragedy O
lingers O
30 O
years O
later O

Welch O
now O

works O
at O

hospital’s O

Vanartsdalen B-PER

retired O

lives O
in O
Marysville B-LOC

California B-LOC

about O
five O
miles O

Both O
women O
said O
surviving O
a O
school O
shooting O
heightens O
your O
alertness O
in O
a O
way O
nothing O
else O
does O

Even O
now O
, O
every O
time O
they O
visit O
a O
store O
, O
restaurant O
, O
or O
other O
public O
place O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
they O
do O
is O
map O
out O
an O
exit O
strategy O
. O

Vanartsdalen B-PER
is O
wary O
of O
hovering O
helicopters O
, O
firecrackers O
and O
popping O
balloons O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
dinner O
date O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
she O
almost O
panicked O
when O
she O
noticed O
a O
man O
pacing O
anxiously O
in O
the O
restaurant O
. O

The O
moment O
passed O
without O
incident O
, O
but O
she O
remains O
vigilant O
about O
her O
safety O
. O

Both O
women O
said O
they O
got O
weeks O
of O
counseling O
and O
therapy O
afterward O

But O
back O
then O
, O
therapists O
were O
not O
as O
equipped O
to O
handle O
mass O
shootings O
. O

My O
therapist O
seemed O
so O
overwhelmed O
with O
everything O
, O
I O
stopped O
going O
after O
a O
while O
, O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O

What O
seemed O
to O
help O
more O
was O
talking O
about O
it O
with O
other O
people O
in O
the O
community O
, O
both O
friends O
and O
strangers O
. O

Several O
months O
after O
the O
shooting O
, O
Welch B-PER
was O
surprised O
to O
receive O
a O
package O
with O
an O
autographed O
photo O
and O
a O
note O
from O
Mariah B-PER
Carey I-PER
, O
one O
of O
her O
favorite O
singers O
. O

I’m O
so O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
friend O
and O
the O
horrible O
situation O
you O
went O
through O
,” O
it O
said O
. O

It’s O
great O
that O
you O
have O
such O
a O
positive O
attitude O
about O
things O
now O
. O

And O
in O
1994 O
, O
Welch B-PER
was O
a O
guest O
on O
Oprah B-PER
Winfrey’s I-PER
TV O
show O
, O
where O
she O
appeared O
with O
other O
survivors O
of O
mass O
shootings O
and O
shared O
her O
recollections O
of O
that O
fateful O
day O
. O

Oprah B-PER
asked O
me O
questions O
about O
my O
experience O
and O
how O
I O
was O
handling O
things O
now O

We O
did O
talk O
a O
little O
about O
Beamon O
,” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

What O
I O
remember O
most O
is O
her O
kindness O
… O
her O
words O
of O
encouragement O
to O
stay O
strong O
and O
do O
positive O
things O
in O
life O
. O

These O
days O
, O
as O
school O
shootings O
become O
more O
common O
, O
Welch B-PER
said O
she’s O
forced O
to O
replay O
that O
day O
over O
and O
over O
. O

Every O
new O
shooting O
is O
a O
trigger O
– O
and O
a O
reminder O
of O
what O
lies O
ahead O
for O
the O
survivors O

“ O
Those O
poor O
kids O
from O
all O
these O
school O
shootings O
will O
have O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
live O
their O
lives O
going O
forward O
,” O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O

The O
women O
still O
remember O
those O
who O
died O
that O
day O

Welch O
said O
she O
will O
never O
forget O
her O
classmate O
Beamon’s O
heroic O
act O

She’s O
told O
her O
two O
children O
about O
the O
popular O
16-year-old O
prankster O
who O
helped O
keep O
everyone O
loose O
and O
may O
have O
saved O
their O
mother’s O
life O

Welch O
said O
she O
remembers O
that O
earlier O
that O
day O
, O
Beamon B-PER
had O
tossed O
a O
crumpled-up O
piece O
of O
paper O
across O
the O
classroom O
. O

When O
the O
teacher O
asked O
who O
did O
it O
, O
he O
had O
put O
on O
his O
game O
face O
and O
pointed O
at O
Welch B-PER

The O
other O
classmates O
erupted O
into O
laughter O
because O
they O
knew O
he O
was O
the O
culprit O
, O
she O
said O
. O

Beamon B-PER
got O
me O
in O
so O
much O
trouble O
,” O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O

He O
knew O
exactly O
how O
to O
make O
me O
smile O
when O
I O
was O
stressed O
before O
a O
test O
. O

Houston B-LOC
was O
eventually O
convicted O
of O
four O
counts O
of O
first-degree O
murder O
and O
remains O
on O
death O
row O
at O
San B-LOC
Quentin I-LOC
State I-LOC
Prison I-LOC

The O
Olivehurst B-LOC
community O
has O
largely O
moved O
on O
from O
the O
shooting O
, O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
, O
and O
people O
there O
rarely O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
except O
on O
the O
anniversary O
. O

But O
revisiting O
what O
happened O
on O
May O
1 O
, O
1992 O
, O
remains O
a O
form O
of O
therapy O
for O
her O
– O
and O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
those O
who O
were O
lost O
. O

Four O
people O
died O
that O
day O

she O
said O

Wisconsin B-LOC
Republican O
Sen. O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER

Democratic O
Lt. O

Gov. O
Mandela B-PER
Barnes I-PER
are O
political O
opposites. O

But O
as O
the O
two O
prepare O
for O
what O
could O
become O
one O
of O
the O
most O
closely O
watched O
Senate B-ORG
races O
of O
the O
2022 O
cycle O
, O
they O
are O
leveling O
similar O
attacks O
to O
define O
each O
other O

Casting O
their O
opponent O
as O
too O
extreme O

out O
of O

with O
Wisconsin B-LOC

while O
arguing O
the O

The O
problem O
is O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER

turned O
his O
back O
on O

Barnes B-PER

when O
asked O
for O
the O
single O
biggest O
difference O
between O
himself O
and O
Johnson B-PER

who O
made O
millions O
running O
a O
plastics O
manufacturer O
before O
he O
entered O
public O
office O

His O
wealth O
isn’t O
the O
problem O
– O
it’s O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
ultra-wealthy O
and O
out O
of O

Johnson’s O
campaign O
declined O
to O
make O
him O
available O
to O
CNN B-ORG
, O
but O
a O
Johnson B-PER
campaign O
adviser O
previewed O
a O
notably O
similar O
message O
. O

(Barnes) O
is O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
where O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
state O
is O
,” O
said O
adviser O
Ben B-PER
Voelkel I-PER
, O
citing O
some O
of O
the O
more O
liberal O
positions O
Barnes O
has O
backed O
throughout O
his O
career O
. O

Mandela B-PER
Barnes I-PER
talks O
a O
lot O
about O
his O
dad O
working O
the O
third O

Mandela B-PER
Barnes I-PER
hasn’t O
done O
any O
of O
that O

He O
has O
been O
a O
career O
political O
activist O
. O

Johnson O
has O
already O
described O
Barnes B-PER
as O
Democrats’ O
“most O
radical O
left O
candidate,” O
adding O
that O
“a O
radical O
left O
Senator O
from O
Wisconsin B-LOC
is O
not O
the O
solution.” O

Johnson B-PER
recently O
called O
him O
“a O
progressive O
puppet O
out O
to O
fundamentally O
change O
America B-LOC
.” O

The O
attacks O
– O
delivered O
ahead O
of O
Tuesday’s O
Wisconsin B-LOC
Senate O
primaries O
, O
which O
appear O
to O
be O
already O
decided O
– O
are O
previews O
of O
what O
will O
likely O
become O
an O
acrimonious O
race O
, O
one O
that O
experts O
expect O
will O
see O
tens O
of O
millions O
spent O
on O
negative O
advertising O
as O
each O
side O
attempts O
to O
solidify O
their O
base O
voters O
in O
November O
. O

Johnson O
, O
the O
incumbent O
, O
faces O
no O
primary O
challenge O
after O
he O
opted O
to O
run O
for O
a O
third O
term O
. O

The O
senator O
, O
who O
promised O
to O
only O
serve O
another O
full O
term O
when O
he O
ran O
for O
reelection O
in O
2016 O
, O
waffled O
on O
the O
third O
term O
for O
months O
, O
but O
eventually O
decided O
to O
get O
into O
the O
race O
because O
“ O
America B-LOC
is O
in O
peril O
” O
and O
he O
wants O
to O
end O
Democratic B-ORG
control O
of O
Washington B-LOC
. O

Barnes O
initially O
had O
significant O
primary O
challengers O
, O
including O
Milwaukee B-ORG
Bucks I-ORG
executive O
Alex B-PER
Lasry I-PER
, O
who O
spent O
more O
than O
$11 O
million O
of O
his O
own O
money O
airing O
ads O
throughout O
the O
state O
. O

But O
over O
the O
span O
of O
a O
week O
last O
month O
, O
Barnes’ B-PER
three O
top O
primary O
opponents O
– O
Lasry B-PER

Wisconsin B-LOC
state O
Treasurer O
Sarah B-PER
Godlewski I-PER
and O
Outagamie B-LOC
County I-LOC
Executive O
Tom B-PER
Nelson I-PER
– O
all O
dropped O
out O
of O
the O
race O
and O
endorsed O
the O
lieutenant O
governor O
, O
effectively O
ending O
the O
primary O
. O

I O
could O
not O
have O
imagined O
it O
ending O
up O
this O
way,” O
Barnes B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O

To O
me O
, O
it O
shows O
just O
how O
important O
beating O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER

, O
just O
how O
important O
expanding O
the O
democratic O
majority O

. O

As O
the O
two O
candidates O
turn O
their O
focus O
on O
each O
other O
, O
Wisconsin B-LOC
represents O
yet O
another O
example O
of O
a O
high O
stakes O
Senate O
race O
where O
the O
contrast O
between O
candidates O
is O
significant O
, O
including O
Republican O
Herschel B-PER
Walker I-PER

Democratic O
Sen. O
Raphael B-PER
Warnock I-PER

Blake B-PER
Masters I-PER
vs. O
Democratic O
Sen. O
Mark B-PER
Kelly I-PER
in O
Arizona B-LOC

‘The O
most O
vulnerable O
Republican O
incumbent’ O
The O
Barnes B-PER
strategy O
is O
to O
define O
Johnson B-PER
as O
a O
changed O
man, O
someone O
who O
went O
to O
Washington B-LOC
as O
an O
insurgent O
candidate O
but O
then O
enmeshed O
himself O
into O
the O
Republican O
Party B-ORG
led O
by O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump. I-PER

The O
attacks O
will O
include O
Johnson’s B-PER
own O
admission O
that O
the O
2017 O
tax O
bill O
passed O
by O
Republicans B-ORG
in O
Washington B-LOC
benefited O
his O
own O
company O
; O
his O
reported O
role O
in O
attempting O
to O
push O
a O
slate O
of O
fake O
electors O
after O
the O
2020 O
election O
; O
and O
his O
more O
recent O
suggestion O
that O
Social B-ORG
Security I-ORG
and O
Medicare B-ORG
, O
two O
popular O
social O
spending O
programs O
, O
be O
changed O
from O
mandatory O
to O
discretionary O
spending O
, O
something O
experts O
argue O
could O
effectively O
end O
the O
programs O
. O

What O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
we O
ought O
to O
turn O
everything O
into O
discretionary O
spending O
so O
that O
it’s O
all O
evaluated O
so O
that O
we O
can O
fix O
problems O
or O
fix O
programs O
that O
are O
broken O
that O
are O
going O
to O
be O
going O
bankrupt O
, O
Johnson B-PER
said O
earlier O
this O
month O
. O

Barnes B-PER
wasted O
no O
time O
jumping O
on O
the O
comment O
, O
using O
it O
to O
argue O
that O
Johnson’s B-PER
personal O
wealth O
makes O
it O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
understand O
what O
these O
programs O
mean O
to O
working O
class O
people O
. O

If O
he O
wants O
be O
anti-Social O
Security O
, O
that’s O
on O
him O
, O
Barnes B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
using O
the O
Johnson B-PER
comment O
to O
inoculate O
himself O
from O
Republican O
charges O
of O
being O
too O
extreme O
. O

That’s O
much O
more O
extreme O
than O
wanting O
working O
families O
and O
people O
all O
across O
Wisconsin B-LOC
have O
a O
fair O
shot O
. O

With O
the O
primary O
all O

decided O
, O
Barnes B-PER
put O
out O
an O
attack O
ad O
earlier O
this O
month O
that O
hit O
Johnson B-PER
on O
outsourcing O

more O
out O

the O
ad O
says O

Democrats O
are O
also O
preparing O
to O
paint O
Johnson B-PER
as O
a O
candidate O
who O
has O
become O
a O
conspiracy O
theory O
promoter O
, O
including O
questioning O
the O
push O
to O
vaccinate O
people O
against O
the O

, O
calling O
climate O

“bullsh*t,” O
and O
suggesting O

without O

that O

Republican O
operatives O
working O
on O
Senate B-ORG
campaigns O
acknowledged O
the O
impact O
some O
of O
Johnson’s B-PER
comments O
have O
had O
on O
his O
image O

A O
recent O
Marquette B-ORG
Law I-ORG
School I-ORG
poll O
found O
that O
46% O

unfavorably O

37% O

But O
one O
operative O
argued O
that O
some O
positive O
Johnson B-PER
messaging O
over O
the O
summer O

significant O

an O
outside O

His O

adding O
that, O
no O

what, O
“it O

negative O

central O
to O
their O
plan O

The O
attacks O
on O
Barnes B-PER
center O
on O
accusations O
that O
he O
is O
too O
extreme O
for O

against O
him O

The O
hits O

his O

the O
“Squad,” O
a O
group O

liberal O

positions O

a O
host O
of O

views O
the O
Johnson B-PER

believes O
are O
too O
“extreme” O
for O

does O
not O
support O
abolishing O
the O
U.S. O

supports O

” O
Voelkel B-PER

One O
issue O
that O
Barnes’ B-PER
campaign O
must O
confront O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
polls O
show O
that O
many O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
don’t O
know O
enough O
about O
him O
to O
have O
an O
opinion O
– O
something O
that O
can O
be O
both O
helpful O
and O
hurtful O
. O

Barnes O
is O
not O
nearly O
as O
known O
in O
the O

Johnson O

said O
Charles B-PER
Franklin I-PER
, O
pollster O
for O

Marquette B-ORG
Law I-ORG

poll O
, O
citing O
a O
recent O
poll O
that O
found O
over O
50% O
of O
Democratic B-ORG
primary O
voters O
didn’t O
know O
enough O
about O
the O
lieutenant O
governor O
to O
form O
an O
opinion O
.” O

That O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
the O
Johnson B-ORG
side O
… O
to O
really O
try O
to O
step O
in O
and O
define O
Barnes B-PER

And O
they O
plan O
to O
do O
just O
that O
, O
with O
the O
Johnson B-ORG
campaign I-ORG
and O
outside O
groups O
already O
gearing O
up O
to O
cast O
Barnes B-PER
as O
out O
of O
step O
with O
most O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
. O

He O
is O
going O
to O
be O
defined O
by O
all O
these O
left-wing O
positions O
that O
he O
took O
in O
the O
past O
, O

Jack B-PER
Pandol I-PER

spokesman O
for O
Senate B-ORG
Leadership I-ORG
Fund I-ORG
, O
a O
Republican O
super O
PAC O
focused O
on O
Senate O
races O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
that O
voters O
are O
going O
to O
be O
made O
aware O
of O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
and O
that O
will O
be O
the O
first O
information O
that O
some O
voters O
are O
getting O
about O
Barnes B-PER

Barnes O
responded O
to O
these O
attacks O
by O
saying O
Republicans O
“ O
tried O
to O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
Tammy B-PER
Baldwin I-PER
,” O
and O
she O
went O
on O
to O
win O
the O
state’s O
other O
Senate O
seat O
in O
2012 O
and O
reelection O
in O
2018 O
.” O

People O
like O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER
are O
going O
to O
lie O
about O
whatever O
, O
anything O
he O
can O
think O
of O
, O
to O
take O
the O
heat O
off O
his O
own O
bad O
behavior O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
‘ O

We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool’ O
The O
question O
among O
experts O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
is O
whether O
after O
years O
of O
polarization O
and O
remarkably O
tight O
elections O
, O
there O
are O
even O
enough O
persuadable O
voters O
in O
the O
state O
to O
make O
the O
general O
election O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
base-focused O
race O
. O

Wisconsin B-LOC
has O
been O
a O
swing O
state O
for O
years O

When O
Trump B-PER
won O
it O
in O
2016 O
, O
he O
was O
the O
first O
Republican O
to O
win O
it O
since O
1984 O
. O

While O
Biden B-PER
won O
the O
state O
back O
in O
2020 O
, O
the O
state O
has O
long O
had O
years O
of O
Republican O
governors O
, O
including O
Scott B-PER
Walker I-PER
from O
2011 O
to O
2019 O
, O
and O
Republicans O
control O
both O
chambers O
of O
the O
state O
legislature O
. O

We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool O
, O
said O
Joe B-PER
Zepecki I-PER
, O
a O
Democratic O
operative O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
fights O
around O
union O
rights O
in O
2011 O
and O
2012 O
led O
to O
the O
state O
being O
deeply O
polarized O
long O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
. O

So O
that O
shrinking O
segment O
of O
swing O
voters O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
ball O
game O

Yes O
, O
the O
political O
environment O
may O
be O
bad O
, O
but O
Republicans’ B-ORG
brand O
is O
rotten O
with O
those O
voters O
. O

This O
is O
why O
political O
watchers O
like O
Franklin B-PER
and O
others O
expect O
a O
deluge O
of O
negative O
ads O
in O
the O
contest O
, O
with O
both O
sides O
running O
campaigns O
that O
“ O
reflect O
that O
polarization O
that O
we O
have O
had O
for O
a O
good O
12 O
years O
.” O

Democrats O
are O
confident O
that O
if O
they O
can O
turn O
the O
race O
into O
a O
referendum O
on O
Johnson B-PER
, O
there O
are O
enough O
votes O
who O
have O
backed O
him O
in O
the O
past O
who O
are O
ready O
for O
an O
alternative O
. O

There O
is O
absolutely O
a O
world O
of O
ticket O
splitters O
, O
a O
world O
of O
persuadable O
voters O
and O
a O
world O
of O
people O
who O
might O
or O
might O
turn O
out O
, O
said O
Ben B-PER
Wikler I-PER
, O
chair O
of O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
of O
Wisconsin B-LOC

Democrats O
do O
however O
face O
a O
difficult O
national O
environment O
, O
with O
President O
Joe B-PER

poll O

slumping O

skeptical O
of O
Democratic O

With O
this O
in O
mind O
, O
Barnes B-PER
argued O
it O
would O
be O
Wisconsin B-LOC
Gov. O
Tony B-PER
Evers I-PER
– O
not O
the O

who O
would O
have O
the O
most O

on O
the O

Evers O
himself O
is O
up O
for O
reelection O

While O
he O
did O
not O
have O
a O
primary O
challenge O
, O
he O
will O
likely O
face O
a O
tough O
race O
against O
whoever O
emerges O
from O
what O
has O
been O
a O
tight O
Republican O
primary O
race O
on O
Tuesday O

This O

the O

Tesla B-ORG
officially O
announced O
a O
three-for-one O
stock O
split O

meaning O
the O
company’s O
stock O
price O
— O
which O
has O
jockeyed O
between O
$600 O
and O
$1,000 O
for O
a O
year O
— O
is O
about O
to O
get O
more O
affordable O
for O
investors O
. O

The O
stock O
will O
begin O
trading O
on O
a O
split-adjusted O
basis O
on O
August B-LOC
25th O
. O

Tesla B-ORG
(TSLA) O
shareholders O
approved O
the O
split O
Thursday O
at O
the O
company’s O
annual O
shareholders’ O
meeting O

Following O
the O
split O
, O
a O
person O
who O
owned O
one O
share O
of O
the O
company O
will O
hold O
three O
, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
each O
of O
those O
shares O
will O
be O
one-third O
of O
the O
price O
at O
that O
time O
. O

At O
Friday’s O
closing O
price O
of O
roughly O
$865 O
, O
that O
would O
make O
the O
post-split O
price O
per O
share O
just O
about O
$288 O
. O

Stock O
splits O
are O
usually O
done O
to O
increase O
a O
stock’s O
liquidity O
, O
making O
it O
easier O
for O
investors O
to O
buy O
and O
sell O
the O
shares O
. O

Essentially O
, O
the O
move O
will O
triple O
the O
number O
of O
Tesla B-ORG
shares O
on O
the O
market O
, O
but O
the O
company’s O
overall O
valuation O
— O
and O
the O
value O
of O
each O
investor’s O
holding O
— O
won’t O
change O
. O

Splits O
can O
also O
boost O
demand O
for O
a O
stock O
because O
it O
puts O
the O
price O
within O
the O
reach O
of O
smaller O
, O
individual O
investors O
. O

Tesla’s B-ORG
made O
such O
a O

Covid-19 O

Dr. O
Leana B-PER
Wen I-PER
: O
Monkeypox O
is O
not O

Covid-19 O

As O
we O

, O
Covid-19 O
is O
highly O
transmissible O
and O
can O
be O
spread O
through O
microscopic O
aerosols O

That O
means O
you O
could O
be O
infected O
by O
someone O
who O
you’re O
having O
a O
casual O
conversation O
with O
or O
even O
someone O
who O

in O

as O
you O

Monkeypox O
is O
primarily O
spread O
through O
prolonged O
, O
direct O
, O
skin-to-skin O
contact O
. O

Most O
cases O
thus O
far O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
sexual O
activity O
though O
this O
is O
not O
considered O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O

Rather, O
individuals O
can O
spread O
monkeypox O
through O
intimate O
contact, O
such O
as O
kissing, O
hugging, O
cuddling O
and O
sexual O
intercourse. O

Individuals O
who O
have O
lesions O
can O
also O
shed O
virus O
onto O
bedsheets O
, O
towels O
and O
other O
linens O
that O
can O
spread O
the O
virus O
to O
others O
. O

This O
is O
why O
people O
with O
active O
monkeypox O
lesions O
are O
instructed O
not O
to O
share O
potentially O
contaminated O
items O
like O
linens O
, O
towels O
, O
drinking O

CNN B-ORG
: O
What O
kinds O
of O
symptoms O
do O
patients O
with O
monkeypox O
have O
? O

Wen B-PER
: O
People O
who O
contract O
monkeypox O
often O
first O
start O
developing O
fever O
, O
headache O
, O
muscles O
aches O
and O
overall O
fatigue O
— O
similar O
to O
many O
other O
viral O
illnesses O
. O

Many O
people O
also O
have O
lymph O
node O
swelling O

They O
then O
develop O
a O
rash O
that O
progresses O
into O
blisters O
, O
pimples O
or O
sores O
. O

The O
lesions O
can O
be O
all O
over O
the O
body O
or O
only O
in O
one O
part O
. O

It O
could O
be O
localized O
to O
just O
the O
anal O
or O
genital O
area O
, O
on O
the O
face O
, O
inside O
the O
mouth O
, O
or O
any O
other O
part O
of O

A O
large O
study O
recently O
published O

New B-ORG

Medicine I-ORG
examined O
528 O
infections O
across O
43 O
sites O
in O
16 O
countries O

It O
found O
that O
the O
most O
common O
symptoms O
are O
fever O
, O
tiredness O
, O
muscle O
aches O
and O
lymph O
node O
swelling O
. O

Nearly O
all O
had O
a O
rash O
with O
blisters O
, O
though O
some O
individuals O
only O
had O
one O
lesion O
while O
others O
had O
several O
or O
more O
. O

Some O
people O
only O
had O
sores O
inside O
their O
mouth O
or O
in O
their O
anal O
or O
genital O
areas O
. O

Clinicians O
seeing O
patients O
with O
a O
fever O
and O
new O
rash O
should O
have O
a O
low O
threshold O
for O
testing O
for O
monkeypox O
, O
especially O
if O
the O
patient O
is O
in O
a O
high-risk O
group O
for O
contracting O
monkeypox O
. O

Importantly O
, O
the O
recent O
study O
also O
found O
that O
29% O
of O
people O
diagnosed O
with O
monkeypox O
had O
a O
sexually O
transmitted O
infection O
. O

To O
me O
, O
this O
means O
that O
just O
because O
a O
patient O
is O
diagnosed O
with O
one O
thing O
doesn’t O
mean O
they O
can’t O
have O
another O
, O
too O
, O
and O
patients O
in O
high-risk O
groups O
who O
have O
new O
lesions O
need O
to O
get O
tested O
to O
rule O
out O

it O

Wen O
: O
No O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
is O
extremely O
limited O
right O
now O
. O

About O
600,000 O
doses O
of O
the O
two-dose O
vaccine O
have O
been O
delivered O
thus O
far O
, O
much O
less O
than O
the O
1.5 O
million O
to O
1.6 O
million O
people O
the O
CDC B-ORG
says O
are O
eligible O
. O

Those O
who O
should O
definitely O
get O
the O
vaccine O
are O
those O
with O
known O
exposure O
to O
someone O
with O
monkeypox O
. O

If O
given O
within O
four O
days O
of O
exposure O
, O
the O
vaccine O
can O
prevent O
someone O
from O
developing O
monkeypox O
. O

If O
given O
within O
two O
weeks O
, O
it O
lessens O
the O
likelihood O
of O
progression O
to O
severe O
illness O

Soon O

I O
hope O
there O
will O
be O
enough O
vaccine O
so O
that O
people O

But O

most O

House O
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi’s I-PER
visit O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
already O
set O
off O
a O
fierce O
rhetorical O
response O
between O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
and O
China B-LOC
and O
sparked O
fears O
in O
Washington B-LOC
that O
Beijing B-LOC
will O
engineer O
an O
unprecedented O
escalation O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC

Yet O
neither O
the O
United B-LOC

nor O
China B-LOC
has O
any O
real O
interest O
in O
their O
budding O
superpower O
rivalry O
boiling O
over O
into O
open O
military O
clashes O
at O
this O
point O
, O
despite O
the O
soaring O
tensions O
caused O
by O
her O
arrival O
on O
Tuesday O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
the O
showdown O
is O
over O
the O
issue O
that O
is O
more O
likely O
than O
any O
other O
to O
spark O
a O
future O
US-China O
war O
. O

And O
Pelosi’s B-PER
trip O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
create O
greater O
instability O
in O
the O
relationship O
that O
would O
make O
future O
conflict O
more O
likely O

Furious O
Chinese O
warnings O
that O
the O
California B-LOC
Democrat O
shouldn’t O
go O
and O
Washington’s B-LOC
vows O
not O
to O
be O
intimidated O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
show O
how O
inflamed O
political O
forces O
in O
each O
nation O
could O
make O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
manage O
the O
world’s O
most O
sensitive O
geopolitical O
duel O
. O

Pelosi B-PER
and O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
that O
accompanied O
her O
said O
in O
a O
statement O
on O
Tuesday O
that O
the O
visit O
“honors O
America’s B-LOC
unwavering O
commitment O
to O
supporting O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
vibrant O
democracy.” O

The O
long-time O
critic O
of O
the O
Chinese B-LOC
communist O
government O
and O
its O
alleged O
human O
rights O
abuses O
arrived O
in O
Taipei B-LOC
despite O
extraordinary O
warnings O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
of O
reprisals O
and O
consequences O

Ahead O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
arrival O
, O
rhetoric O
was O
flying O
between O
Washington B-LOC
and O
Beijing B-LOC
. O

US O
national O
security O
adviser O
Jake B-PER
Sullivan I-PER
said O
on O
NBC’s B-ORG
“Today” O
that O
China B-LOC
“should O
think O
very O
carefully” O
about O
escalating O
the O
situation O
and O
warned O
the O
US B-LOC
would O
do O
whatever O
was O
necessary O
to O
protect O
its O
interests O

But O
China B-LOC
’s O
Foreign O
Minister O
Wang B-PER
Yi I-PER
renewed O
President O
Xi B-PER
Jinping I-PER
’s O
warning O
in O
a O
call O
to O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
last O
week O
that O
Washington B-LOC
should O
not O
“play O
with O
fire O
” O
on O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
reiterated O
Beijing B-LOC
’s O
“One O
China B-LOC
” O
policy O

Pelosi’s B-PER
position O
and O
new O
conditions O
created O
by O
the O
nationalistic O
rule O
of O
Xi B-PER
, O
as O
well O
as O
Beijing’s B-LOC
new O
assertiveness O
and O
military O
and O
strategic O
power O
, O
make O
this O
the O
most O
risky O
brinkmanship O
over O
Taiwan B-LOC
in O
decades O
. O

Given O
that O
Pelosi B-PER
is O
in O
Taipei B-LOC
, O
the O
question O
has O
now O
become O
how O
Beijing B-LOC
will O
respond O
. O

Most O
of O
its O
options O
– O
following O
a O
barrage O
of O
threats O
and O
propaganda O
that O
have O
raised O
expectations O
for O
its O
riposte O
– O
are O
quite O
alarming O

Most O
analysts O
think O
that O
some O
kind O
of O
military O
show O
of O
force O
is O
likely O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
China B-LOC
has O
already O
been O
sending O
its O
jets O
into O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
air O
defense O
identification O
zone O
in O
unprecedented O
numbers O
. O

While O
China B-LOC
’s O
moves O
may O
not O
directly O
threaten O
US B-LOC
naval O
forces O
in O
the O
area O
, O
they O
could O
add O
to O
the O
potential O
for O
miscalculations O
– O
and O
also O
raise O
the O
prospect O
of O
how O
Taiwan B-LOC
would O
respond O
to O
serious O
provocations O
. O

Why O
would O
Pelosi B-PER
go O
? O

So O
why O
did O
Pelosi B-PER
go O
and O
would O
her O
trip O
needlessly O
antagonize O
China’s B-LOC
leadership O
? O

Supporters O
of O
the O
visit O
, O
who O
unusually O
include O
many O
Republicans O
lined O
up O
behind O
Pelosi B-PER
, O
say O
it’s O
critical O
for O
the O
speaker O
to O
show O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
to O
underscore O
Washington B-LOC
is O
serious O
about O
its O
legal O
commitment O
to O
offer O
the O
island O
the O
means O
of O
its O
self-defense O
. O

Pelosi B-PER
is O
also O
a O
symbol O
of O
democracy O
– O
a O
way O
of O
life O
that O
Taipei B-LOC
is O
desperate O
to O
preserve O
under O
China’s B-LOC
authoritarian O
shadow O

But O
the O
controversy O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

This O
is O
about O
a O
broader O
context O
of O
China’s B-LOC
building O
challenge O
to O
America’s B-LOC
determination O
to O
preserve O
democracy O
, O
Western O
values O
and O
military O
and O
economic O
primacy O
in O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
and O
across O
the O
world O
. O

Once O
news O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
expected O
visit O
leaked O
, O
it O
became O
politically O
implausible O
– O
domestically O
and O
for O
strategic O
reasons O
– O
for O
her O
to O
bend O
to O
Beijing’s B-LOC
warnings O
that O
she O
should O
not O
go O
. O

It O
would O
be O
unpalatable O
for O
Pelosi B-PER
, O
following O
a O
political O
career O
partly O
defined O
by O
standing O
up O
to O
China B-LOC
, O
to O
give O
up O
on O
her O
plan O
. O

And O
it O
would O
send O
a O
message O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
first O
standoffs O
with O
a O
newly O
confident O
superpower O
rival O
in O
the O
Pacific O
, O
would O
back O
down O
. O

Biden O
also O
had O
political O
considerations O

While O
he O
publicly O
admitted O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
visit O
, O
he O
could O
not O
openly O
side O
with O
China B-LOC
over O
Pelosi B-PER

And O
a O
President O
can O
hardly O
order O
one O
of O
the O
top O
representatives O
of O
another O
branch O
of O
government O
what O
she O
should O
and O
should O
not O
do O
, O
even O
if O
officials O
worked O
to O
apprise O
the O
speaker O
of O
all O
the O
potential O
consequences O
of O
her O
decision O
. O

Politics O
are O
driving O
China’s B-LOC
actions O
too O
Politics O
rage O
within O
the O
Chinese B-LOC
politburo O
, O
too O
, O
though O
many O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
often O
view O
China’s B-LOC
communist O
leadership O
as O
monolithic O

Xi O
built O
his O
power O
base O
on O
aggressive O
nationalism O
and O
the O
idea O
that O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
destiny O
is O
“reunification” O
with O
the O
mainland O
. O

He O
is O
determined O
to O
preside O
over O
a O
national O
rejuvenation O
that O
will O
purge O
China’s B-LOC
past O
humiliation O
over O
colonialism O
and O
long O
20th O
century O
isolation O
when O
it O
did O
not O
wield O
what O
he O
views O
as O
its O
rightful O
influence O
in O
the O
world O

So O
Pelosi B-PER
’s O
expected O
visit O
is O
more O
than O
a O
jab O
at O
China B-LOC
; O
it O
’s O
a O
personal O
slight O
to O
Xi B-PER
’s O
core O
project O
by O
one O
of O
the O
most O
senior O
US B-ORG
politicians O
– O
and O
is O
one O
that O
demands O
a O
political O
response O

The O
crisis O
also O
comes O
at O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
. O

In O
a O
few O
months O
, O
Xi B-PER
is O
poised O
to O
claim O
an O
unusual O
third O
term O
and O
he O
cannot O
afford O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
weak O
. O

And O
his O
government’s O
questionable O
handling O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
– O
mass O
lockdowns O
are O
still O
common O
in O
Chinese B-LOC
cities O
– O
and O
a O
slowing O
economy O
, O
mean O
Xi B-PER
could O
be O
tempted O
into O
a O
nationalistic O
stand O
to O
mask O
domestic O
liabilities O
. O

A O
long O
festering O
dispute O
While O
the O
current O
standoff O
is O
alarming O
, O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
long O
been O
an O
irritant O
in O
US-China B-LOC
relations O
. O

The O
dispute O
is O
made O
even O
more O
confusing O
by O
complicated O
diplomatic O
agreements O
and O
nuanced O
US B-LOC
strategic O
doctrines O
designed O
to O
avoid O
the O
possibility O
of O
war O
with O
China B-LOC

The O
island O
is O
viewed O
by O
Beijing B-LOC
as O
a O
rightful O
part O
of O
its O
territory O

The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
recognizes O
the O
People’s B-ORG
Republic I-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
on O
the O
mainland O
as O
the O
sole O
legitimate O
government O
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
and O
doesn’t O
regard O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
a O
country O

But O
it O
doesn’t O
accept O
the O
Chinese O
Communist O
Party’s O
claim O
of O
sovereignty O
over O
the O
democratic O
island O

While O
it O
offers O
Taiwan B-LOC
the O
means O
of O
self O
defense O
when O
it O
buys O
US B-LOC
made O
weapons O
, O
Washington B-LOC
has O
adopted O
a O
policy O
of O
purposeful O
vagueness O
over O
whether O
it O
would O
itself O
defend O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
partly O
to O
deter O
a O
declaration O
of O
independence O
from O

and O
to O
give O
leaders O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
second O
thoughts O
about O

of O
the O

. O

Robert B-PER

an O

I O
don’t O

that O
we O
will O

at O

this O
time O
around O

but O
I O
don’t O
think O
we O
will O
be O
better O
off O
in O
our O
relations O
with O
Beijing B-LOC

Why O
Biden B-PER
worries O
about O
the O
trip O
Biden B-PER
has O
reorganized O
US O
foreign O
policy O
around O
the O
principle O
of O
countering O
China’s B-LOC
growing O
might O
in O
Asia B-LOC
and O
further O
afield O

Thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
Washington B-LOC
hoped O
that O
by O
encouraging O
then-reclusive O
China B-LOC
into O
the O
global O
economy O
it O
could O
promote O
political O
liberalization O
and O
usher O
it O
into O
the O
Western-oriented O
global O
economic O
and O
political O
system O
. O

But O
Beijing B-LOC
has O
sought O
to O
use O
its O
rising O
military O
and O
political O
power O
and O
influence O
to O
build O
an O
alternative O
political O
and O
economic O
value O
system O
to O
the O
one O
represented O
by O
the O
US B-ORG
and O
its O
allies O
. O

But O
Biden B-PER
also O
wants O
to O
manage O
this O
new O
competitive O
relationship O
so O
that O
it O
does O
not O
result O
in O
war O
between O
the O
rising O
power O
in O
the O
Pacific O
( O
China B-LOC
) O
and O
the O
existing O
one O
( O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
) O
and O
its O
allies O
. O

The O
US B-LOC
leader O
stressed O
in O
a O
telephone O
call O
with O
Xi B-PER
last O
week O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
change O
to O
the O
fundamental O
nature O
of O
US-China B-LOC
relations O
or O
the O
position O
of O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC

Yet O
seen O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
Biden’s B-PER
repeated O
recent O
statements O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
would O
defend O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
which O
were O
all O
walked O
back O
by O
aides O
, O
may O
have O
left O
an O
impression O
that O
he O
is O
not O
sincere O
. O

China B-LOC
is O
also O
watching O
a O
growing O
movement O
among O
hawks O
in O
Congress B-ORG
for O
Washington B-LOC
to O
replace O
the O
policy O
of O
“strategic O
ambiguity” O
over O
US O
intentions O
if O
China B-LOC
invades O
Taiwan B-LOC
for O
a O
clear O
statement O
that O
the O
US O
would O
defend O
the O
island O

Some O
analysts O
say O
such O
a O
shift O
could O
not O
only O
risk O
dragging O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
into O
a O
war O
in O
the O
Pacific O
against O
China B-LOC
that O
Americans O
are O
not O
prepared O
for O
, O
but O
that O
it O
could O
also O
make O
Beijing B-LOC
even O
more O
aggressive O
. O

Or O
that O
the O
promise O
of O
a O
US O
shield O
could O
embolden O
a O
push O
for O
independence O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
could O
also O
force O
China’s B-LOC
hand O
and O
bring O
a O
broader O
military O
conflict O
over O
the O
island O
closer O

Ahead O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit O
, O
official O
statements O
by O
administration O
officials O
firmly O
restated O
that O
there O
had O
been O
no O
change O
to O
US B-ORG
policy O
and O
affirmed O
her O
right O
to O
travel O
but O
hinted O
at O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
rocky O
few O
weeks O
when O
China B-LOC
responds O
in O
whatever O
form O
. O

There’s O
no O
reason O
for O
the O
Chinese O
rhetoric O

There’s O
no O
reason O
for O
any O
actions O
to O
be O
taken O

It O
is O
not O
uncommon O
for O
congressional O
leaders O
to O
travel O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
,” O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
’s O
National B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
coordinator O
for O
strategic O
communications O
John B-PER
Kirby I-PER
said O
during O
an O
appearance O
on O
CNN B-ORG
’s O
“New B-ORG
Day I-ORG
” O
on O
Monday O
.” O

We O
shouldn’t O
be O
, O
as O
a O
country O
, O
intimidated O
by O
that O
rhetoric O
or O
those O
potential O
actions O
. O

But O
in O
a O
new O
statement O
on O
Monday O
, O
Zhang B-PER
Jun I-PER
, O
the O
Chinese O
ambassador O
to O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
, O
warned O
again O
that O
China’s O
military O
would O
not O
“ O
sit O
by O
idly O
” O
as O
Pelosi B-PER
visits O
and O
that O
her O
trip O
would O
have O
an O
“ O
egregious O
political O
impact O
. O

The O
assumption O
in O
Washington B-LOC
is O
that O
Xi O
has O
no O
more O
interest O
in O
a O
direct O
military O
showdown O
than O
Biden B-PER
does O

But O
he’s O
stronger O
than O
previous O
Chinese O
leaders O
. O

And O
there O
is O
a O
strongly O
nationalist O
streak O
within O
the O
Chinese B-LOC
military O
along O
with O
growing O
confidence O
about O
its O
capacity O

So O
making O
assumptions O
about O
how O
China B-LOC
would O
respond O
to O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit O
based O
on O
its O
behavior O
in O
past O
crises O
that O
have O
blown O
over O
might O
mean O
the O
US B-LOC
is O
in O
for O
an O
unpleasant O

President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
said O
Monday O
he O
was O
concerned O
about O
China’s B-LOC
recent O
military O
exercises O
around O
Taiwan B-LOC
but O
that O
he O
didn’t O
believe O
China B-LOC
would O
take O
additional O
action O
as O
it O
escalates O
tensions O
following O
House B-ORG
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi’s I-PER
visit O

China B-LOC
has O
spent O
several O
days O
conducting O
military O
drills O
that O
have O
essentially O
encircled O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
restricted O
access O
to O
civilian O
ships O
and O
aircraft O
in O
the O
area O

The O
extensive O
exercises O
mark O
a O
significant O
escalation O
by O
China B-LOC
after O
Pelosi’s B-PER
trip O
to O
Taipei B-LOC
to O
show O
support O
for O
democracy O
on O
the O
island O
, O
which O
prompted O
outrage O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
. O

China B-LOC
views O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
its O
territory O
despite O
never O
having O
controlled O
it O

I’m O
not O
worried O
, O
but O
I’m O
concerned O
that O
they’re O
moving O
as O
much O
as O
they O
are O
. O

But O
I O
don’t O
think O
they’re O
going O
to O
do O
anything O
more,” O
Biden B-PER
told O
reporters O
on O
Monday O
before O
departing O
for O
Kentucky B-LOC

Tensions O
continue O
to O
escalate O
in O
the O
region O
as O
China B-LOC
floods O
the O

and O

around O
Taiwan B-LOC
with O
ships O
and O
jets O
and O
conducts O
live-fire O
drills O
and O
missile O
launches O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
drills O
, O
Beijing B-LOC
has O
canceled O
future O
phone O
calls O
between O
Chinese O
and O
US O
defense O
leaders O
, O
suspended O
bilateral O
climate O

White B-LOC

Karine B-PER
Jean-Pierre I-PER
said O
Monday O
Beijing’s B-LOC
military O
drills O
are O
“provocative, O
irresponsible O
and O
raise O
the O
risk O
of O
miscalculation.” O

We O
condemn O
these O
actions O
, O
we O
have O
, O
we’ve O
been O
condemning O
them O
since O
they O

take O
this O

it O

on O
whether O

Lewis I-PER
$150 O
million O

Fighting O
back O
tears O
at O
times O

Heslin B-PER
told O

that O
Jones B-PER
, O
through O
his O

organization O
Infowars B-ORG
, O
“tarnished O
the O

Heslin O
said O
that O
he O
couldn’t O
“ O
even O

describe O
the O
last O
nine-and-a-half O
years O

he O
has O
endured O
because O
of O

There’s O
got O

a O
strong O
deterrent O
that O

prevent O
him O
from O
peddling O
this O

,” O
Heslin B-PER
said O
, O
adding O
that O
through O
his O
testimony O
he O
wanted O
“ O
to O
restore O
my O
credibility O

my O
reputation O

Jesse’s B-PER

so O

Jones O
, O
who O

the O
first O

testimony O

Heslin O
called O
that O
absence O
“ O
a O
cowardly O
act O

I O
’ve O
been O
here O
for O
a O
week O

a O
half O
and O
[ O
during O
] O
my O
final O
testimony O
Mr. O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
does O
not O
have O
the O
courage O
to O
sit O
in O
front O
of O
me O
or O
face O
me O
,” O
Heslin B-PER
said O
. O

An O
attorney O
representing O
Heslin O
and O
Lewis O
told O
CNN B-ORG
the O
two O
have O
needed O
to O
be O
in O
isolation O
and O
under O
the O
protection O
of O
professional O
security O
during O
the O
trial O

Heslin B-PER
also O
said O
on O
the O
stand O
that O
the O
lie O
pushed O
by O
Jones B-PER
“resonates O
around O
the O
world” O
and O
that O
he O
has O
realized O
“how O
dangerous” O
it O
is. O

Heslin O
described O
being O
repeatedly O
confronted O
by O
those O
who O
believed O
Jones O
over O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
, O
saying O
such O
interactions O
occur O
“ O
right O
up O
to O
this O
day O
.” O

My O
life O
has O
been O
threatened O
,” O
Heslin B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

I O
fear O
for O
my O

I O
fear O

my O
safety O

my O

safety O

their O
life O

‘ O

Jesse O
was O
real O

I’m O
a O
real O
mom’ O
In O
a O
remarkable O
moment O
in O
court O
, O
Lewis B-PER
directly O
spoke O
to O
Jones B-PER
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
courtroom O
after O
the O
trial O
broke O
for O
lunch O
. O

She O
said O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
address O
Jones B-PER
to O
his O
face O
. O

Jesse O
was O
real,” O
Lewis B-PER
told O
Jones. B-PER

I’m O
a O
real O
mom O
. O

Lewis O
told O
Jones B-PER
that O
she O
thinks O
he O
didn’t O
actually O
believe O
the O
lies O
he O
pushed O
about O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC
. O

That’s O
the O
problem O
, O
I O
know O
you O
know O
that O
, O
” O
Lewis B-PER
told O
Jones B-PER
. O

But O
you O
keep O
saying O
it O

Why? O

Why? O

For O
money O
? O

Lewis O
said O
that O
“having O
a O
six-year-old O
son O
shot O
in O
the O
forehead” O
while O
at O
school O
is O
an O
“unbearable O
pain.” O

And O
then O
to O
have O
someone O
on O
top O
of O
that O
perpetuate O
a O
lie O
that O
it O
was O
a O
hoax O
, O
that O
it O
didn’t O
happen O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
false O
flag O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
an O
actress O
— O
You O
think O
I’m O
an O
actress O
? O

Lewis O
asked O

Lewis O
told O
the O
jury O
that O
monetary O
damages O
were O
appropriate O
in O
the O
case O
because O
she O
doesn’t O
believe O
Jones O
will O
ever O
stop O
. O

There O
has O
not O
been O
a O
sincere O
apology O
,” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

But O
if O
there O
was O
, O
ever O
, O
I O
liken O
it O
to O
being O
in O
a O
car O
accident O
and O
you O
run O
over O
someone O
and O
cause O
tremendous O
bodily O
damage O
and O
you O
look O
at O
that O
person O
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
say O
, O
‘ O
I’m O
so O
sorry O
, O
I’m O
so O
sorry O
, O
I’m O
not O
accountable O
for O
any O
of O
the O
damage O
I O
just O
caused O
. O

But O
I’m O
sorry O
.’ O

That’s O
how O
I O
see O
it O
. O

Regardless, O
Lewis B-PER
said O
that O
she O
does O
not O
believe O
Jones B-PER
understands O
the O
repercussions O
“of O
going O
on O
air O
with O
a O
huge O
audience O
and O
lying O
and O
calling O
this O
a O
hoax.” O

It O
seems O
so O
incredible O
to O
me O
that O
we O
have O
to O
do O
this O
,” O
Lewis B-PER
told O
Jones B-PER
. O

That O
we O
have O
to O
implore O
you O
— O
not O
just O
implore O
you O
, O
punish O
you O
— O
to O
get O
you O
to O
stop O
lying O
… O
It O
is O
surreal O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
here O
. O

Lewis O
also O
testified O
in O
court O
that O
she O
has O
been O
harassed O
and O
received O
death O
threats O
, O
including O
at O
her O
own O
home O
, O
all O
of O
which O
she O
said O

the O
wounds O
surrounding O
her O
son’s O
murder O
. O

The O
fear O
and O
anxiety O
and O
unsafeness O
… O
keeps O
me O
from O
healing O
,” O
Lewis B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

It O
definitely O
negatively O
impacts O
the O
healing O
process O
. O

Lewis O
described O
the O
conspiracy O
theories O
about O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC
as O
“deeply O
unsettling.” O

I O
feel O
compromised O
,” O
Lewis B-PER
said O
, O
describing O
how O
she O
feels O
about O
her O
own O
personal O
safety O
. O

Roy B-PER
Lubit I-PER

a O

was O

Lubit B-PER
told O
the O
court O
that O
Lewis B-PER

Heslin B-PER
“are O
very, O
very O
frightened.” O

When O
asked O
to O
specify O
who O
they O
are O
frightened O
of O
, O
Lubit B-PER
responded O
, O
“ O
Some O
follower O
of O

trying O
to O
kill O
them O

” O

Lubit B-PER
elaborated O
that O

sleeps O
with O
a O
gun O
, O
a O
knife O
, O
and O
pepper O
spray O
on O
her O

Lubit B-PER
added O
she O
won’t O
even O
turn O
on O
the O

during O
hot O
days O
for O
fear O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
hear O
an O

coming O

that O
she O
owns O
a O

keep O

telling O
the O
jury O
that O
she O

do O
everything O
in O

ensure O
that O
no O

This O
is O
not O

show’ O
Jones B-PER
took O
the O
stand O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
telling O
the O
court O

felt O
“good” O

he O
was O

afforded O
the O
opportunity O
to O
push O
back O
against O
the O
plaintiffs O
and O
news O

. O

From O
the O

Jones B-PER
told O
Heslin B-PER

, O
“ O
I O
never O

“the O

a O

questions” O
about O
the O
Sandy B-LOC

and O
so O
did O
he. O

Jones O
argued O
he O
simply O
had O
“tried O

out O
what O

happened.” O

After O
the O

following O
Jones’ O

Mark B-PER
Bankston I-PER

the O

Federico B-PER

of O
trying O

“poison” O

both O

Bankston B-PER

Jones B-PER
broke O
court O
orders O
when O
he O
attempted O
to O
discuss O
his O
net O
worth O
from O
the O

. O

Mr. O
Jones B-PER
just O
intentionally O
did O
that O
in O
violation O
of O
your O
order O
to O
attempt O
to O
poison O
this O

to O
try O

he’s O
not O

and O
that’s O
in O

, O
you O

“ O

You O

Gamble B-PER
added. O
“ O

You’ve O
already O
violated O

twice O
today O
, O
in O
just O
those O
two O

It O
seems O
absurd O
to O

“ O

This O

Gamble B-PER
added O
. O

Jones O
attempted O
to O
tell O
Gamble O
that O
he O
believed O
he O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
. O

You O
believe O
everything O
you O

but O
your O
beliefs O
do O
not O
make O
something O
true O
, O
Gamble B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

That O
is O
that O
is O
what O
we’re O
doing O
here O

Just O
because O

the O

Heslin B-PER

An O

“ O

“ O

One O
thing O
to O
talk O
about O
The O
news O
that O
Zahara B-PER
Jolie-Pitt I-PER
will O
be O
attending O
Spelman B-ORG
College I-ORG
in O
Atlanta B-LOC
is O
quite O
a O
boon O
to O
HBCUs O

As O
the O
daughter O
of O
Angelina B-PER
Jolie I-PER
and O
Brad B-PER
Pitt I-PER
, O
the O
teen O
had O
her O
choice O
of O
schools O
. O

And O
by O
choosing O
one O
of O
the O
best O
known O
of O
the O
historically O
Black O
colleges O
and O
universities O
to O
matriculate O
at O
, O
she O
brings O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
attention O
to O
the O
liberal O
arts O
college O
. O

Her O
mother O
proudly O
announced O
Jolie-Pitt’s B-PER
choice O
on O
social O
media O
, O
and O
the O
excitement O
for O
her O
was O
palpable O
. O

I O
get O
it O
, O
as O
I O
count O
several O
Spelman B-ORG
graduates O
as O
good O
friends O
. O

A O
supportive O
sisterhood O
awaits O
Jolie-Pitt B-PER
. O

Good O
luck O
to O
her O
and O
all O
the O
incoming O
freshmen O
across O
the O
nation O
this O
semester O

Something O
to O
sip O
on O
Inclusion O
isn’t O
just O
about O
race O

That’s O
the O
lesson O
that O
resonates O
with O
Beyoncé’s B-PER
agreeing O
to O
remove O
an O
ableist O
slur O
from O
her O
latest O
hit O
album O
, O
“Renaissance.” O

After O
complaints O
that O
the O
song O
“Heated” O
contained O
a O
term O
that O
is O
derogatory O
to O
people O
with O
spastic O
cerebral O
palsy O
, O
reps O
for O
the O
singer O
confirmed O
that O
“the O
word O
, O
not O
used O
intentionally O
in O
a O
harmful O
way O
, O
will O
be O
replaced O
. O

It’s O
a O
lesson O
that O
Lizzo B-PER
also O
learned O
in O
a O
similar O
situation O
in O
June O
. O

She O
, O
too O
, O
was O
quick O
to O
rectify O
the O
issue O
. O

Addressing O
these O
concerns O
goes O
beyond O
good O
public O
relations O
. O

It’s O
an O
example O
to O
us O
all O
about O
the O
need O
for O
sensitivity O
