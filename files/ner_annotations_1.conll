Sunday O
he O
hopes O
the O

I O
think O
it’s O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
legislation O
and O
on O
normal O
times O
, O
my O
Republican B-ORG
colleagues O
would O
be O
for O
something O
such O
as O
this O
. O

We’ve O
basically O
paid O
down O
debt O
, O
(which) O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O

We’ve O
accelerated O
permitting O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O

And O
we’ve O
increased O
production O
of O
energy O

which O

what O

We’ve O
done O
things O
that O
we O
should O
be O
doing O
together O

Will O

She O

about O
getting O
the O

of O
his O
Arizona B-LOC

Manchin B-PER
said O
on O
Sunday O
, O
“ O
We O
work O
very O
close O
together O
on O
so O
many O
things O
, O
and O
she O
has O
so O
much O
in O
this O
piece O
of O
legislation O

” O

She’s O
formed O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
and O
worked O
on O
it O
very O
hard O
.” O
“ O

I O
think O
that O
basically O
when O
she O
looks O
at O
the O
bill O
and O
sees O
the O
whole O
spectrum O
of O
what O
we’re O
doing O
… O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
positive O
about O
it O

but O
she’ll O
make O
her O
decision O

I O
respect O
that O

The O
Conservative B-ORG

made O
it O
clear O
over O
the O
weekend O
in O
Texas B-LOC
whose O
side O
it’s O
on O
in O
the O
fight O
against O
domestic O
terrorism O

First, O
it O
featured O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
as O
its O
star O
speaker. O

Here O
is O
a O
man O
who O
not O
only O
was O
allegedly O
involved O
in O
waging O
an O
attempted O
coup O
to O
overturn O
the O
2020 O
election O
but O
who O
also O
summoned O
his O
supporters O
to O
Washington B-LOC
on O
January O
6 O
, O
2021 O
, O
for O
a O
“wild” O
protest O
. O

Then O
on O
that O
fateful O
day O
, O
he O
inflamed O
them O
with O
his O
words O
and O
directed O
them O
to O
head O
to O
the O
US B-ORG
Capitol I-ORG
to O
“Stop O
the O
Steal.” O

And O
as O
some O
of O
his O
supporters O
brutally O
beat O
police O
officers O
, O
built O
gallows O
while O
chanting O
to O
hang O
his O
vice O
president O
and O
broke O
into O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
to O
try O
to O
stop O
Congress B-ORG
from O
certifying O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
’s O
win O
, O
Trump B-PER
did O
nothing O
for O
more O
than O
three O
hours O
to O
stop O
the O
attack O
. O

Trump B-PER
has O
denied O
responsibility O
for O
the O
insurrection O
. O

CPAC B-ORG
also O
welcomed O
as O
a O
speaker O
Viktor B-PER
Orban I-PER
, O
Hungary’s B-LOC
autocratic O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
who O
a O
week O
earlier O
had O
given O
a O
speech O
in O
which O
he O
declared O
that O
in O
Europe B-LOC
“ O
we O
do O
not O
want O
to O
become O
peoples O
of O
mixed O
race O
. O
” O

Those O
words O
prompted O
a O
longtime O
Orban B-PER
aide O
to O
resign O
, O
slamming O
his O
remarks O
as O
“pure O
Nazi O
text O
.” O

But O
the O
cherry O
on O
the O
sundae O
was O
a O
CPAC B-ORG
panel O
showcasing O
Brandon B-PER
Straka I-PER
, O
who O
pleaded O
guilty O
to O
disorderly O
conduct O
in O
the O
January O
6 O
attack O
, O
as O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
exhibit O
designed O
to O
elicit O
sympathy O
for O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
attackers O
still O
in O
prison O
. O

As O
part O
of O
his O
guilty O
plea O
to O
a O
misdemeanor O
, O
Straka B-PER
admitted O
to O
urging O
the O
violent O
mob O
to O
rip O
a O
riot O
shield O
from O
a O
police O
officer O
, O
shouting O
, O
“Take O
it O
: O
! O

Take O
it!,” O

The O
Washington B-ORG
Post I-ORG
reported O

Straka B-PER
ultimately O
received O
90 O
days’ O
home O
confinement O
and O
three O
years’ O
probation O
after O
agreeing O
to O
cooperate O
with O
law O
enforcement O

But O
just O
last O
week O
, O
a O
federal O
judge O
slammed O
Straka B-PER
for O
making O
public O
comments O
inconsistent O
with O
his O
statements O
to O
investigators O
, O
raising O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
could O
be O
charged O
with O
lying O
to O
federal O
authorities O
, O
NPR B-ORG
reported O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
Straka O
appeared O
on O
a O
CPAC B-ORG
panel O
with O
Republican O
Rep. O
Andy B-PER
Biggs I-PER
of O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
criticizing O
the O
House O
member O
for O
not O
doing O
more O
to O
help O
protesters O
who O
have O
been O
arrested O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
January O
6 O
riot O
and O
eliciting O
jeers O
from O
the O
audience O
for O
the O
lawmaker O
, O
according O
to O
Vice B-ORG
News I-ORG
. O

In O
an O
apparent O
effort O
to O
get O
into O
the O
crowd’s O
good O
graces O
, O
according O
to O
Vice B-ORG
News I-ORG
and O
video O
of O
the O
event O
, O
Biggs B-PER
then O
vowed O
to O
“ O
start O
defunding O
some O
of O
these O
bad O
agencies O
, O
the O
FBI B-ORG
, O
the O
DOJ B-ORG
.” O

Yes O
, O
a O
GOP O
member O
of O
Congress B-ORG
reportedly O
told O
the O
crowd O
that O
he O
would O
begin O
to O
defund O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
and O
FBI B-ORG
for O
having O
the O
audacity O
to O
prosecute O
January O
6 O
attackers O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
pièce O
de O
résistance O
: O
a O
headline-grabbing O
, O
jaw-dropping O
exhibit O
that O
featured O
a O
prison O
cell O
that O
housed O
a O
person O
dressed O
in O
an O
orange O
jumpsuit O
, O
wearing O
a O
red O
“Make O
America B-LOC
Great O
Again” O
cap O
. O

CPAC B-ORG
attendees O
were O
invited O
to O
put O
on O
headsets O
to O
listen O
to O
actual O
messages O
from O
the O
January O
6 O
attackers O

A O
CPAC B-ORG
representative O
told O
BuzzFeed B-ORG
News I-ORG
that O
the O
#Walk O
Away O
group O
founded O
by O
Straka B-PER
ran O
the O
booth O

In O
the O
past O
, O
CPAC B-ORG
has O
reportedly O
banned O
a O
booth O
from O
an O
atheist O
organization O
and O
the O
Log B-ORG
Cabin I-ORG
Republicans I-ORG
, O
an O
LGBT O

, O
as O
an O

. O

On O
Thursday O
, O
an O

played O
the O

, O
complete O
with O
tears O
as O
he O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
a O
chalkboard O
that O
read O
, O
“ O
Where O
is O
Everyone O
?” O

But O
on O
Friday O
– O
in O
a O
surreal O
case O
of O
life O
imitating O
art O
– O
Straka O
portrayed O
the O
prisoner O
in O
the O
cell O

Vice B-ORG
News I-ORG
reported O
that O
the O
line O
to O
see O
Straka O
stretched O
clear O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
exhibit O
hall O

It O
wasn’t O
long O
before O
right-wing O
firebrand O
Rep. O
Marjorie B-PER
Taylor I-PER
Greene I-PER
– O
who O
has O
long O
called O
the O
jailed O
January O
6 O
attackers O
“political O
prisoners” O
– O
entered O
the O
fake O
jail O
cell O
and O
led O
a O
prayer O
for O
those O
still O
imprisoned O
for O
their O
role O
in O
the O
January O
6 O
attack O
. O

Let’s O
put O
politics O
aside O
and O
look O
at O
the O
facts O

January O
6 O
was O
an O
act O
of O
“ O
domestic O
terrorism O
,” O
as O
FBI B-ORG
Director O
Christopher B-PER
Wray I-PER
testified O
before O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Just O
as O
we O
would O
call O
anyone O
involved O
in O
the O
far O
deadlier O
September B-LOC
11 O
, O
2001 O
, O
attacks O
“ O
terrorists O
” O
– O
we O
would O
do O
the O
same O
for O
anyone O
who O
played O
a O
role O
on O
January B-LOC
6 O
. O

For O
some O
people O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
calling O
a O
white O
American O
a O
terrorist O
is O
uncomfortable O
, O
but O
there’s O
no O
place O
for O
timidity O
when O
the O
stakes O
are O
this O
high O
. O

Those O
behind O
the O
mock O
jail O
cell O
at O
CPAC B-ORG
want O
you O
to O
have O
sympathy O
for O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
January B-LOC
6 O
attackers O

The O
overwhelmingly O
majority O
of O
people O
arrested O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
January B-LOC
6 O
attack O
have O
been O
granted O
bail O
, O
according O
to O
PolitiFact B-ORG
. O

Those O
defendants O
still O
in O
jail O
deserve O
to O
be O
there O
because O
of O
the O
severity O
of O
crimes O
with O
which O
they O
have O
been O
charged O

Among O
them O
are O
members O
of O
the O
Oath B-ORG
Keepers I-ORG
militia O
and O
the O
Proud B-ORG
Boys I-ORG
– O
some O
of O
whom O
were O
charged O
with O
“seditious O
conspiracy” O
– O
and O
others O
who O
are O
accused O
of O
brutally O
beating O
police O
officers O
and O
other O
heinous O
acts O
. O

Judges O
hearing O
the O
charges O
against O
these O
suspects O
have O
deemed O
that O
they O
pose O
a O
threat O
to O
the O
community O
were O
they O
to O
be O
released O
on O
bail O

Imagine O
if O
about O
18 O
months O
after O
a O
terrorist O
attack O
, O
a O
booth O
at O
a O
Democratic B-ORG
event O
attempted O
to O
elicit O
sympathy O
for O
those O
arrested O
for O
their O
role O
in O
a O
deadly O
strike O
on O
our O
nation O
! O

Critics O
would O
lash O
out O
at O
Democrats B-ORG
as O
unpatriotic O
Americans O
who O
support O
terrorism O
. O

And O
they O
would O
be O
right O
to O
do O
so O

That’s O
the O
same O
revulsion O
the O
vile O
display O
at O

One O
of O
the O
most O
important O
aspects O
of O
the O
weekend’s O
short O
but O
violent O
conflict O
between O
Israel B-LOC
and O
the O
Palestinian B-ORG
Islamic I-ORG
Jihad I-ORG
( O
PIJ O
) O
was O
what O
didn’t O
happen O
: O
Hamas’ O
involvement O

A O
ceasefire O
between O
Israel B-LOC
and O
the O
PIJ B-ORG
over O
Gaza B-LOC
that O
went O
into O
effect O
at O
11:30 O
p.m. O
local O
time O
( O
4:30 O
p.m. O
ET O
) O
Sunday O
appeared O
to O
be O
holding O
almost O
24 O
hours O
later O

The O
conflict O
led O
to O
the O
death O
of O
at O
least O
44 O
militants O
and O
civilians O
in O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
according O
to O
information O
from O
the O
Palestinian B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
. O

Fifteen O
of O
the O
dead O
were O
children O

Israel B-LOC
insists O
most O
of O
those O
killed O
were O
militants O
, O
and O
that O
several O
civilians O
were O
killed O
by O
failed O
militant O
rocket O
launches O
. O

Hamas B-ORG
, O
the O
militant O
group O
that O
runs O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
expressed O
support O
for O
the O
PIJ’s O
actions O
. O

But O
it O
kept O
its O
much O
larger O
and O
more O
powerful O
arsenal O
of O
rockets O
out O
of O
the O
equation O
, O
while O
Israel’s B-LOC
military O
made O
it O
clear O
from O
the O
outset O
they O
were O
focusing O
solely O
on O
PIJ O
targets O
. O

That O
kept O
the O
conflict O
from O
spiraling O
into O
a O
larger O
, O
more O
dangerous O
confrontation O
, O
and O
closer O
to O
what O
happened O
during O
the O
11-day O
war O
in O
May B-LOC
2021 O
. O

So O
why O
not O
get O
involved O
? O

According O
to O
analysts O
and O
Israeli B-LOC
officials O
, O
one O
reason O
is O
the O
fact O
it O
is O
still O
only O
15 O
months O
since O
the O
2021 O
conflict O
that O
led O
to O
considerable O
damage O
and O
death O
in O
Gaza B-LOC
. O

Palestinians O
there O
are O
still O
rebuilding O
their O
homes O
, O
and O
Hamas B-ORG
is O
rebuilding O
its O
arsenal O
. O

The O
Israeli B-LOC
government O
also O
believes O
its O
campaign O
of O
economic O
incentives O
– O
boosting O
the O
number O
of O
permits O
given O
to O
Gazans B-LOC
to O
cross O
into O
Israel B-LOC
for O
work O
– O
is O
succeeding O

Israel B-LOC
and O
Egypt B-LOC
have O
imposed O
a O
closure O
on O
Gaza B-LOC
since O
2007 O
, O
limiting O
access O
to O
the O
territory O
via O
land O
, O
air O
and O
sea O
, O
including O
tight O
restrictions O
on O
the O
movement O
of O
residents O
and O
the O
flow O
of O
goods O
. O

If O
rockets O
are O
fired O
, O
Israel B-LOC
closes O
the O
border O
and O
the O
thousands O
of O
Gazans O
with O
permits O
can’t O
work O
in O
Israel B-LOC
or O
get O
paid O
. O

On O
Monday O
, O
a O
senior O
Israeli B-LOC
diplomatic O
official O
said O
Hamas B-ORG
was O
“ O
an O
enemy O
not O
a O
partner O
… O
but O
there O
is O
cooperation O
we O
can O
do O
, O
predominantly O
through O
Egypt B-LOC
, O
to O
improve O
the O
situation O
in O
Gaza B-LOC
. O

For O
showing O
restraint O
, O
Hamas B-ORG
will O
expect O
to O
be O
rewarded O
. O

Lapid’s O
first O
big O
security O
test O
The O
weekend’s O
conflict O
was O
also O
the O
first O
major O
military O
test O
for O
interim O
Prime O
Minister O
Yair B-PER
Lapid I-PER

Unlike O
his O
predecessor O
Naftali B-PER
Bennett I-PER
, O
Lapid O
is O
not O
known O
for O
his O
military O
combat O
experience O
. O

But O
like O
US O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden’s I-PER
visit O
last O
month O
, O
it O
was O
another O
moment O
for O
Lapid B-PER
to O
look O
like O
a O
real O

Lapid B-PER

they O

The O
conflict O
also O
brought O
about O
another O
breakthrough O
, O
albeit O
on O
a O
somewhat O
smaller O
scale O
: O
former O
prime O
minister O
, O
now O
opposition O
leader O
Benjamin B-PER
Netanyahu I-PER
met O
with O
Lapid B-PER
on O
Sunday O
to O
receive O
a O
security O
briefing O
on O
the O
operation O
. O

It O
was O
his O
first O
security O
briefing O
since O
leaving O
power O
– O
even O
though O
by O
law O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
standard O
practice O
. O

Until O
this O
weekend O
, O
Netanyahu B-PER
had O
boycotted O
the O
meetings O
. O

After O
the O
meeting O
, O
Netanyahu B-PER
said O

Dry O
lightning O
has O
ignited O
some O
of O
the O
most O
destructive O
and O
costly O
wildfires O
in O
California B-LOC
history O
, O
a O
new O
study O
shows O
. O

Researchers O
found O
that O
over O
the O
past O
few O
decades O
, O
nearly O
half O
of O
the O
lightning O
strikes O
that O
hit O
the O
ground O
during O
spring O
and O
summer O
had O
been O
dry O
— O
there O
was O
no O
rain O
falling O
nearby O
. O

Dry O
lightning O
tends O
to O
happen O
in O
storms O
over O
areas O
of O
extreme O
drought O
, O
like O
the O
one O
California B-LOC
has O
been O
in O
for O
the O
past O
several O
years O
. O

The O
air O
is O
so O
dry O
that O
the O
rain O
evaporates O
before O
it O
hits O
the O
ground O

And O
the O
conditions O
that O
favor O
dry O

are O
becoming O
more O
widespread O
and O
more O
frequent O

pointed O
to O
the O
wildfires O
that O
scorched O
California B-LOC
in O
2020 O
— O
particularly O
the O
August B-LOC
Complex I-LOC
Fire I-LOC
, O
the O
largest O
wildfire O
in O
the O
state’s O
history O
— O
as O
the O
motivation O
for O
the O
research O
. O

The O
August B-LOC
Complex I-LOC
Fire I-LOC
was O
originally O
more O
than O
three O
dozen O
fires O
that O
were O
sparked O
by O
dry O
lightning O

Those O
fires O
merged O
to O
become O
the O
largest O
in O
state O
history O
, O
burning O
more O
than O
a O
million O
acres O
in O
seven O
counties O
. O

California B-LOC
firefighters O
were O
exhausted O
that O
summer O
, O
CNN B-ORG
reported O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
they O
were O
particularly O
concerned O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
more O
and O
more O
fires O
sparked O
by O
dry O
lightning O
. O

All O
of O
the O
seven O
largest O
fires O
in O
California B-LOC
history O
have O
occurred O
in O
the O
past O
five O
years O
, O
and O
four O
of O
those O
were O
caused O
by O
lightning O
, O
according O
to O
data O
from O
Cal B-ORG
Fire I-ORG
. O

With O
warming O
and O
drying O
and O
drier O
vegetation O
, O
it O
doesn’t O
take O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
lightning O
to O
start O
wildfires O
, O
” O
Kalashnikov B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

So O
even O
if O
, O
on O
the O
off O
chance O
, O
dry O
lightning O
decreases O
in O
the O
future O
, O
it O
just O
takes O
one O
outbreak O
one O
day O
in O
a O
year O
to O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
fire O
and O
a O
lot O
of O
damage O
, O
if O
that O
were O
to O
happen O
. O

The O
study O

funded O
by O
NASA B-ORG

published O
Monday O
in O

Climate I-ORG
, O
is O
the O
first O
to O
develop O

in O
California B-LOC

specifically O
focusing O
on O
Central B-LOC

Northern B-LOC
California I-LOC
, O
an O
area O
where O
lightning O
is O
a O
significant O
cause O
of O
wildfire O
. O

Dry O
lightning O
was O
found O
to O
occur O
most O
frequently O
in O
July B-LOC
and O
August B-LOC
, O
the O
researchers O
found O
, O
though O
lower O
elevation O
regions O
tended O
to O
see O
activity O
peak O
later O
in O
September B-LOC
and O
October B-LOC
, O
when O
vegetation O
is O
even O
drier O
. O

Researchers O
found O
that O
around O
Sacramento B-LOC
, O
San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
, O
Redwood B-LOC
, O
Sequoia B-LOC
and O
Yosemite B-LOC
, O
lightning O
sparked O
nearly O
30% O
, O
of O
fires O
which O
accounted O
for O
nearly O
50% O
of O
the O
total O
burned O
area O
. O

That O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fires O
started O
by O
lightning O
, O
which O
are O
usually O
more O
difficult O
to O
attack O
because O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
remote O
than O
human O
caused O
fires O
, O
Chris B-PER
Vagasky I-PER
, O
a O
meteorologist O

applications O
manager O
at O
Vaisala B-ORG
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

Vagasky B-PER
, O
who O
is O
not O
involved O
with O
the O
study O
, O
said O
the O
findings O
provide O
“excellent O
background” O
for O
weather O
forecasting O
and O
wildland O
management O
communities O
to O
better O
determine O
the O
conditions O
that O
are O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
occur O
in O
advance O
. O

This O
really O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O
understanding O
when O
dry O
lightning O
can O
be O
expected O
so O
that O
crews O
can O
be O
at O
the O
ready O
in O
the O
event O
of O
fire O
starting O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

So O
it’s O
good O
to O
see O
that O
there O
is O
now O
a O
study O
for O
this O
region O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
that O
shows O
not O
just O
the O
time O
of O

, O
but O
the O
type O
of O
meteorological O
conditions O
that O
appear O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
. O

The O
research O
is O
just O
the O
first O
step O
, O
Vagasky B-PER
said O
. O

When O
thunderstorms O
do O
develop O
, O
first O
responders O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
dry O
lightning O
conditions O
may O
be O
possible O
, O
but O
they O
will O
also O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
quickly O
respond O
to O
areas O
that O
are O
impacted O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

Kalashnikov B-PER
said O
there O
are O
still O
uncertainties O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
lightning O
research O
, O
whether O
dry O
lightning O
will O
occur O
more O
often O
as O
the O
climate O
changes O
. O

But O
one O
thing O
is O
certain O
, O
he O
said O
, O
as O
the O
Western B-LOC
drought O
persists O
, O
conditions O
are O
much O
more O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
take O
shape O
. O

In O
just O
the O
last O
year O
alone O
, O
dry O
lightning O
has O
sparked O
deadly O
and O
destructive O
wildfires O
such O
as O
the O
Bootleg B-LOC
Fire I-LOC
in O
Oregon B-LOC
that O
burned O
more O
than O
400,000 O
acres O

We O
know O
it’s O
getting O
hotter O
and O
drier O
— O
California B-LOC
is O
becoming O
hotter O
and O
drier O
,” O
Kalashnikov B-PER
said O
. O

So O
we O
can O
say O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
trend O
in O
lightning O
is O
doing O
, O
when O
lightning O
happens O
with O
a O
hotter O
, O
drier O
atmosphere O
and O
vegetation O
, O
it’s O
just O
going O
to O
lead O
to O
more O
of O
a O
risk O
of O
these O
kinds O
of O
wildfire O
outbreaks O
like O
we O
saw O
in O
2020 O

something O
the O

encountered O
before O

The O
blaze O
, O
the O
largest O

so O
far O
this O

broke O
out O
Friday O
afternoon O
in O
the O
Klamath B-LOC
National I-LOC

near O
the O
California-Oregon B-LOC

and O
grew O
rapidly O
over O
the O
weekend O
, O
fueled O
by O
explosive O
fire O
weather O
. O

The O
fire O
sprinted O
through O
dry O
brush O

, O
scorching O
more O
than O
56,000 O
acres O
and O
forcing O
thousands O

the O

advanced O
on O

The O

had O
zero O

– O
as O
well O
as O

over O
some O

Tuesday O
. O

I O
was O
really O
confused O
at O
first O
. O

I O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
forest O
fire O
,” O
explained O
Dailey B-PER
. O

Things O
just O
looked O
weird O
– O
there O
was O
this O
orange O
cast O
over O
the O
forest O
– O
and O
once O
I O
saw O
smoke O
rising O
from O
fire O
over O
top O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
I O
just O
panicked O
.” O

The O
couple O
and O
their O
roommate O
immediately O
packed O
all O
into O
their O
small O
car O
, O
leaving O
room O
for O
little O
else O
. O

I O
could O
see O
nothing O
but O
smoke O
and O
the O
fire O
coming O
down O
the O
mountain O
,” O
said O
Dailey B-PER
, O
who O
later O
learned O
the O
wildfire O
started O
just O
3 O
miles O
away O
before O
it O
raced O
for O
their O
home O
, O
the O
flames O
feasting O
on O
their O
belongings O
, O
including O
everything O
set O
aside O
for O
the O
new O
baby O
. O

Now, O
4 O
days O
past O
her O
due O
date, O
Dailey B-PER
has O
yet O
another O
new O
worry: O
The O
nearest O
hospital O
has O
been O
evacuated O
and O
she’s O
been O
warned O
that O
she O
will O
likely O
need O
to O
make O
a O
2-hour O
trek O
through O
the O
mountains O
to O
give O
birth O
at O
a O
hospital O
in O
Medford, B-LOC
Oregon. B-LOC

It O
remains O
unclear O
how O
many O
homes O
were O
lost O
, O
but O
forest O
officials O
said O
“numerous” O
structures O
were O
destroyed O
around O
the O
Klamath B-LOC

Four O
people O
have O
been O
found O
dead O
in O
the O

including O
two O
who O
were O
in O
a O

We O
don’t O
even O
have O
an O

anymore O
’ O
Valerie B-PER
Linfoot I-PER
and O
her O
husband O
, O
both O
retired O
forest O
firefighters O
, O
lost O
their O
home O
of O
more O
than O
three O
decades O
. O

We’ve O
fought O
fires O
and O
seen O
homes O
burn O
up O
and O
been O
in O
a O
place O
of O
being O
the O
firefighters O
there O
doing O
that O
work O
, O
but O
to O
have O
it O
happen O
to O
yourself O
, O
it’s O
just O
unimaginable O
, O
” O
Linfoot B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

I’m O
still O
overwhelmed O
that O
we’re O
the O
victims O
of O
this O
horrible O
, O
horrible O
convergence O
of O
weather O
and O
fire O
, O
which O
so O
many O
times O
we’ve O
seen O
other O
people O
suffer O
. O

Linfoot O
was O
out O
of O
town O
when O
the O
fire O
quickly O
advanced O
on O
her O
home O

Her O
husband O
, O
Chuck O
, O
saw O
the O
flames O
approach O
and O
packed O
up O
and O
left O

He O
drove O
to O
the O
community O
hall O
and O
looked O
back O
, O
seeing O
flames O
flanking O
their O
home O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

There’s O
nothing O
left O

It’s O
completely O
burned O
down O
to O
the O
dirt O

It’s O
just O
completely O
gone,” O
Linfoot B-PER
said. O

For O
Linfoot B-PER
, O
the O
hardest O
part O
is O
thinking O
about O
the O
irreplaceable O
items O
that O
were O
left O
behind O
when O
her O
home O
burned O
down O
. O

It’s O
a O
lot O
to O
take O
on O
in O
your O
mind O
thinking O
about O
those O
things O
that O
you’re O
never O
gonna O
get O
back,” O
she O
said. O
“ O

I O
left O
my O
wedding O
rings O
on O
my O
dresser O
and O
I’m O
never O
gonna O
get O
those O
back O

I O
have O
been O
married O
31 O
years O
and O
those O
are O
the O
rings O
that O
were O
put O
on O
my O
finger O
the O
day O
I O
said O
yes O

And O
they’re O
gone O
forever O
. O

Also O
lost O
in O
the O
fire O
were O
the O
ashes O
of O
Linfoot’s O
mother O
and O
grandmother O
, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
children’s O
baby O
photographs O
. O

We O
lost O
one O
of O
our O
sons O
about O
10 O
years O
ago O
in O
a O
motorcycle O
accident O

So O
the O
idea O
of O
not O
having O
any O
pictures… O
she O
said O

Linfoot O
has O
found O
comfort O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
community O
in O
Klamath B-LOC
River I-LOC
, O
and O
staying O
close O
with O
friends O
who O
are O
also O
dealing O
with O
the O
same O
losses O
. O

But O
she O
worries O
for O
her O
tightly O
knit O
community O
. O

It’s O
a O
small O
community O
and O
this O
is O
absolutely O
devastating O
to O
Klamath B-LOC
River I-LOC
,” O
she O
said O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
how O
they’re O
gonna O
recover O

None O
of O
us O
are O
rich O
people O

We’re O
all O
hardworking O
and O
resilient O
people O
, O
but O
most O
people O
that O
were O
down O
there O
are O
middle O
class O
, O
regular O
working O
folks O
or O
retirees O
. O

She O
said O
her O
family O
is O
exploring O
their O
options O
, O
but O
don’t O
think O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
rebuild O
. O

The O
Linfoots B-PER
set O
up O
a O
GoFundMe B-ORG

to O
help O
them O
with O
recovery O
and O
rebuilding O

It’s O
hard O
to O
convey O
to O
somebody O
what O
it’s O
like O
to O
know O
that O
you O
have O
nothing O

One O
of O

that O

CNN B-ORG

said O
that O
the O
fact O
that O

they O
believe O
he O
may O
have O
some O
significant O
exposure O
down O

line O

Actively O
engaging O
suggests O
to O
me O
that O
the O

think O
that O
there O
is O
some O
jeopardy O
here O
and O
they O
should O
engage O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O

Bharara B-PER
, O
a O

told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Wolf B-PER
Blitzer I-PER
. O

Bharara O
cautioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
could O
last O
a O
long O
time O
and O
that O
a O
decision O
“ O
about O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
charge O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
” O
could O
occur O
many O
months O
from O
now O

Learning O
what O
Trump B-PER
was O
saying O
and O
thinking O
as O
his O
mob O
smashed O
its O
way O
into O
the O
US B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC
and O
during O
his O
prior O
schemes O
designed O
to O
overturn O
his O
election O
loss O
could O
help O
establish O
whether O
the O
ex-President O
acted O
with O
corrupt O
intent O
and O
could O
be O
at O
risk O
of O
being O
criminally O
charged O

More O
immediately O
, O
the O
dialogue O
with O
Trump’s B-PER
lawyers O
could O
also O
be O
the O
curtain O
raiser O
to O
what O
may O
well O
be O
a O
critical O
legal O
fight O
over O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
Trump B-PER
– O
as O
an O
ex-President O
– O
can O
assert O
executive O
privilege O
over O
conversations O
and O
advice O
he O
received O
while O
in O
office O
. O

Such O
a O
case O
could O
go O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
and O
in O
itself O
break O
new O
legal O
ground O
since O
there O
is O
little O
litigation O
on O
the O
issue O
concerning O
out-of-office O
presidents O

Executive O
privilege O
is O
the O
custom O
under O
which O
private O
conversations O
and O
advice O
given O
to O
a O
president O
can O
remain O
private O
, O
especially O
from O
Congress B-ORG
, O
under O
the O
doctrine O
of O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

A O
long O
legal O
duel O
The O
potential O
legal O
battle O
that O
Trump’s O
often O
risible O
privilege O
claims O
may O
spark O
could O
push O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
investigation O
into O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
ex-President’s O
likely O
2024 O
campaign O

This O
would O
risk O
yet O
another O
national O
political O
conflagration O
on O
top O
of O
many O
ignited O
by O
the O
45th O
President O

But O
more O
broadly O
, O
the O
latest O
news O
about O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
inquiry O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
an O
aggressive O
criminal O
probe O
that O
is O
narrowing O
in O
on O
a O
former O
President O
of O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
– O
a O
historical O
watershed O
– O
after O
an O
administration O
that O
is O
still O
tearing O
at O
the O
guardrails O
of O
the O
democratic O
system O
even O
out O
of O
office O
. O

This O
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
Trump B-PER
will O
be O
charged O

A O
criminal O
investigation O
requires O
a O
far O
higher O
level O
of O
proof O
than O
the O
House B-ORG
select O
committee O
, O
which O
has O
painted O
a O
damning O
picture O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
actions O
ahead O
of O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
insurrection O
. O

And O
Trump B-PER
has O
made O
a O
life’s O
work O
of O
escaping O
legal O
scrapes O
and O
attempts O
to O
enforce O
accountability O

In O
his O
presidency O
alone O
, O
he O
wriggled O
free O
from O
the O
Russia B-LOC
investigation O
. O

He O
was O
the O
first O
President O
to O
be O
impeached O
twice O
by O
the O
House B-ORG
, O
although O
he O
wasn’t O
convicted O
in O
Senate B-ORG
trials O
or O
barred O
from O
future O
federal O
office O
. O

Still, O
according O
to O
the O
new O
CNN B-ORG
report, O
Trump’s O
team O
has O
warned O
him O
there O
may O
be O
indictments O
resulting O
from O
the O
grand O
jury O
investigation. O

And O
sources O
say O
the O
former O
President O
has O
asked O
his O
advisers O
whether O
he O
is O
in O
personal O
legal O
jeopardy O

a O

the O

told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Erin B-PER
Burnett I-PER
that O
the O
contacts O
between O

lawyers O
and O
prosecutors O
pointed O
to O
a O
legal O
joust O
over O
the O
scope O
of O

privilege O
. O

I O
think O
that O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
is O
going O
to O
lose O
that O
battle O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
lawyers O
are O
engaging O
in O
this O
and O
telling O
him O
that O
he O
better O
beware O
, O
indictments O
could O
come O
, O
I O
think O
is O
very O
serious O
news O
for O
the O
former O
President O
but O
very O
good O
news O
for O
democracy O
, O
the O
rule O

, O
” O
Wehle B-PER
said O

The O
latest O
revelations O
about O
the O
grand O
jury O
probe O
reinforce O
signs O
that O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
is O
acting O
with O
speed O
and O
expansive O
scope O
to O
investigate O
the O
insurrection O
following O
months O
of O
complaints O
– O
even O
from O
members O
of O
the O
House B-ORG
select O
committee O
– O
that O
it O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
that O
active O

This O
in O
turn O
raises O
the O
possibility O
that O
yet O
another O
significant O
period O
of O
national O
trauma O
caused O
by O
Trump B-PER
could O
lie O
ahead O

The O
former O
President O
has O
already O
claimed O
that O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
is O
weaponizing O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
to O
pursue O
its O
political O
enemies O
– O
a O
charge O
many O
critics O
leveled O
against O
him O
while O
he O
was O
still O
president O

Trump B-PER
would O
be O
sure O
to O
react O
to O
any O
signs O
that O
he O
is O
a O
target O
of O
the O
investigation O
or O
the O
possible O
indictments O
of O
those O
around O
him O
by O
claiming O
that O
he O
is O
being O
victimized O
by O
a O
politicized O
investigation O

Given O
his O
hold O
over O
his O
supporters O
, O
and O
a O
record O
of O
inciting O
violence O
, O
political O
tensions O
could O
become O
acute O
. O

All O
of O
this O
will O
sharpen O
the O
dilemma O
that O
Attorney O
General O
Merrick B-PER
Garland I-PER
would O
face O
if O
the O
evidence O
from O
the O
criminal O
probe O
suggests O
a O
prosecution O
is O
merited O

Indicting O
a O
former O
President O
– O
especially O
one O
running O
for O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
again O
– O
would O
incite O
a O
political O
storm O

This O
must O
raise O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
targeting O
Trump B-PER
would O
be O
in O
the O
broader O
national O
interest O
outside O
the O
criminal O
context O

At O
the O

time O
, O
failing O
to O
pursue O
an O
ex-President O
accused O
of O
helping O
to O
foment O
a O
coup O
attempt O
could O
create O
an O
equally O
dangerous O

two O

This O
comes O
as O
they O
await O
developments O
not O
solely O
in O
the O

in O

overturn O
Biden’s B-PER

Trump B-PER
has O
grilled O
his O
attorneys O
on O
whether O
they O
actually O
believe O
he O
will O
face O
formal O
charges O
, O
but O
he O
has O
expressed O
skepticism O
that O
he O
will O
be O
indicted O
, O
one O
of O
the O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
matter O
said O

The O
CNN B-ORG
team O
also O
reveals O
that O
Trump B-PER
has O
ignored O
advice O
from O
advisers O
to O
avoid O
speaking O
to O
former O
and O
current O
aides O
who O
have O
become O
entangled O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
select O
committee O
probe O
and O
could O
be O
drawn O
in O
by O
the O
criminal O
investigation O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
executive O
privilege O
, O
historical O
precedent O
could O
work O
against O
the O
former O
President O
. O

During O
the O
Watergate O
scandal O
, O
then-President O
Richard B-PER
Nixon I-PER
asserted O
executive O
privilege O
to O
try O
to O
prevent O
the O
handover O
of O
incriminating O
audio O
tapes O
. O

But O
in O
a O
ruling O
that O
could O
be O
significant O
in O
Trump’s B-PER
case O
, O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
said O
that O
executive O
privilege O
could O
not O
be O
used O
to O
thwart O
the O
administration O
of O
criminal O
justice O
. O

The O
House O
January O
6 O
committee O
did O
not O
litigate O
the O
question O
of O
Cipollone’s O
reluctance O
to O
talk O
about O
certain O
conversations O
with O
Trump B-PER
on O
the O
basis O
of O
executive O
privilege O

It O
is O
racing O
against O
a O
ticking O
clock O
since O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
disbanded O
by O
pro-Trump O
Republicans O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
if O
control O
of O
the O

the O
Justice B-ORG

has O
the O
luxury O

more O
time O
to O
conduct O
a O
legal O
fight O

And O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
prolonged O
investigation O
is O
one O
reason O
many O
observers O
believe O
Trump B-PER
is O
leaning O
toward O
an O
early O
announcement O
of O
a O
2024 O
presidential O
campaign O
, O
which O
would O
enable O
him O
to O
rile O
up O

by O
arguing O
that O

If O
you O
have O

you’re O
not O

Decades O
of O
the O
tech O
sector’s O
pressure O
to O
“innovate O
or O
die” O
have O
led O
to O
a O
long O
list O
of O
useful O
and O
flashy O
household O
tech O
products O
, O
but O
many O
of O
these O
same O
devices O
also O
have O
a O
need O
to O
be O
replaced O
at O
almost O
the O
same O
rapid O
rate O
that O
new O
technology O
emerges O
. O

The O
result O
of O
this O
so-called O
planned O
obsolescence O
, O
combined O
with O
a O
limited O
number O
of O
options O
to O
repair O
older O
devices O
over O
the O
years O
, O
is O
a O
tsunami O
of O
electronic O
waste O
, O
also O
known O
as O
e-waste O
. O

And O
the O
fallout O
from O
it O
extends O
far O
beyond O
the O
headache O
of O
figuring O
out O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
clutter O
tucked O
away O
inside O
your O
home O
. O

Planned O
obsolescence O
just O
makes O
it O
worse O

People O
now O
expect O
to O
get O

that O
just O
keeps O
growing O

The O
most O
recent O
United B-ORG

in O
2019 O
, O
and O
only O
17.4% O

The O

( O

warned O
last O

that O
the O
disposal O

cause O
a O
range O
of O
“adverse O

“actively O
engaged” O
in O
the O
informal O

, O
the O
WHO B-ORG
warned O
. O

Children O

adolescents O
are O
often O
used O
to O
scour O
through O
mountains O
of O
e-waste O
in O
search O
of O
valuable O
materials O
such O
as O
copper O
and O
gold O
“because O
their O
small O
hands O
are O
more O
dexterous O
than O
those O
of O

the O
WHO B-ORG
said. O

The O
issue O
of O

is O
“ O
all O
about O
environmental O
justice O
at O
the O
global O

Puckett B-PER

The O

now O
catching O
the O

of O

the O
EPA B-ORG

If O
you O
do O
decide O
to O
recycle O

the O
EPA B-ORG
urges O
consumers O
to O
remove O
any O
batteries O
that O
may O
need O
to O
be O
recycled O
separately O
. O

The O
agency O
says O
that O
recycling O
one O
million O
laptops O
saves O
the O
energy O
equivalent O
of O
the O
electricity O
used O
by O
more O
than O
3,500 O
US B-LOC
homes O
in O
a O
year O

For O
every O
one O
million O
cell O
phones O
that O
are O
recycled O
, O
the O
agency O
says O
35,000 O
pounds O
of O
copper O
, O
772 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
, O
75 O
pounds O
of O
gold O
and O
33 O
pounds O
of O
palladium O
can O
be O
recovered O
. O

Apart O
from O
these O
options O
, O
Seibert B-PER
simply O
urges O
consumers O
to O
start O
thinking O
about O
electronics O
like O
we O
think O
about O
cars O
: O
we O
don’t O
trash O
our O
vehicles O
when O
we O
need O
new O

or O
if O
the O
windshield O
cracks O
. O

Everybody O
wants O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
,” O
Seibert B-PER
said O
. O

So O
we’ve O
got O
to O
give O
them O
the O
resources O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
that’s O

“That O

an O

Then O
there O
is O
the O

while O
the O

Even O

protectionism O

up O

for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
, O
and O
that O
is O
concerning O
, O
” O
Dresden B-PER
said O
. O

The O
academic O
and O
think O
tank O
research O
has O
been O
really O
clear O
: O
Hungary B-LOC
has O
been O
on O
this O
incremental O
path O
( O
toward O

) O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
at O
this O
point O
, O
and O
Orbán B-PER
has O
followed O
the O
playbook O
very O
, O
very O
closely O
in O
ways O
that O
everybody O
should O
be O
worried O
about O

Her O

out O
seven O

” O
and O
offers O
guides O
as O
to O
how O

can O
recognize O

report O
on O

The O
steps O
used O
to O
gain O

range O
from O
trying O

control O
the O

to O
stoking O

and O
corrupting O

, O
according O
to O
the O
report O

Coverage O
of O
Orbán B-PER
at O

should O
include O
“ O
the O
fact O
that O

controlled O
by O

It O
should O
also O
include O
“the O

Another O
piece O
of O

is O
the O
timing O
of O

arrival O

Last O

such O

One O
year O
later O
, O
the O
state O
of O
our O
democracy O
has O
been O
further O
weakened O
by O
restrictive O
voting O
laws O
, O
Supreme O
Court O
rulings O
and O
continued O
amplification O
of O
lies O
by O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
and O
his O
allies O
about O
the O
2020 O
election O
. O

A O
growing O
number O
of O
citizens O
and O
analysts O
question O
whether O
our O
democracy O
can O
survive O
the O
assault O
it O
is O
under O

What O
does O
it O
say O
about O
the O
state O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
conversation O
of O
democracy O
today O
that O
a O
major O
conservative O
organization O
like O
CPAC B-ORG
is O
showcasing O
a O
leader O
who O
last O
month O
warned O
against O
“race O
mixing” O
in O
such O
racist O
language O
that O
it O
led O
to O
a O
20-year O
adviser O
of O
his O
resigning O
as O
she O
labeled O
his O
words O
a O
“pure O
Nazi O
text” O
? O

And O
he O
will O
be O
appearing O
on O
the O
same O
CPAC O
stage O
as O
former O
President O
Trump B-PER
and O
more O
than O
20 O
members O
of O
Congress O

You O
don’t O
want O
to O
give O
this O
guy O
airtime O
, O
but O
it’s O
a O
story O
you O
have O
to O
cover O
, O
said O
Robert B-PER
C. I-PER
Lieberman I-PER
, O
professor O
of O
political O
science O
at O
Johns B-ORG

University I-ORG
. O

The O
fact O
that O
American O
conservatives O
seem O
to O
admire O
him O
and O
think O
of O
him O
as O
someone O
to O
emulate O
really O
reveals O
the O
true O
colors O
of O
that O
wing O
of O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
and O
American O
conservative O
movement O
, O
the O
co-author O
of O
“Four O
Threats: O
The O
Recurring O
Crises O
of O
American O
Democracy” O
added O
. O

It’s O
one O
thing O
when O
Tucker B-PER
Carlson I-PER
says O
nice O
things O
about O
him O
on O
television O
or O
does O
his O
show O
from O
Budapest B-LOC
( O
last O
summer O
) O

It’s O
even O
another O
thing O
when O
CPAC B-ORG
has O
a O
meeting O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
( O
in O
May O
) O
, O
” O
Lieberman B-PER
said O
. O

But O
I O
think O
having O
Orbán B-PER
standing O
up O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
as O
a O
mouthpiece O
for O
this O
movement O
is O
taking O
that O
to O
another O
level O
of O
potential O
harm O
. O

Dresden O
says O
it’s O
a O
story O
“ O
that O
shouldn’t O
be O
ignored O
, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
a O
situation O
where O
amplifying O
Orbán B-PER
and O
his O
role O
in O
this O
in O
some O
ways O
can O
also O
have O
negative O
effects O
. O
” O

She O
cautions O
against O
sensationalism O
: O
“ O
And O
that O
extends O
beyond O
reporters O

” O

We O
know O
from O
other O
research O
in O
other O
areas O
that O
headlines O
matter O
a O
lot O
and O
imagery O
matters O
a O
lot O
… O
So O
, O
just O
being O
thoughtful O
and O
taking O
a O
second O
to O
think O
about O
coverage O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
would O
say O
. O

There O
has O
been O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
thoughtful O
pre-speech O
coverage O

In O
a O
strong O
piece O
published O
on O
August O
2 O
in O
The B-ORG

Dalibor B-PER
Rohac I-PER
asked O
if O
“ O
U.S. O

know O
what O
they O
are O
signing O
up O
for O
in O
embracing O
Hungary’s B-LOC
strongman O

The O
Washington B-ORG
Post’s I-ORG
editorial O
board O
made O
a O
powerful O
case O
in O
a O
July O
30 O
piece O
, O
saying O
Orbán’s O
racist O
comments O
should O
have O
been O
cause O
for O
CPAC B-ORG
to O
disinvite O
him O
. O

And O
CNN’s B-ORG
Fareed B-PER
Zakaria I-PER
provided O
necessary O
context O
as O
he O
explained O
on O
July O
31 O
how O
Orbán’s O
warning O
about O
“mixed O
races” O
ignored O
the O
facts O
of O
the O
country’s O
history. O

Lieberman B-PER
is O
hoping O
those O
who O
read O
and O
see O
such O
coverage O
will O
think O
about O
the O
seriousness O
and O
possible O
danger O
of O
Orbán’s B-PER
visit O
to O
CPAC B-ORG
. O

We O
used O
to O
think O
of O

as O
a O
circus O

“ O

Here O

In O
the O
days O
since O
Pelosi B-PER
left O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
China B-LOC
has O
taken O
multiple O
bellicose O
steps O
, O
both O
diplomatically O
and O
militarily O
. O

On O
the O
diplomatic O
front O
, O
Beijing B-LOC
is O
sanctioning O
Pelosi B-PER
and O
her O
immediate O

said O
Friday O
it O
would O
suspend O
cooperation O
with O
Washington B-LOC
on O
several O
issues O
, O
including O
combating O
the O
climate O

. O

The O
pause O
in O
climate O
talks O
between O
the O
US B-LOC
and O
China B-LOC
is O
symbolically O
significant O
for O
the O
two O
nations’ O
bilateral O
relationship O
because O
the O
climate O
crisis O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
areas O
the O
US B-LOC

China B-LOC
had O
continued O
to O
cooperate O
on O
in O

even O
during O

The O
US B-LOC

announced O
in O
Glasgow B-LOC
last O
year O
a O
bilateral O
agreement O
to O
cooperate O
on O
the O
climate O

, O
widely O
seen O
as O
a O
progressive O
step O
that O
would O
allow O
China B-LOC
to O
work O
on O
key O
issues O
– O
like O
reducing O
methane O

– O
without O

global O
agreements O
that O
it O

The O

been O
in O

that O
“we O
do O
not O

and O
will O
not O
provoke O

He O
called O
China’s B-LOC
recent O
actions O
“provocative” O
and O
“a O
significant O
escalation.” O

The O
speaker’s O
visit O
, O
he O
said O
, O
was O
“peaceful” O
and O
“there O
is O
no O
justification O
for O
this O
extreme O
, O
disproportionate O
and O
escalatory O
military O
response O
. O

Pelosi O
, O
a O
California B-LOC
Democrat O
, O
said O
the O
visit O
– O
the O
first O
time O
a O
US O
House B-ORG
speaker O
had O
visited O
Taiwan B-LOC
in O
25 O
years O
– O
was O
intended O
to O
make O
it O
“unequivocally O
clear” O
that O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
would O
“not O
abandon” O
Taipei B-LOC
. O

It O
came O
at O
a O
low O
point O
in O
US-China B-LOC
relations O
and O
despite O
warnings O
from O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
against O
a O
visit O
to O
the O
democratically O
governed O
island O

The O
US B-LOC
maintains O
close O
unofficial O
ties O
with O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
and O
is O
bound O
by O
law O
to O
provide O
Taiwan B-LOC
with O
defensive O
arms O
. O

But O
it O
remains O
deliberately O
vague O
on O
whether O
it O
would O
defend O
Taiwan B-LOC
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
Chinese B-LOC
invasion O
, O
a O
policy O
known O
as O
“strategic O
ambiguity O
. O

The O
US B-LOC
postponed O
a O
long O
planned O
missile O
test O
because O
of O
China’s B-LOC
angry O
reaction O
to O
Pelosi’s B-PER
trip O

A O
US O
official O
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
Defense O
Secretary O
Lloyd B-PER
Austin I-PER
directed O
the O
Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
to O
postpone O
the O
test O
flight O
of O
an O
unarmed O
Minuteman O
III O
intercontinental O
ballistic O
missile O
after O
China B-LOC
launched O
military O
exercises O

A O
top O
official O
at O
the O
Chinese B-LOC
embassy O
in O
Washington B-LOC
said O
Friday O
that O
Qin B-PER
“totally O
rejected O
the O
so-called O
condemnation” O
by O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
of O
China’s B-LOC
cross-strait O
military O
actions O
when O
he O
was O
summoned. O

The O
only O
way O
out O
of O
this O
crisis O
is O
that O
the O
US O
side O
must O
take O
matters O
immediately O
to O
rectify O
its O
mistakes O
and O
eliminate O
the O
grave O
impact O
of O
Pelosi’s O
visit O
, O
Minister O
Jing B-PER
Quan I-PER
said O
during O
a O
virtual O
briefing O
. O

Jing O
reiterated O
that O
China B-LOC
views O
Pelosi’s O
visit O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
“ O
a O
serious O
violation O
of O
the O
One O
China O
policy O
.” O

He O
said O
that O
they O
view O
the O
trip O
by O
the O
lawmaker O
as O
an O
official O
US O
government O
visit O
, O
noting O
that O
Pelosi B-PER
flew O
on O
a O
US O
government O
plane O
. O

Using O
a O
government O
plane O
is O
standard O
for O
congressional O
delegations O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
House B-ORG
speaker O
who O
is O
high O
in O
the O
line O
of O
presidential O
succession O
. O

He O
argued O
Pelosi B-PER
“knows O
where O
China’s B-LOC
red O
lines O
are” O
but O
said O
she O
“still O
chose O
to O
deliberately O
provoke O
and O
challenge O
China’s B-LOC
position.” O

Kirby O
on O
Friday O
responded O
to O
Qin O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
There’s O
nothing O
here O
for O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
to O
rectify O
– O
the O
Chinese O
can O
go O
a O
long O
way O
to O
taking O
the O
tensions O
down O
simply O
by O
stopping O
these O
provocative O
military O
exercises O
and O
ending O
the O
rhetoric O
.” O

We O
don’t O
want O
a O
crisis O

We’re O
not O
seeking O
a O
crisis O
and O
quite O
frankly O
there’s O
no O
reason O
for O
a O
crisis O
to O
erupt O
out O
of O
this O
,” O
Kirby B-PER
said O
in O
a O
response O
to O
a O
question O
from O
CNN’s B-ORG
MJ O
Lee B-PER
. O

He O
told O

the O
US B-ORG
condemns O
China’s B-LOC
sanctioning O
of O
Pelosi B-PER
and O
her O

and O

Two O
of O
Tuesday’s O
primaries O
in O
Washington B-LOC
state I-LOC
represent O
a O
key O
question O
for O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
: O
18 O
months O
removed O
from O
Donald B-PER
Trump’s I-PER
second O
impeachment O
, O
has O
the O
GOP O
anger O
at O
party O

who O

? O

Primary O
voters O
will O
answer O
that O
question O
for O
Reps O

Jaime B-PER
Herrera I-PER
Beutler I-PER
and O
Dan B-PER
Newhouse I-PER
, O
two O
of O
the O
10 O
House O
Republicans O
who O
joined O
Democrats O
to O
impeach O
Trump O
after O
the O
January O
6 O
2021 O
, O
attack O
on O
the O
US B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC
. O

In O
the O
months O
since O
their O
votes O
, O
both O
have O
paid O
the O
price O
at O
home O
. O

They O
have O
been O
criticized O
by O
their O
state O
party O
, O
censured O
by O
local O
leaders O
and O
challenged O
by O
handfuls O
of O
Republican O
challengers O
. O

But O
heading O
into O
Tuesday O
, O
Republicans O
in O
Washington B-LOC
state I-LOC
acknowledge O
that O
there O
is O
considerable O
uncertainty O
in O
both O
primaries O
, O
leading O
many O
in O
the O
state O
to O
believe O
it O
is O
possible O
– O
if O
not O
likely O
– O
that O
they O
could O
survive O
. O

If O
the O
vote O
was O
held O
a O
month O
( O
after O
the O
impeachment O
decision O
) O
, O
they O
probably O
would O
have O
lost O
, O
said O
one O
Washington B-LOC
Republican O
operative O
. O

But O
given O
9% O

, O
given O
the O
high O
gas O
prices O
we O
saw O
, O
if O
you O
are O
talking O
with O
conservative O
voters O
, O
they O
may O
be O
more O
concerned O
with O
the O
current O
situation O
in O
the O
country O
than O
they O
are O
16 O

18 O

this O

There O

either O

leaving O
many O
in O
the O
dark O
about O
what O

Adding O
to O
the O
uncertainty O
in O
both O
races O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
redistricting O
has O
shifted O
both O
districts O
slightly O
and O
Washington B-LOC
state’s I-LOC
open O
nonpartisan O
primary O
system O
that O

The O

If O
either O

it O

both O

lean O
toward O
Republicans B-ORG

Herrera B-PER
Beutler I-PER

on O

For O
many O

Cheney B-PER
represents O
their O
most O
highly O
sought-after O

to O

given O
how O
vocal O
she O

been O
in O
her O
opposition O
to O
Trump B-PER

It O
is O
a O
mess’ O
Herrera B-PER
Beutler I-PER
was O
not O
shy O
about O
her O

During O

when O

Herrera B-PER

that O
I O
voted O

be O
easier O

defeat O

he O
writes O

It O
is O
also O
possible O
that O

could O
spoil O

After O

distribute O
tens O

the O

that O
with O

we O
cannot O
get O
more O
than O
these O
paltry O
little O
dribbles O
out O

very O
frustrating O

91% O

Mandelman B-PER
feels O
he O
and O
others O
in O
the O

have O
been O
left O
to O

, O
the O

is O
a O
frustrating O
new O
chapter O
after O
the O
punishing O
Covid-19 O

At O
the O
peak O
of O
Covid O
vaccinations O
, O
we O
averaged O
1,400 O
to O
1,500 O
( O

a O

So O
we O
are O
completely O
used O
to O
the O
mass O
vaccination O
process,” O

Merjo B-PER
Roca I-PER
said. O

But O
Roca B-PER
and O
her O

are O
limited O
in O
what O
they O
can O
do O
given O
the O

shortage O

San B-LOC

health O

initially O
requested O
35,000 O

say O
they’ve O
only O
gotten O
12,000 O
from O
the O
federal O

The O
state O
of O

that O
San B-LOC

will O
receive O
10,700 O

there’s O

I O
think O
one O
of O
our O
biggest O
challenges O
is O
really O
just O
the O
inconsistency O
of O
the O

itself O
on O
being O
able O

help O

when O

So, O
it’s O
super O
hard O
for O
all O

our O

not O
to O
be O
able O

do O
that O

not O
even O

With O

of O

fearful O
about O

an O
added O
burden O
by O
not O

It’s O
very O
hard O
to O
listen O
to O
someone O
explaining O
why O
they O
want O
the O

why O
they O

just O
don’t O

they’re O
showing O
up O
more O
frequently O

bonus O
for O

immediately O

death O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
represents O
a O
significant O
moment O
for O

wobbling O

It O
may O
go O
some O
way O
to O
purge O
painful O
memories O
of O
the O
chaotic O
US O
withdrawal O
from O

year O

It O
may O
help O

be O
damning O

reviews O
of O
that O
foreign O
policy O
failure O
later O
this O

And O
more O
importantly O
, O
the O
strike O
backs O
up O
Biden’s B-PER
claim O
to O
be O
able O
to O
target O
US O
enemies O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
“ O
over O
the O
horizon O
” O
– O
part O
of O
his O
argument O
that O
America B-LOC
no O
longer O
needs O
to O
maintain O
large O
land O
armies O
on O
foreign O
battlefields O

While O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
unable O
to O
reconstitute O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
after O
the O
death O
of O
bin O
Laden B-PER
to O
its O
former O
power O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
death O
stand O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
other O
terrorist O
groups O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC

elsewhere O
. O

However O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
apparently O
killed O
in O
an O
attack O
on O
a O
house O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Kabul B-LOC
raises O
real O
concerns O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
– O
back O
under O
Taliban B-ORG
control O
– O
is O
yet O
again O
harboring O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
. O

But O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
has O
intelligence O
capabilities O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
despite O
the O
exit O
of O
US B-ORG
diplomats O

intelligence O
officials O
from O

last O
year O
. O

Biden B-PER
chose O
the O
more O
optimistic O
takeaway O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
operation O
proved O
his O
promise O
that O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
Afghanistan B-LOC
to O
again O
become O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
terrorists O

typically O
don’t O
take O
life-and-death O
decisions O

security O

massage O
their O
own O
approval O
ratings O
– O
at O
least O
most O
of O
them O
don’t O

But O
they O
all O
operate O
in O
a O
political O
context O
because O
of O
their O
position O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
Biden B-PER
could O
benefit O
incrementally O
from O
his O
commander-in-chief O
moment O
on O

, O
reporting O
from O
the O

to O

about O
the O

by O

as O
weak O

Biden’s B-PER
reputation O
as O
a O
safe O
pair O

the O

a O
botched O

that O
killed O
10 O
Afghan B-LOC
civilians O
– O
including O
seven O

. O

But O
it’s O
also O
unlikely O
that O
Monday’s O
news O
will O
do O
much O
to O
alter O
the O
fate O
of O
Democrats O
in O
November’s O
midterm O
elections O
, O
who O
fear O
heavy O
losses O
amid O
new O
signs O
the O
economy O
could O
plunge O
into O
recession O
and O
following O
months O
of O
punishing O
high O
inflation O
. O

Foreign O
policy O
victories O
can O
be O
fleeting O
, O
and O
decapitating O
terror O
groups O
no O
longer O
brings O
the O
political O
payoff O
that O
it O
did O
when O
then-President O
George B-PER
W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
was O
keeping O
score O
in O
the O
years O
after O
9/11 O
. O

It O
may O
take O
a O
few O
days O
to O
fully O
assess O
how O
Zawahiri O
was O
located O
and O
to O
confirm O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
versions O
of O
events O

On O
occasion O
, O
administrations O
have O
gotten O
details O
wrong O
or O
out O
of O
context O
in O
early O
readouts O
. O

Biden’s B-PER
assurance O
that O
no O
civilians O
were O
killed O
in O
the O
drone O
strike O
could O
not O
immediately O
be O
confirmed O

In O
an O
increasingly O
polarized O
nation O
, O
the O
killing O
could O
offer O
a O
rare O
moment O
of O
unity O
– O
even O
if O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
9/11 O
attacks O
and O
the O
relatively O
low O
profile O
of O
Zawahiri O
didn’t O
send O
crowds O
to O
chant O
outside O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
as O
was O
the O
case O
when O
bin O
Laden B-PER
was O
killed O
. O

Still, O
any O
satisfaction O
over O
the O
killing O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
is O
likely O
to O
be O
soon O
overtaken O
by O
a O
more O
multilayered O
and O
urgent O
US B-ORG
conundrum O
abroad O
– O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
standoff O
over O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
threatens O
to O
erupt O
even O
as O
the O
US B-ORG
wages O
an O
effective O
proxy O
war O
against O
Russia B-LOC
in O
Ukraine B-LOC

US O
and O
Taiwanese O
officials O
have O
said O
that O

expected O

defy O
increasingly O
irate O

While O
police O
have O
not O
provided O
details O
on O
exactly O
how O
the O
killings O
unfolded O
, O
they O
have O
said O
three O
of O

– O
Muhammad B-PER

Aftab B-PER
Hussein I-PER

– O
were O
“ O

Then O
, O
after O

marked O
a O
somber O
Friday O

two O
of O

Hussain I-PER
, O

– O
was O
found O
dead O

hours O

He O
became O
the O
third O
Muslim O
man O
killed O
in O
the O
city O
within O
two O
weeks O
and O
the O
fourth O
since O
November O

While O
police O
have O
not O
definitively O
said O
all O
four O
attacks O
are O
connected O
, O
they O
have O
said O
they O
are O
looking O
into O
whether O
that O
is O
the O
case O

With O
no O
one O

any O
possible O
motive O

whether O
any O
of O
the O
shootings O
are O
being O
investigated O
as O

crimes O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
“deeply O
troubling” O
that O
the O
victims O
were O
Muslim O
and O
of O
similar O
descent O

Kyle B-PER
Hartsock I-PER

deputy O

Police O
have O
not O
come O
out O
with O
any O
descriptions O
of O
a O
suspect O
or O
suspects O
in O
the O
killings O

They O
have O
however O
said O
they O
are O
seeking O
“ O
a O
vehicle O
of O
interest O
,” O
which O
may O
be O
connected O
to O
the O
four O
killings O
. O

The O
vehicle O
is O
a O
dark O
silver O
sedan O
that O
police O
say O
may O
be O
a O
Volkswagen B-ORG
Jetta I-ORG
. O

But O
it O
remains O
unclear O
whom O
the O
car O
belongs O
to O
, O
or O
where O
it O
was O
in O
the O
photos O
released O
by O
the O

Police O
said O
the O
vehicle O
“ O
is O
suspected O
as O
being O
used O
as O
a O
conveyance O
in O
recent O
homicides O
of O
4 O

Everyone O
believes O
that O
vehicle O
is O
very O
key O
to O
what O

in O
at O

two O
of O
the O

that O

Our O
homicide O
detectives O

our O

currently O

a O
strong O
possibility O
that O
the O

While O
we O
won’t O
go O
into O
why O
we O
think O
that O
, O
there’s O
one O
strong O
commonality O
in O
all O
of O
our O
victims O

their O
race O

religion O

We O
are O
taking O
this O
very O
serious O
and O
we O
want O
the O
public’s O
help O
in O
identifying O
this O
cowardly O

It’s O
easier O

Unequal O

said O
that O
, O
at O
the O
core, O
the O
problem O
was O
policing. O
“ O

That’s O
the O
component O
I O
don’t O

she O
said O

“ O

We’ve O

clean O
up O

Until O
we O

we’re O

Following O

New B-LOC

Democratic O

signed O
a O

Yet O
some O
observers O
have O
expressed O
concern O
that O
the O

though O
certainly O
well O

might O

Instead O

all O

on O

a O

with O
comparatively O
rigid O

, O
echoed O
some O
of O
Kaishian’s O
sentiments O
. O

What O
we’re O
seeing O
is O
an O
influx O
of O
possession O
cases O
, O
and O
these O
arrests O
are O
happening O
in O
very O
specific O
neighborhoods O
, O
mainly O
through O
stops O
of O
cars O
and O
seizures O
in O
searches O
of O
cars O
, O
” O
Mitchell B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
stressing O
that O
“ O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
situation O
is O
the O
way O
we’re O
pursuing O
gun O
laws O
that O
haven’t O
affected O
the O
supply O
of O
or O
demand O
for O
guns O
.” O

He O
also O
noted O
that O
his O
view O
puts O
him O
in O
an O
uncomfortable O
position O
, O
because O
he’s O
“not O
a O
gun O
person” O
and O
doesn’t O
own O
a O
gun O
. O

Like O
Anderson B-PER
and O
Kaishian B-PER
, O
Mitchell B-PER
pointed O
out O
the O
challenge O
that O
policing O
can O
pose O
. O

What O
we’re O
seeing O
is O
the O
police O
saying O
, O
Listen O
, O
if O
we O
can’t O
stop O
gun O
violence O
, O
then O
we O
just O
need O
to O
arrest O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
and O
hope O
that O
that O
has O
some O
type O
of O
effect O
, O
” O
Mitchell B-PER
said O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
are O
PR O
benefits O
to O
being O
able O
to O
say O
, O
We O
pulled O
14,000 O
guns O
off O
the O
street O
, O
without O
giving O
the O
denominator O
. O

There O
are O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
guns O
on O
the O
street O

Charting O
a O
path O
forward O
How O
to O
address O
gun O
violence O
without O
further O
criminalizing O
Black O
Americans O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
manufacturers O
of O
guns O
enjoy O
such O
broad O
immunity O
from O
regulation O
? O

For O
starters O
, O
we O
must O
recognize O
that O
while O
even O
well-intentioned O
gun O
control O
laws O
can O
disproportionately O
harm O
Black O
communities O
, O
there’s O
a O
flip O
side O
. O

It’s O
important O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
whenever O
you’re O
thinking O
about O
new O
criminal O
laws O
what O
the O
potential O
impact O
could O
be O
on O
different O
communities O

But O
there’s O
also O
a O
disparate O

the O

of O
the O
US’ O

Gun O
laws O
haven’t O
made O
Black O
communities O
safer O
,” O
Donalds B-PER
said O
, O
recounting O
how O
he O
was O
held O
up O
at O
gunpoint O
when O
he O
was O
a O
16-year-old O
in O
Brooklyn B-LOC
. O
“ O

There O
was O
nobody O
around O

If O
there O
were O
people O
in O
the O
vicinity O
who O
were O
armed O
, O
who O
saw O
something O
wrong O
going O
on O
, O
does O
a O
criminal O
element O
think O
twice O
about O
so O
freely O
using O
guns O
to O
cause O
violence O
or O
commit O
a O
crime O
? O

Much O
evidence O
shows O
that O
boosting O
gun O
ownership O
doesn’t O
actually O
stop O
crime O
, O
and O
that O
failing O
to O
regulate O
has O
a O
cost O
. O

Scotching O
false O
narratives O
matters O
, O
too O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Republican B-ORG
lawmakers O
often O
attempt O
to O
paint O
Democratic-controlled B-ORG
states O
as O
hellscapes O
uniquely O
afflicted O
by O
gun O
violence O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
per O
data O
from O
the O
US B-ORG
Centers I-ORG
for I-ORG
Disease I-ORG
Control I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prevention I-ORG
, O
red O
states O
have O
some O
of O
the O
highest O
firearm O
mortality O
rates O
in O
the O
country O
. O

GOP O
lawmakers’ O
deflection O
also O
ignores O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
people O
can O
export O
guns O
from O
states O
with O
looser O
gun O
control O
laws O
– O
red O
states O
, O
usually O
– O
to O
neighboring O
states O
with O
stricter O
laws O
. O

There’s O
so O
much O
myth-busting O
that O
has O
to O
happen,” O
Anderson B-PER
said. O
“ O

We’ve O
got O
to O
dismantle O
anti-Blackness O
as O
an O
operating O
code O
for O
our O
public O
policy O
.” O

Further, O
we O
can O
learn O
something O
from O
previous O
attempts O
to O
rein O
in O
gun O
violence, O
particularly O
the O
reliance O
on O
involving O
the O
criminal O
justice O
system. O

The O
1994 O
crime O
bill O
taught O
one O
unfortunate O
lesson O
, O
which O
was O
that O
there O
had O
been O
this O
intersection O
between O
regulating O
guns O
through O
unnecessarily O
long O
prison O
sentences O
that O
contributed O
to O
mass O
incarceration O
, O
” O
Ruben B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

One O
of O
the O
things O
that O
I O
think O
you O
see O
now O
is O
that O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
solutions O
getting O
advocated O
for O
that O
are O
trying O
to O
minimize O
the O
intersection O
between O
regulation O
and O
harsh O
penal O
sentences O

There’s O
even O
an O
attempt O
to O
try O
to O
come O
up O
with O
solutions O
that O
don’t O
get O
the O
criminal O
justice O
system O
involved O
at O
all O
. O

He O
said O
that O
extreme O
risk O
protection O
orders O
, O
aka O
red O
flag O
laws O
, O
which O
are O
meant O
to O
be O
civil O
, O
are O
one O
means O
toward O
this O
end O
. O

A O
worried O
family O
member O
or O
law O
enforcement O
can O
petition O
to O
have O
a O
firearm O
removed O
from O
somebody O
who O
might O
be O
a O
risk O
to O
themselves O
or O
other O
people O

If O
successful O
, O
the O
order O
is O
completely O
civil O
. O

Community O
violence O
intervention O
programs O
offer O
another O
opportunity O
to O
confront O
gun O
violence O
while O
minimizing O
interactions O
between O
high-risk O
communities O
and O
the O
criminal O
justice O
system O

These O
programs O
, O
Ruben B-PER
said O
, O
could O
make O
a O
big O
impact O
, O
and O
are O
getting O
funded O
by O
the O
new O
federal O
bill O
. O

It’s O
this O
tactical O
pivot O
from O
prior O
approaches O
to O
gun O
violence O
prevention O
that O
the O
Bipartisan B-ORG
Safer I-ORG
Communities I-ORG
Act I-ORG
in O
some O
ways O
represents O
that O
gives O
Jackson B-PER
some O
hope O

I’m O
encouraged O
because O
this O
bill O
does O
a O
really O
strong O
job O
of O
investing O
in O
programs O
to O
save O
lives O
,” O
Jackson B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
referring O
to O
how O
the O
bill O
allocates O
$750 O
million O
to O
help O

implement O

run O
crisis O
intervention O
programs O
and O
also O
closes O
the O
so-called O

other O
things O
that O
support O
Black O

Sinema B-PER
asked O
a O
question O
about O
the O
bill’s O
proposed O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
on O
corporations O
that O
gave O
them O
some O

Is O
this O
written O
in O

way O
that’s O
bad O
? O

Sinema O
asked O
, O
according O
to O
Danny B-PER
Seiden I-PER
, O
president O
of O
the O
Arizona B-ORG
Chamber I-ORG
of I-ORG
Commerce I-ORG
, O
who O
relayed O
the O
call O
to O
CNN B-ORG
. O

It O
gave O
me O
hope O
that O
she’s O
willing O
to O
open O
this O
up O
and O
maybe O
make O
it O
better O
, O
Seiden B-PER
said O
. O

Sinema’s O
office O
declined O
to O
comment O
about O
the O
call O

But O
she O
has O
expressed O
concerns O
about O
other O
tax O
provisions O
as O
well O
– O
namely O
on O
raising O
taxes O
on O
so-called O
carried O
interest O
, O
which O
would O
impact O
private O
equity O
and O
hedge O
fund O
managers O
, O
and O
raise O
$14 O
billion O
in O
the O
Democrats’ O
bill O
. O

Sinema O
has O
relayed O
to O
top O
Democrats B-ORG
that O
she O
wants O
that O
provision O
out O
of O
the O
bill O
, O
according O
to O
a O
source O
familiar O
with O
the O
matter O
. O

Sinema B-PER
, O
the O
lone O
holdout O
among O
the O
50-member O
Senate B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Caucus I-ORG
and O
who O
was O
blindsided O
by O
news O
of O
the O
deal O
last O
week O
, O
has O
refused O
to O
tip O
her O
hand O
one O
way O
or O
the O
other O
on O
the O
bill O
– O
giving O
conservative O
critics O
of O
the O
bill O
reason O
to O
believe O
they O
could O
convince O
her O
to O
change O
her O
mind O
. O

Democrats O
are O
still O
confident O
that O
they O
can O
win O
her O
over O
but O
also O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
may O
have O
to O
make O
some O
changes O
– O
particularly O
over O
the O
tax O
provisions O
– O
to O
get O
her O
to O
“yes.” O

But O
as O
she’s O
been O
in O
talks O
with O
Democrats O
who O
have O
touted O
the O
bill’s O
benefits O
, O
Republicans O
like O
Senate O
Minority O
Whip O
John B-PER
Thune I-PER
have O
expressed O
concerns O
to O
her O
about O
the O
taxes O
on O
companies O
and O
the O
proposal O
to O
hire O
new O
IRS O
agents O
to O
bolster O
tax O
enforcement O
. O

She’s O
analyzing O
it O
the O
South B-LOC
Dakota I-LOC
Republican O
said O
of O
Sinema B-PER

Keeps O
her O
own O
counsel O
, O
I O
think O
as O
most O
of O
you O
know O
, O
and O
usually O
comes O
to O
her O
own O
decisions O
, O
pretty O
independent O
of O
any O
pressure O
that O
she O
might O
get O
from O
either O
side O
. O

So O
you O
know O
, O
I O
think O
she’s O
going O
through O
that O
process O
right O
now O
. O

At O
a O
news O
conference O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
where O
Republican O
senators O
railed O
against O
the O
proposed O
tax O
hikes O
, O
Idaho B-LOC
Sen. O
Mike B-PER
Crapo I-PER
said O
senators O
were O
privately O
making O
the O
same O
case O
to O
Sinema B-PER
. O

We O
are O
making O
this O
case O
that O
we’ve O
made O
here O
to O
you O
today O
as O
aggressively O
as O
we O
can O
,” O
Crapo B-PER
said O

On O
Wednesday O
, O
Sinema B-PER
indicated O
to O
CNN B-ORG
that O
she O
was O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
announce O
her O
position O
on O
the O
bill O
. O

Taking O
my O
time,” O
she O
said. O

Her O
spokesperson O
reiterated O
that O
Sinema B-PER
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
review O
by O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian O
to O
be O
completed O
before O
announcing O
her O
position O

But O
last O
fall O
, O
Sinema B-PER
indicated O
her O
support O
for O
a O
corporate O
minimum O
tax O
, O
saying O
at O
the O
time O
that O
it’s O
a O
“common O
sense” O
proposal O
to O
ensure O
that O
“highly O
profitable O
corporations” O
pay O
their O
share O
of O
taxes O
. O

The O
proposal O
was O
developed O
last O
fall O
with O
her O
input O
after O
she O
rejected O
calls O
to O
raise O
corporate O
income O
tax O
rates O
, O
a O
Democratic B-ORG
aide O
said O
Wednesday O

In O
the O
private O
call O
with O
Sinema B-PER
on O
Tuesday O
, O
Seiden B-PER
expressed O
the O
business O
community’s O
opposition O
to O
the O
15% O
tax O
provision O
, O
noting O
it O
would O
particularly O
hit O
manufacturers O
that O
take O
advantage O
of O
an O
accelerated O
depreciation O
tax O
deduction O
that O
lowers O
their O
tax O
burden O
. O

Seiden O
said O
National B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of I-ORG
Manufacturers I-ORG
president O
Jay B-PER
Timmons I-PER
was O
also O
on O
the O
call O
; O
A O
NAM B-ORG
representative O
did O
not O
immediately O
respond O
to O
a O
request O
for O
comment O
) O

Seiden O
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
Sinema B-PER
did O
not O
“tip O
her O
hand” O
on O
any O
particular O
provision, O
asked O
for O
more O
information O
on O
how O
the O
bill O
affects O
Arizona, B-LOC
but O
asked O
that O
question, O
which O
gave O
him O
hope O
that O
she O
would O
be O
open O
to O
somehow O
amending O
the O
bill’s O
tax O
proposals. O

She O
did O
not O
tip O
her O
hand O
, O
tip O
her O
hat O
, O
in O
any O
way O
, O
shape O
or O
form O
, O
” O
Seiden B-PER
said O
. O

It O
was O
a O
pure O
listening O
moment O
for O
her O
, O
collecting O
information O
, O
soliciting O
information O
, O
just O
like O
any O
good O
representative O
would O
do O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
she O
’s O
hearing O
arguments O
from O
both O
sides O
. O

On O
the O
Senate B-LOC
floor O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
a O
number O
of O
senators O
from O
both O
parties O
approached O
the O
senator O
, O
including O
Senate O
GOP O
Leader O
Mitch B-PER
McConnell I-PER
, O
GOP O
Sen. O
Rob B-PER
Portman I-PER

Murray I-PER
of O
Washington B-LOC
state O
and O
Democratic O
Sen. O
Mark B-PER
Warner I-PER
of O
Virginia B-LOC
. O

Democratic O
leaders O
acknowledge O
they O
are O
uncertain O
where O
she O
will O
come O
down O
. O

She O
didn’t O
tell O
me O
or O
give O
me O
any O
signals O
as O
to O
where O
she’s O
going O
on O
this O
bill O
,” O
Illinois B-LOC
Sen. O
Dick B-PER
Durbin I-PER
, O
the O
Democratic O
whip O
, O
said O
of O
a O
recent O
conversation O
he O
had O
with O
the O
senator O
. O

We O
need O
her O
, O
we O
need O
every O
single O
vote O
, O
so O
I O
hope O
she’ll O
be O
with O
us O
. O

While O
Democrats B-ORG
say O
the O
bill O
would O
ensure O
large O
corporations O
don’t O
avoid O
paying O
taxes O
, O
instilling O
“fairness” O
into O
the O
tax O
code O
, O
the O
Arizona B-ORG
Chamber I-ORG
president O
argued O
that O
a O
minimum O
corporate O
tax O
makes O
the O
code O
“overly O
complicated.” O

Seiden B-PER
said O
that O
raising O
taxes O
during O
a O
recession O
is O
particularly O
unpopular O
and O
would O
inject O
more O
uncertainty O
into O
the O
marketplace O
. O

The O
meeting O
went O
great O
,” O
said O
Seiden B-PER
of O
his O
call O
with O
Sinema B-PER
. O
“ O

She O
knows O
that O
our O
businesses O
are O
struggling O
, O
because O
of O
inflation O
, O
because O
of O
supply O
chain O
issues O
. O

So O
anything O
that O
will O
impact O
or O
make O
that O
worse O
or O
halt O
the O
economic O
growth O
that O
we’ve O
seen O
, O
she’s O
very O
sensitive O
towards O
that O
. O

Seiden O
thanked O
Sinema B-PER
for O
her O
work O
on O
the O
bipartisan O
infrastructure O
bill O
and O
the O
recent O
legislation O
boosting O
semiconductor O
manufacturing O
, O
but O
said O
the O
“ O
the O
celebration O
of O
the O
Chips O
Act O
is O
short-lived O
” O
if O
some O
of O
the O
tax O
provisions O
remain O
untouched O
in O
the O

by O

Leader O
Chuck B-PER
Schumer I-PER

West B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC

Seiden B-PER
said O
he O
would O
like O
to O
see O
some O
of O
the O
energy O
and O
environmental O
pieces O
go O
through O
without O
the O
“poison O
pill” O
tax O
provisions O
, O
acknowledging O
that O
some O
elements O
of O
the O

sector O
support O
provisions O
like O
the O

for O
electric O

of I-ORG

, O
“ O
I O
am O
unwilling O

That O
was O

it O

Ayman B-PER
al-Zawahiri’s I-PER
death O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
US O
drone O
strike O
has O
raised O
questions O
about O
who O
will O
replace O
him O
as O
the O
leader O
of O
al O
Qaeda O

While O
the O
terrorist O
group O
is O
not O
short O
of O
contenders O
, O
its O
ranks O
are O
sparser O
and O
more O
geographically O
dispersed O
than O
10 O
or O
20 O
years O
ago O
. O

Here’s O
what O
we O
know O
about O
who O
could O
be O
the O
next O
Al O
Qaeda B-ORG
leader O
. O

The O
longtime O
insider O
The O
man O
tipped O
by O
many O
analysts O
to O
be O
Zawahiri’s O
successor O
is O
Saif B-PER
al-Adel I-PER
, O
a O
former O
Egyptian O
commando O
who O
is O
one O
of O
the O
last O
survivors O
of O
al O
Qaeda’s O
“founding O
generation” O
and O
has O
spent O
much O
of O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
in O
Iran B-LOC
. O

Adel O
was O
a O
loyal O
servant O
to O
Osama B-PER
bin I-PER
Laden I-PER
before O
acting O
as O
al O
Qaeda’s O
interim O
leader O
in O
2011 O

He O
organized O
the O
succession O
process O
in O
favor O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
because O
that O
was O
bin O
Laden’s B-PER
wish O
– O
even O
though O
Adel B-PER
himself O
might O
have O
been O
a O
more O
effective O
choice O
as O
competition O
from O
ISIS B-ORG
grew O
in O
the O
following O
years O

Saif B-PER
al-Adel I-PER
is O
his O
nom O
de O
guerre O
, O
which O
translates O
as O
Sword O
of O
Justice O
. O

It’s O
not O
the O
only O
mystery O
about O
the O
man O
. O

There O
are O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
purported O
photographs O
of O
him O
in O
existence O

He O
is O
said O
to O
have O
faked O
his O
death O
in O
his O
20s O

His O
status O
in O
Iran B-LOC
has O
also O
been O
unclear O
: O
sometimes O
detained O
, O
sometimes O
under O
house O
arrest O

sometimes O

describes O
Adel B-PER
as O
the O
ultimate O
insider, O
someone O
well-connected O
across O
many O

and O
a O

For O

When O

he O

with O

” O
Soufan B-PER
added O

Above O
all O
, O
he O
is O
a O

– O
a O

who O
would O
have O
known O
that O
despite O
the O

his O
best O
chance O
of O

and O
therefore O
of O
continued O
effectiveness O
in O
the O

, O
lay O
in O
a O
return O
to O
Iran B-LOC

Soufan O
also O
notes O
that O
al-Adel O
was O
a O
mentor O
to O
the O
leader O
of O
al O

in O
Iraq B-LOC
Abu O
Musab O
al-Zarqawi O
, O
whose O
organization O
later O
morphed O
into O
ISIS B-ORG

Saif O
as O

would O
enjoy O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
to O
attract O
some O
former O

back O

A O
UN B-ORG

that O

in O

were O
from O

It O
mentioned O
three O

he O

he O
“ O

as O
did O

It O
has O
been O
prone O
to O
internal O
rifts O
and O
its O
fortunes O
have O
swung O
wildly O
but O
it O
has O
survived O
a O
challenge O
from O
the O
budding O
ISIS B-ORG

Diriye B-PER
has O
been O
its O
leader O
since O
2014 O
, O
a O
tenure O
of O
unlikely O
longevity O
. O

Shabaab O
and O
al O

have O
been O
united O
for O
a O
decade O
and O
Diriye B-PER
was O
quick O
to O
pledge O
allegiance O
to O
Zawahiri B-PER
when O
he O
became O
leader O

For O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
, O
the O
appointment O
of O
a O
leader O
from O
Africa B-LOC
would O
be O
a O
cultural O
leap O
. O

Some O
former O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
insiders O
say O
that O
senior O
Egyptian B-LOC
and O
Saudi B-LOC
figures O
within O
the O
organization O
often O
looked O
down O
on O
African B-LOC
affiliates O

Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
has O
only O
ever O
had O
two O
leaders O
and O
the O
current O
status O
of O
its O
governing O
Shura O
( O
council O
) O
, O
which O
had O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
election O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
, O
is O
hard O
to O
discern O
. O

When O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
selected O
, O
he O
had O
already O
been O
anointed O
by O
bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
as O
his O
successor O
but O
it O
still O
took O
some O
time O
to O
garner O
the O
“bayat” O
– O
the O
oath O
of O
loyalty O
– O
of O
far-flung O
members O
of O
the O
council O
. O

The O
working O
assumption O
among O
analysts O
is O
that O
members O
of O
the O
Shura B-ORG
may O
over O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
begin O
to O
declare O
bayat O
to O
al B-ORG
Qaeda’s I-ORG
third O
leader O

But O
the O
field O
of O
possible O
contenders O
has O
been O
whittled O
down O
over O
the O
years O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
deaths O
of O
bin O
Laden’s B-PER
son O
Hamza B-PER
and O
the O
murder O
in O
Iran B-LOC
of O
another O
prominent O
al O

figure O
, O
Mohammed B-PER
al O
Masri I-PER
. O

The O
leadership O
of O
al O

in O
the O
Arabian O
Peninsula O
, O
based O
in O
Yemen B-LOC
, O
has O
also O
been O
decimated O
by O
US O
and O
Saudi B-ORG
operations O
. O

Can O
Al B-ORG

reinvent O
itself O
? O

However O
, O
there O
may O
be O
opportunities O
for O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
to O
reinvent O
itself O
– O
whether O
Adel B-PER
becomes O
the O
next O
leader O
or O
al O

turns O
to O
the O
next O
generation O
of O
battle-hardened O
African B-LOC
jihadis O
. O

The O
UN B-ORG
panel O
of O
experts O
on O

believes O
“ O
the O

favourable O

which O
intends O

as O
the O
key O

in O

” O
the O
UN B-ORG

concluded O
. O

Within O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
al O

predominant O
presence O
has O
been O
in O
the O
south O
and O
east O
, O
though O
the O
UN B-ORG

noted O
that O
it O
may O
be O
seeking O
to O
establish O
a O
presence O
in O
western O
provinces O
bordering O

Al B-ORG

is O
not O
without O

beyond O
its O
long O
historical O

in O
Central B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
such O
as O
the O
Turkestan B-ORG

also O
retain O
a O
presence O
. O

It O
seems O
likely O
that O
whoever O
succeeds O
Zawahiri B-PER
, O
the O
group’s O
leadership O
will O
continue O
to O
have O
its O
center O
of O
gravity O
in O

long O
as O

even O
if O
its O
many O
of O

take O

The O
successor’s O
task O

be O
to O

harnessing O

Georgia B-LOC
House O
Bill O

dubbed O
the O

Act” O
– O
was O
signed O
into O
law O
by O
Republican O
Gov. O
Brian B-PER
Kemp I-PER
in O
2019 O

It O
banned O
the O

at O
six O
weeks O
, O
before O
many O
women O
know O
they’re O
pregnant O
. O

A O
federal O
judge O
then O
ruled O
it O
unconstitutional O
and O
blocked O
it O

However O
, O
after O
Roe B-PER
v. I-PER
Wade I-PER
was O
overturned O
, O
the O
federal O
appeals O
court O
allowed O
it O
to O
take O

Under O
the O

, O

with O
“full O

and O
“shall O

After O
the O
ruling O
, O
the O
definition O
of O

Georgia B-LOC
was O
amended O
to O
include O
an O

of O
the O

Taxpayers O
will O
have O
to O
be O
prepared O

provide O
“relevant O

other O
supporting O
documentation” O
to O
support O
the O
dependent O
deduction O
claimed O
, O
the O
department O
said O

It O
did O
not O
specify O
what O
those O

would O
be O

It’s O
unclear O
how O
the O

A O
federal O
judge O
recently O
blocked O
a O

provision O
in O
an O

in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
forbidding O
the O

Clark B-PER

a O
factor O
that O

added O
more O

the O
“ O

indeed O

Balint B-PER

High O

Balint B-PER

Balint B-PER
, O
at O

this O

it O

“ O

Molly B-PER

During O

, O
Gray B-PER
jabbed O
Balint B-PER
over O
“ O

said O
that O

backed O
off O

“ O

an O

also O

private O

But O
the O
origins O

remain O
largely O
secretive O

Retailers O
aren’t O
typically O
forthcoming O
about O
the O
companies O
that O
make O
their O

And O
manufacturers O
, O
likewise O
, O
have O
little O
incentive O

reveal O
that O
they’re O
creating O
similar O
products O
to O
their O

under O
a O

on O

Many O
leading O
national O
brand O
manufacturers O
create O
private O
labels O
for O
multiple O
retailers O

In O
the O
late O
1990s O
more O
than O
half O
of O
brand O
manufacturers O
were O
estimated O
to O
make O
private O
goods O
as O
well O

Although O
store O
brands O
ostensibly O
compete O
with O
manufacturers’ O
national O
brands O
, O
manufacturers O
often O
have O
excess O
capacity O
on O
their O
production O
lines O
. O

To O
generate O
additional O
profit O
, O
some O
will O
use O
that O
extra O
capacity O
to O
make O
private O

. O

Other O
brand O
manufacturers O
will O
produce O
private O
labels O
as O
an O
incentive O
for O
retailers O
, O
hoping O
they’ll O
be O
rewarded O
with O
better O
shelf O

placement O
for O
their O
own O

Manufacturers O
don’t O
want O
it O

because O
it O
undermines O
the O
power O
of O
their O

These O
private O

were O
the O
exception O

however O
. O

For O
most O
of O

national O
brands O

These O

flooded O

extolling O
the O
advantages O
of O
their O
products O

Most O
customers O
were O
fiercely O
loyal O
to O
specific O
brands O
, O
not O
retailers O
. O

A O
store O
that O
didn’t O
carry O
major O
labels O
would O
likely O
get O
crushed O
, O
which O
gave O
manufacturers O
immense O
leverage O
. O

Additionally O
, O
many O
store O
brands O
were O
also O
considered O
dull O
, O
cheap O
knockoffs O
of O
national O
brands O
. O

The O
low O
point O
of O
private O
label O
came O
during O
the O
1970s O
, O
Durham B-PER
said O
, O
when O
stores O
seeking O
to O
cut O
costs O
and O
rolled O
out O
generics O
with O
basic O
white O
backgrounds O
and O
black O
letters O
identifying O
the O
product O
– O
beer O

, O

Retailers O
make O
private O
label O
brands O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
, O
including O
to O
boost O
profitability O
and O
sometimes O
as O
a O
negotiating O
tool O
against O
brands O
. O

Private O
brands O
often O
carry O
profit O
margins O
that O
are O
20% O
to O
40% O
higher O
than O
national O
brands O
because O
stores O
don’t O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
advertising O
, O
distribution O
or O
other O
markup O
costs O
that O
are O
embedded O
in O
major O
brands’ O
prices O
. O

In O
the O
mid-20th O
century O
, O
many O
retailers O
started O
to O
develop O
their O
own O
labels O
to O
claw O
back O
bargaining O
power O
from O
dominant O
suppliers O
and O
keep O
their O
prices O
in O
check O
. O

As O
the O
US B-LOC
retail O
industry O
has O
consolidated O
in O
recent O
decades O
, O
the O
power O
dynamic O
between O
retailers O
and O
suppliers O
reversed O
. O

Now O
, O
stores O
have O
more O
leverage O
to O
introduce O
their O
own O
labels O
– O
whether O
name O
brands O
like O
it O

not O

Forty O

Here’s O
the O
deal: O
Cracker B-ORG

added O
Impossible O

Perhaps O
because O
they O
realized O

20 O

that O

The O
Uvalde B-LOC

recommended O

the O
position O

The O
school O

has O
postponed O
Arredondo’s O
termination O
hearing O
twice O

of O
requests O
from O
his O
attorney O
involving O
his O

Most O
recently O
, O
the O

saying O
that O
even O
though O
some O
of O
the O
security O
measures O
are O
reassuring O
, O
his O
son O
said O
that O
an O
increased O
number O
of O
officers O
doesn’t O
make O
him O
feel O
safer O
because O
he O
believes O
officers O
didn’t O
help O
during O
the O
massacre O
. O

As O
of O
right O
now O
, O
we O
’ll O
just O
continue O
virtual O
and O
see O
if O
somehow O
we O
can O
change O
the O
perception O
of O
the O
school O
officers O
or O
the O
police O
officers O
in O
general O
because O
right O
now O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
the O

don’t O
have O
any O
confidence O

there O
I O
met O
a O

really O
is O

And O
when O
I O
talk O
about O
that O
, O
it O
was O
an O
experience O
that O
I O
had O
because O
she O
was O
able O

give O
me O
a O

” O
Abrams B-PER

when O

And O
over O
the O
course O

I O
really O

about O

… O

And O
that O
, O
for O
me O
as O

means O
that O
I O

Brian B-PER
Kemp I-PER
, O
who O
narrowly O
defeated O
her O
in O
2018 O
. O

Abortion O
rights O
has O
become O
a O
key O
issue O
in O
Georgia B-LOC
this O
time O
after O
the O
US O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
overturned O
Roe O

June O
, O
a O
decision O
that O
helped O
clear O
the O
way O
for O
a O
restrictive O
abortion O
ban O
in O
the O
state O
to O
take O
effect O

The O
ban O
, O
signed O
by O
Kemp B-PER
2019 O
, O
prohibits O
abortions O
when O
a O
fetal O
heartbeat O
can O
be O
detected O

which O
can O
be O
as O
early O

six O

when O
many O

yet O
know O
they’re O
pregnant O

The O
law O
was O
later O
blocked O
by O
a O
federal O
district O

as O
unconstitutional O

However O
, O
after O
Roe O
was O
overturned O
, O
a O
federal O
appeals O

allowed O
it O
to O
take O
effect O

how O
she O

such O

be O
the O
first O

seven O

she O
said O

I O
understand O
how O
to O
negotiate O

how O
to O
navigate O

what O
I O
also O
understand O
is O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
Georgians B-LOC
do O
not O
like O
this O
law O
– O
it O
is O
an O
extreme O
ban O

it O
is O
dangerous O

it O
affects O

“ O

Bryan O
was O
not O
armed O
while O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
were O
. O

To O
give O
you O
a O
life O
sentence O
would O
be O
to O
not O
distinguish O
you O
at O
all O
from O
the O
McMichaels B-ORG
,” O
she O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
Bryan B-PER
still O
deserved O
a O
long O
sentence O
. O

She O
noted O
he O
would O
be O
90 O
when O
his O
federal O
sentence O
ends O

The O
sentencing O
of O
both O
McMichaels O
were O
preceded O
by O
emotional O
testimony O
from O
Arbery’s O
family O
, O
which O
told O
the O
court O
about O
how O
his O
killing O
had O
impacted O
them O
and O
changed O
their O
family O
. O

They O
also O
condemned O
the O
actions O
of O
both O
men O
, O
with O
Cooper-Jones B-PER
testifying O
to O
her O
confusion O
when O
she O
learned O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
was O
with O
Travis B-PER
he O
killed O
Arbery B-PER
. O

At O
first O
, O
she O
said O
, O
she O
questioned O
whether O
that O
could O
be O
true O
. O

I O
struggled O
to O
come O
to O
the O
realization O
that O
a O
father O
would O
actually O
accompany O
his O
son O
to O
take O
a O
life O
” O
she O
said O
.” O

I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
believe O
that O
, O
because O
me O
as O
a O
mother O
, O
I O
could O
never O
accompany O
my O
son O
to O
do O
any O
type O
of O
crime O
. O

Before O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
was O
sentenced O
, O
he O
acknowledged O
Arbery’s O
family O
, O
who O
were O
in O
court O
, O
saying O
the O
“loss O
that O
you’ve O
endured O
is O
beyond O
description O
. O

There’s O
no O
words O
for O
it O
. O

I’m O
sure O
that O
my O
words O
mean O
little O
to O
you O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
assure O
you O
I O
never O
wanted O
any O
of O
this O
to O
happen O
. O

There O
was O
no O
malice O
in O
my O
heart O
or O
my O
son’s O
heart O
that O
day O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
also O
apologized O
to O
his O
wife O
and O
his O
son O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
I O
should O
have O
never O
put O
him O
in O
that O
situation O
.” O

Finally, O
I O
pray O
that O
God’s O
peace O
will O
come O
to O
the O
Arbery B-PER
family O
and O
this O
community,” O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
said. O

Cooper-Jones B-PER
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Sara B-PER
Sidner I-PER
that O
while O
she O
accepted O
the O
apology O
, O
“ O
I O
did O
not O
forgive O
him O
for O
what O
he O
did O
. O
” O

She O
said O
she O
thought O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
to O
think O
about O
while O
he’s O
been O
in O
jail O
for O
the O
past O
two-plus O
years O
. O

He’s O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
he O
made O
a O
very O
bad O
decision O
, O
and O
he O
wanted O
to O
say O
he O
was O
sorry O
, O
” O
she O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O

So O
I O
did O
accept O
it O
, O
but O
as O
far O
as O
forgiving O
, O
I O
haven’t O
forgave O
him O
. O

Bryan O
later O
issued O
a O
similar O
apology O
, O
but O
Arbery’s O
father O
, O
Marcus B-PER
Arbery I-PER
Sr. O
, O

dismissed O
Bryan B-PER
’s O
words O
. O

When O
this O
first O
happened O
, O
he O
should O
have O
shown O
some O
kind O
of O
remorse O
then O
, O
” O
Arbery B-PER
said O
. O

When O
you O
get O
caught O
up O
and O
it’s O
looking O
bad O
for O
you O
, O
that’s O
when O
you’re O
trying O
to O
apologize O
. O

That’s O
a O
bad O
time O
to O
apologize O

He O
should O
have O
did O
that O
day O
one O
. O

Attorney O
Ben B-PER
Crump I-PER
, O
who O
represents O
the O
Arbery O
family O
, O
said O
he O
hopes O
it O
is O
a O
“turning O
point O
in O
the O
civil O
rights O
movement O
.” O

This O
sentence O
sends O
a O
message O
that O
vigilantes O
cannot O
hunt O
down O
and O
kill O
an O
innocent O
Black O
man O
, O
putting O
themselves O
in O
the O
roles O
of O
police O
, O
judge O
and O
executioner O
, O
without O
paying O
a O
high O
price O
, O
” O
he O
said O
in O
a O
statement O
. O

Judge O
denies O
McMichaels’ O
requests O
to O
remain O
in O
federal O
custody O
Arbery’s O
killing O
, O
months O
before O
the O
police O
killing O
of O
George B-PER
Floyd I-PER
in O
Minneapolis B-LOC
, O
was O
in O
some O
ways O
a O
harbinger O
of O
the O
nationwide O
protests O
that O
erupted O
that O
summer O
as O
demonstrators O
decried O
how O
people O
of O

sometimes O
are O
treated O
by O

Travis B-PER
McMichael I-PER

attorney O
Amy B-PER

argued O
Monday O
for O
her O

to O

to O
serve O
out O
his O
prison O
term O

Travis B-PER
McMichael I-PER
fears O
for O
his O
life O
in O
a O
state O
prison O
, O
Copeland B-PER
said O
, O
telling O
the O
court O
his O
client O
had O
received O
“ O
hundreds O
” O
of O
threats O
. O

Forcing O
him O
to O
serve O
the O
time O
in O
a O
Georgia B-LOC
state O
prison O
would O
essentially O
amount O
to O
a O
“backdoor O
death O
penalty” O
that O
could O
leave O
McMichael B-PER
vulnerable O
to O
“vigilante O
justice,” O
she O
argued, O
acknowledging O
the O
“rich O
irony.” O

Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
’s O
attorney O
made O
a O
similar O
request O
, O
but O
argued O
the O
66 O
-year-old O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
federal O
custody O
for O
his O
health O
. O

Prosecutors O
opposed O
both O
requests O

In O
cases O
in O
which O
a O
defendant O
faces O
charges O
in O
separate O
jurisdictions O
, O
they O
argued O
, O
the O
one O
that O
issues O
its O
sentence O
first O
takes O
precedence O
. O

The O
judge O
agreed O
and O
denied O
the O
requests O
, O
telling O
Travis B-PER
McMichael I-PER
she O
had O
“ O
neither O
the O
authority O
nor O
the O
inclination O
” O
to O
override O
the O
rules O
. O

To O
make O
their O
case O
, O
federal O
prosecutors O
focused O
on O
how O
each O
defendant O
had O
spoken O
about O
Black O
people O
in O
public O
and O
in O
private O
, O
using O
inflammatory O
, O
derogatory O
and O
racist O
language O
. O

Prosecutors O
and O
Arbery’s B-PER
family O
had O
said O
he O
was O
out O
for O
a O

the O

on O

when O
the O
defendants O
chased O
and O
killed O
him O
in O
their O
neighborhood O
outside O
Brunswick B-LOC
, O
Georgia B-LOC

Defense O
attorneys O
argued O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
pursued O
Arbery B-PER
in O
a O
pickup O
through O
neighborhood O
streets O
to O
stop O
him O
for O
police O
, O
believing O
he O
matched O
the O
description O
of O
someone O
captured O
in O
footage O
recorded O
at O
a O
home O
under O
construction O
. O

Prosecutors O
acknowledged O
Arbery B-PER
had O
entered O
the O
home O
in O
the O
past O
, O
but O
he O
never O
took O
anything O
. O

The O
defense O
also O
argued O
Travis B-PER
McMichael I-PER
shot O
Arbery B-PER
in O
self-defense O
as O
they O
wrestled O
over O
McMichael’s O
shotgun O
. O

Bryan B-PER

own O
truck O
after O
seeing O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
follow O
Arbery B-PER
in O
their O
pickup O

he O
ran O

Two O
prosecutors O
initially O
instructed O

Though O
Graham B-PER

the O
benefits O

the O

Act O

Democrats’ O
sweeping O

health O

bill O
that O
is O
being O
debated O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
on O
Sunday O
, O
the O
senators O
both O
advocated O
more O
bipartisan O
gun O
legislation O
. O

The O
two O
senators O
, O
who O
both O
supported O
the O
gun O
safety O
legislation O
passed O
earlier O
this O
year O
, O
said O
there O
were O
more O
gun O

overhauls O
they O
both O
want O
to O
see O
passed O

They O
specifically O
highlighted O
a O
proposal O
to O
empower O
judges O
and O
law O
enforcement O
to O
restrict O
gun O
access O
to O
those O
who O
may O
pose O
a O
threat O
to O
others O

I O
think O
what O
we O
can O
do O
is O
incentivize O
states O
to O
give O
them O
the O
tools O
they O
need O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
before O
it’s O
too O
late O
Graham B-PER
said O
, O
stressing O
that O
his O
proposal O
would O
not O
be O
a O
national O
‘red O

law O
. O

The O
common O
ground O
that O
I O
think O
we O
share O
and O
many O
of O
my O
colleagues O
on O
both O
sides O
of O

share O
: O
Keep O

Blumenthal B-PER

The O

by O
their O

positions O
when O
asked O
about O
Democrats’ B-ORG
climate O

bill O

Blumenthal B-PER
said O
the O
bill O
would O
deliver O
“historic” O
cost O

to O
Americans O
, O
while O
Graham B-PER
said O
the O
legislation O
is O
“gonna O
make O
everything O
worse.” O

Blumenthal B-PER
and O
Graham B-PER
also O
split O
on O
whether O
Congress B-ORG
should O
codify O
the O
right O
to O
marriage O
for O
same-sex O

Though O
some O
Republicans O
have O
said O
they O
would O
side O

on O
the O

Graham B-PER
said O
he O
believes O
same-sex O

When O

Blumenthal B-PER

whether O

not O
he O

saying O
instead O
that O
he O

I’m O
going O

very O

honest O
with O

My O

Blumenthal B-PER

He O
continued O
: O
“ O
I O

support O

decides O

” O

Graham O
, O
in O
contrast O
, O
reiterated O
his O
support O
for O
Donald B-PER

said O
he O
would O
support O
the O

he O
runs O

a O
second O

in O
2024 O

However O
, O
Graham B-PER
said O
Trump B-PER
should O
refrain O
from O
bringing O
up O
election O
conspiracies O
if O
he O
runs O
again O
, O
noting O
: O
“ O
I O
don’t O
believe O
the O

stolen O

” O

But O
he O
added O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
“look O
at O

I O
think O
we O
should O
look O
at O
election O
integrity O

to O
make O
sure O
some O
problems O
don’t O
happen O
again O

But O
if O
he O
runs O
for O

, O
talking O
about O

is O
not O
what O
people O
want O

A O

The O

in O
June B-LOC
for O

But O

: O
capacity O
at O
the O
four O

down O
about O
13% O
from O
three O
years O

That O
combination O
of O
very O
strong O
demand O
and O
limited O

sent O
fares O
soaring O

Soaring O

, O
canceled O

The O
amount O
passengers O

each O

the O

was O
up O
19.3% O
in O
the O

2019 O

Another O

that O

22% O

But O
those O

tell O
the O
whole O
story O

Business O

returned O
to O

Those O
tickets O

cost O
much O
more O

Unlike O
previous O
years O

when O

could O
avoid O
some O
fare O

for O

by O
jacking O
up O

international O
passengers O
, O
this O

the O

last O

The O

announced O
new O

require O

there’s O
little O
Buttigieg B-PER
can O
do O
about O
the O
fares O
themselves O

Mergers O
mean O
fewer O

blame O
the O

experts O
say O
the O
loss O

if O

HHS O
waited O
more O
than O
three O
weeks O
after O
the O
first O
confirmed O
case O
of O
monkeypox O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
to O
order O
bulk O
stocks O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
, O
which O
the O
government O
owns O
and O
stores O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
, O
be O
bottled O
and O
sent O
to O
the O
US B-LOC
for O
distribution O
. O

The O
delay O
was O
in O
part O
out O
of O
concern O
that O
once O
those O
vaccines O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
bulk O
storage O
, O
they O
would O
lose O
years O
of O
shelf O
life O
. O

Monkeypox O
can O
infect O
anyone O
, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
cases O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
outbreak O
have O
been O
among O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
, O
including O
gay O
and O
bisexual O
men O
and O
people O
who O
identify O
as O
transgender O
. O

Close O
contact O
with O
an O
infected O
individual O
is O
required O
for O
the O
spread O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
virus O
, O
experts O
say O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
initially O
announced O
vaccines O
for O
monkeypox O
were O
being O
released O
from O
the O
Strategic B-ORG
National I-ORG
Stockpile I-ORG
and O
offered O
to O
the O
“high-risk” O
contacts O
of O
monkeypox O
patients O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
health O
care O
workers O
treating O
them O
. O

Federal O
health O
officials O
have O
since O
expanded O
vaccination O
efforts O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
broader O
community O
of O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
, O
the O
demographic O
that O
makes O
up O
most O
US B-LOC
monkeypox O
cases O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
providing O
vaccines O
, O
the O
CDC B-ORG
has O
said O
since O
June O
it O
has O
made O
a O
concerted O
effort O
to O
do O
extensive O
education O
and O
outreach O
to O
the O
LGBTQ O
community O
. O

Possible O
change O
to O
how O
vaccine O
is O
administered O
Health O
officials O
are O
considering O
changing O
the O
way O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
doses O
are O
administered O
because O
the O
country O
is O
“ O
at O
a O
critical O
inflection O
point O
” O

Administration I-ORG
Commissioner O
Dr. O
Robert B-PER
Califf I-PER
told O
reporters O
on O
Thursday O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
, O
it’s O
become O
clear O
to O
all O
of O
us O
that O
given O
the O
continued O
spread O
of O
the O
virus O
, O
we’re O
at O
a O
critical O
inflection O
point O
, O
dictating O
the O
need O
for O
additional O
solutions O
to O
address O
the O
rise O
in O
infection O
rates O
, O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O

The O
goal O
has O
always O
been O
to O
vaccinate O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
commissioner O
said O
officials O
are O
considering O
allowing O
health O
care O
providers O
to O
be O
able O
to O
use O
a O
dose-sharing O
method O
where O
one O
vial O
of O
Jynneos B-ORG
vaccine O
– O
previously O
used O
as O
one O
dose O
– O
will O
be O
used O
to O
administer O
up O
to O
five O
separate O
doses O

This O
approach O
would O
change O
the O
way O
Jynneos B-ORG
is O
administered O
, O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
vaccine O
being O
administered O
in O
the O
fat O
layer O
under O
the O
skin O
, O
it O
will O
be O
delivered O
underneath O
the O
skin O
layer O
. O

There O
are O
some O
advantages O
to O
intradermal O
administration O
including O
an O
improved O
immune O
response O
to O
the O
vaccine O
,” O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O

It’s O
important O
to O
note O
that O
overall O
safety O
and O
efficacy O
profile O
will O
not O
be O
sacrificed O
for O
this O
approach O

Please O
know O
, O
we’ve O
been O
exploring O
all O
scientifically O
feasible O
options O
and O
we O
believe O
this O
could O
be O

she O
remained O
largely O
unknown O
to O
US B-LOC

Then O
came O
“Grease,” O
which O
was O
1978’s O
top-grossing O
movie O
and O
became O
an O
enduring O
cultural O
phenomenon. O

The O
movie O
gave O
Newton-John B-PER
an O
opportunity O
to O
change O
her O
squeaky-clean O
image O

The O
cover O
of O
her O
next O

featured O
the O

In O
1981 O

She O
also O
appeared O
in O

she O
teamed O
with O
Travolta B-PER
again O
for O

“ O

I O
had O
‘Xanadu’ O

that O
haunted O
the O

It’s O
very O
hard O
to O
live O
with O
that O
,” O
she O
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Larry B-PER
King I-PER
in O
2006 O
. O

It’s O
probably O
the O
hardest O
thing O
I’ve O
ever O
experienced O
, O
and O
I’ve O
been O
through O
a O

Although O
her O

Newton-John B-PER
never O

it’s O
all O
I O

That’s O
all O
I O

Mark B-PER
Bankston I-PER
, O
the O

on O
Thursday O
requested O
at O
the O

that O
Bankston O
delete O
the O

Judge O
Maya B-PER
Guerra I-PER
Gamble I-PER
, O
who O

suggested O
to O
Reynal O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
whether O
his O
motion O
for O
a O

She O
noted O
he O
has O
repeatedly O
moved O
for O
a O

during O
various O
court O
proceedings O

been O
denied O
each O
time O

After O
Reynal B-PER
indicated O
he O
was O
serious O
in O
asking O
for O
a O
mistrial O
, O
Gamble B-PER
denied O
the O
request O
. O

Reynal O
also O
asked O
for O
10 O
days O
to O
review O
the O

so O
that O
he O
could O
move O
to O
prevent O
the O

Gamble B-PER
denied O
his O
request O
to O
receive O
10 O
days O
, O
but O
did O
give O
him O
some O
time O
to O
him O
to O
review O
the O
material O
and O
research O
whether O
any O

I O
think O
you O
should O
try O
to O
work O
on O
it O
today O

see O
what O
you O
can O
get O
done O
Gamble B-PER

Dry O

has O
ignited O
some O
of O
the O
most O
destructive O
and O
costly O
wildfires O
in O
California B-LOC
history O
, O
a O
new O
study O
shows O

Researchers O
found O
that O
over O
the O
past O
few O
decades O
, O
nearly O
half O
of O
the O
lightning O
strikes O
that O
hit O
the O
ground O
during O
spring O
and O
summer O
had O
been O
dry O
— O
there O
was O
no O
rain O
falling O
nearby O
. O

Dry O
lightning O
tends O
to O
happen O
in O
storms O
over O
areas O

extreme O
drought O
, O
like O
the O
one O
California B-LOC
has O
been O
in O
for O
the O
past O
several O
years O
. O

The O
air O
is O
so O
dry O
that O
the O
rain O
evaporates O
before O
it O
hits O
the O
ground O

And O
the O
conditions O
that O
favor O

particularly O
the O
August B-LOC

, O
the O
largest O
wildfire O
in O
the O

history O
— O
as O
the O
motivation O
for O
the O
research O
. O

The O
August O
Complex O
Fire O
was O
originally O
more O
than O
three O
dozen O
fires O
that O
were O
sparked O
by O
dry O
lightning O

Those O
fires O
merged O
to O
become O
the O
largest O
in O
state O
history O
, O
burning O
more O
than O
a O
million O
acres O
in O
seven O
counties O
. O

California B-LOC
firefighters O
were O
exhausted O
that O
summer O
, O
CNN B-ORG
reported O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
they O
were O
particularly O
concerned O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
more O
and O
more O
fires O
sparked O
by O
dry O
lightning O

All O
of O
the O
seven O
largest O
fires O
in O
California B-LOC
history O
have O
occurred O
in O
the O
past O
five O
years O
, O
and O
four O
of O
those O
were O
caused O
by O
lightning O
, O
according O
to O
data O
from O
Cal B-ORG
Fire I-ORG
. O

With O
warming O
and O
drying O
and O
drier O
vegetation O
, O
it O
doesn’t O
take O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
lightning O
to O
start O
wildfires O
, O
” O
Kalashnikov B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O

So O
even O
if O
, O
on O
the O
off O
chance O
, O
dry O
lightning O
decreases O
in O
the O
future O
, O
it O
just O
takes O
one O
outbreak O
one O
day O
in O
a O
year O
to O
cause O
a O
lot O
of O
fire O
and O
a O
lot O
of O

if O
that O
were O
to O
happen O

The O
study O

funded O
by O
NASA B-ORG

published O
Monday O
in O
the O

Climate I-ORG
, O
is O
the O
first O
to O
develop O
long-term O
climatology O
of O
dry O

in O
California B-LOC
, O
specifically O
focusing O
on O
Central B-LOC
and O
Northern B-LOC
California I-LOC
, O
an O
area O
where O
lightning O
is O
a O
significant O
cause O
of O
wildfire O
. O

Dry O
lightning O
was O
found O
to O
occur O
most O
frequently O
in O
July B-LOC
and O
August B-LOC
, O
the O
researchers O
found O
, O
though O
lower O
elevation O
regions O
tended O
to O
see O
activity O
peak O
later O
in O
September B-LOC
and O
October B-LOC
, O
when O
vegetation O
is O
even O
drier O
. O

Researchers O
found O
that O
around O
Sacramento B-LOC

San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
, O
Redwood B-LOC
, O
Sequoia B-LOC
and O
Yosemite B-LOC
, O
lightning O
sparked O
nearly O
30% O
, O
of O
fires O
which O
accounted O
for O
nearly O
50% O
of O
the O
total O
burned O
area O
. O

That O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fires O
started O
by O
lightning O
, O
which O
are O
usually O
more O
difficult O
to O
attack O
because O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
remote O
than O
human O
caused O
fires O
” O
Chris B-PER
Vagasky I-PER
, O
a O
meteorologist O
and O

applications O
manager O
at O
Vaisala B-ORG
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

Vagasky B-PER
, O
who O
is O
not O
involved O
with O
the O
study O
, O
said O
the O
findings O
provide O
“ O
excellent O
background O
” O
for O
weather O
forecasting O
and O
wildland O
management O
communities O
to O
better O
determine O
the O
conditions O
that O
are O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
occur O
in O
advance O
. O

This O
really O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O
understanding O
when O
dry O
lightning O
can O
be O
expected O
so O
that O
crews O
can O
be O
at O
the O
ready O
in O
the O
event O
of O
fire O
starting O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

So O
it’s O
good O
to O
see O
that O
there O
is O
now O
a O
study O
for O
this O
region O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
that O
shows O
not O
just O
the O
time O
of O
year O
, O
but O
the O
type O
of O
meteorological O
conditions O
that O
appear O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
. O

The O
research O
is O
just O
the O
first O
step O
, O
Vagasky B-PER
said O
. O

When O
thunderstorms O
do O
develop O
, O
first O
responders O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
dry O
lightning O
conditions O
may O
be O
possible O
, O
but O
they O
will O
also O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
quickly O
respond O
to O
areas O
that O
are O
impacted O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

Kalashnikov B-PER
said O
there O
are O
still O
uncertainties O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
lightning O
research O
, O
whether O
dry O
lightning O
will O
occur O
more O
often O
as O
the O
climate O
changes O
. O

But O
one O
thing O
is O
certain O
, O
he O
said O
, O
as O
the O
Western B-LOC
drought O
persists O
, O
conditions O
are O
much O
more O
favorable O
for O
dry O
lightning O
to O
take O
shape O
. O

In O
just O
the O
last O

dry O

sparked O
deadly O

destructive O
wildfires O
such O
as O
the O
Bootleg B-LOC

in O
Oregon B-LOC
that O
burned O
more O

400,000 O

— O
California B-LOC

So O
we O
can O
say O
that O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
trend O
in O
lightning O
is O
doing O
, O
when O
lightning O
happens O
with O
a O
hotter O
, O
drier O
atmosphere O
and O

, O
it’s O
just O
going O
to O
lead O
to O
more O
of O
a O
risk O
of O
these O
kinds O
of O
wildfire O
outbreaks O
like O
we O
saw O
in O
2020 O

For O

The O
bodies O
– O
one O
of O
which O
was O
found O
in O
a O
corroding O

with O
a O
gunshot O
wound O
– O
could O
have O
been O
submerged O
in O
the O

decades O
ago O
, O
leaving O
the O
three O
sets O

in O
advanced O
stages O
of O
decomposition O
and O
making O
it O
increasingly O
difficult O
to O

. O

But O
officials O
have O
already O
discovered O
key O
details O
, O
which O
they O
revealed O
to O
CNN B-ORG
, O
including O
confirmation O
that O
the O
gunshot O
victim’s O
death O
was O
a O

. O

When O

Hemenway B-LOC

on O

1 O
to O
investigate O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
set O
of O

in O
a O

, O
investigators O
immediately O
treated O
it O
as O
a O

, O
not O
waiting O
to O

a O
confirmation O
from O

told O
CNN B-ORG

The O
gunshot O
wound O
was O
obvious O
, O
he O
said O
, O
and O
the O
circumstances O
clearly O
suspicious O
. O

Clark B-LOC
County I-LOC
Coroner O
Melanie B-PER
Rouse I-PER
has O
since O
preliminarily O
ruled O
the O
cause O
and O
manner O
of O
death O
was O
homicide O
by O
gunshot O
and O
also O
said O
her O
office O
is O
submitting O
specimens O
from O
the O
remains O
to O
try O
to O
extract O
DNA O

If O
DNA O
is O
found O
, O
it O
will O
also O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
FBI B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
assisting O
in O
the O
case O
, O
she O
said O
. O

The O
remains O
, O
dubbed O
Hemenway B-LOC
Harbor I-LOC
Doe I-LOC
by O
the O
coroner’s O
office O
, O
are O
one O
of O
at O
least O
three O
sets O
uncovered O
due O
to O
the O
dramatically O
receding O
water O
levels O
at O
Lake B-LOC
Mead I-LOC
, O
which O
has O
plunged O
to O
unprecedented O
lows O
amid O
a O
critical O
water O
crisis O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
. O

Police O
previously O
announced O
they O
placed O
the O
Hemenway B-LOC
Harbor I-LOC
Doe’s O
approximate O
time O
of O
death O
as O
sometime O
in O
the O
mid-’70s O
to O
early O
‘80s O
, O
based O
on O
the O
victim’s O
clothes O
and O
shoes O
. O

Johansson B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
the O
clothing O
was O
so O
well O
preserved O
in O
the O
freshwater O
environment O
that O
investigators O
were O
still O
able O
to O
read O
the O
clothing O
labels O

But O
without O
an O
ID O
, O
investigators O
are O
extremely O
limited O
. O

And O
the O
more O
time O
passes O
, O
the O
harder O
it O
will O
be O
to O
identify O
aging O
witnesses O
and O
potential O
suspects O
. O

If O
you O
think O
about O
what O
the O
age O
of O
who O
your O
witnesses O
or O
anybody O
related O
to O
this O
case O
would O
be O
, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
getting O
older O
every O
day O
. O

And O
they’re O
at O
an O
age O
where O
you O
have O
to O
worry O
, O
are O
they O
even O
alive O
? O

And O
so O
I O
would O
say O
that’s O
probably O
our O
biggest O
concern O
right O
now O
, O
Johansson B-PER
said O
. O

Rouse O
has O
preliminarily O
determined O
that O
the O
age O
of O
the O
person O
in O
the O
second O
set O
of O
remains O
– O
found O
on O
May O
7 O
at O
Calville B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
– O
is O
approximately O
between O
23 O
and O
37 O
years O
old O

While O
she O
couldn’t O
confidently O
determine O
how O
the O
person O
died O
– O
meaning O
the O
preliminary O
cause O
of O
death O
is O
undetermined O
– O
the O
coroner’s O
office O
is O
sending O
specimens O
to O
be O
examined O
for O
any O
potential O
DNA O
. O

The O
Calville B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
remains O
are O
more O
skeletal O
than O
the O
other O
two O
sets O
, O
Rouse B-PER
said O
, O
which O
both O
still O
have O
organ O
tissue O
available O
for O
examination O
, O
despite O
being O
immersed O
in O
the O
lake O
. O

The O
cooler O
underwater O
temperatures O
would O
cause O
a O
body O
to O
decompose O
more O
slowly O
than O
if O
it O
were O
baking O
under O
the O
desert O
sun O
, O
she O
explained O
. O

The O
final O
remains O
were O
found O
at O
the O
lake’s O
Swim O
Beach O
on O
July O
25 O
and O
the O
examination O
is O
still O
at O
an O
early O
stage O
, O
Rouse B-PER
said O
. O

Unlike O
the O
other O
two O
, O
these O
are O
only O
partial O
remains O
and O
Rouse B-PER
is O
still O
processing O
them O
to O
determine O
what O
can O
even O
be O
examined O
based O
on O
their O
condition O
, O
she O
said O
. O

The O
remains O
are O
undergoing O
toxicology O
and O
other O
testing O
before O
a O
cause O
and O
manner O
of O
death O
can O
be O
determined O
, O
the O
coroner O
said O
. O

Police O
are O
not O
investigating O
the O
other O
two O
sets O
of O
remains O
because O
there O
is O
so O
far O
no O
sign O
of O
foul O
play O
or O
suspicious O
circumstances O
in O
the O
deaths O
, O
Johansson B-PER
said O
, O
but O
he O
has O
no O
doubt O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
Hemenway B-LOC
Harbor I-LOC
Doe’s O
death O
are O
nefarious O
. O

Anytime O
you O
have O
a O
body O
in O
a O
barrel O
, O
clearly O
there O
was O
somebody O
else O
involved O
, O
he O
said O
. O

No O
strong O
connection O
to O
organized O
crime O
yet O
, O
police O
say O
Theories O
of O
mob O
involvement O
in O
the O
Hemenway B-LOC
Harbor I-LOC
Doe’s O
death O
began O
to O
swirl O
as O
soon O
as O
details O
emerged O
that O
the O
remains O
were O
found O
inside O
a O
barrel O
. O

Those O
ideas O
were O
fueled O
even O
more O
when O
police O
announced O
the O
victim O
was O
likely O
killed O
at O
a O
time O
when O
organized O
crime O
had O
a O
strong O
grasp O
on O
Las B-LOC
Vegas I-LOC
. O

But O
those O
ideas O
are O
“mere O
speculation” O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
investigation, O
Johansson B-PER
said, O
denying O
that O
there O
is O
any O
solid O
evidence O
to O
support O
mob O
theories. O

Yes O
, O
Vegas B-LOC
does O
have O
a O
history O
in O
the O
past O
where O
we O
had O
a O
connection O
to O
violent O
crime O
, O
to O
organized O
crime O
back O
in O
the O
’ O
60s O
, O
the O
70s O
, O
he O
said O
. O

However O
, O
right O
now O
, O
there’s O
nothing O
in O
this O
investigation O
that O
is O
directly O
tying O
it O
organized O
crime O
. O

At O
its O
height O
in O
1983 O
, O
Lake B-LOC
Mead I-LOC
was O
1,225 O
feet O
above O
sea O
level O
. O

But O
as O
the O
climate O
crisis O
fuels O
a O
prolonged O
mega-drought O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
the O
lake O
, O
which O
serves O
as O
the O
nation’s O
largest O
reservoir O
, O
has O
plummeted O
to O
sobering O
levels O
. O

This O
year O
it O
hit O
its O
lowest O
level O
since O
it O
was O
filled O
in O
the O
1930s O

One O
possible O
scenario O
for O
the O
second O
two O
remains O
is O
that O
they O
belong O
to O
people O
who O
previously O
drowned O
at O
the O
lake O
when O
water O
levels O
were O
high O
, O
a O
National B-ORG
Parks I-ORG
Service I-ORG
spokesperson O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

Recovery O
divers O
are O
limited O
on O
how O
deep O

can O
go O
, O
so O
some O
drowning O
victims’ O
remains O
do O
not O
get O

, O
they O
said O

It’s O
likely O
that O
we O
will O
find O
additional O
bodies O
that O
have O
been O
dumped O
in O
Lake B-LOC

as O
the O

The O

and O
the O

How O
the O
coroner’s O
office O
conducts O
examinations O
In O
addition O
to O
traditional O
autopsies O
, O
examiners O
at O
the O
Clark B-LOC
County I-LOC
coroner’s O
office O
have O
a O
number O
of O
techniques O
they O
can O
use O
to O
uncover O
details O
about O
a O
body O
, O
including O
X-rays O
, O
fingerprinting O
, O
forensic O
dentistry O
and O
analysis O
by O
forensic O
anthropologists O
, O
Rouse B-PER
said O
. O

In O
cases O
where O
we O
are O
limited O
[ O
on O
identification O
methods O
] O
, O
we O
would O
also O
conduct O
DNA O
analysis O
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
noting O
that O
method O
may O
not O
be O
ideal O
for O
some O
extremely O
decomposed O
remains O
. O

For O
the O
two O
sets O
of O
Lake B-LOC
Mead I-LOC
remains O
from O
which O
the O
office O
is O
trying O
to O
extract O
DNA O
, O
those O
specimens O
would O
have O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
a O
lab O
, O
she O
said O
. O

The O
condition O
of O
the O
body O
is O
essential O
in O
the O
examination O
process O
, O
she O
said O
, O
because O
more O
degraded O
remains O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
be O
fingerprinted O
or O
provide O
dental O
information O
. O

The O
coroner’s O
office O
was O
able O
to O
perform O
forensic O
dentistry O
on O
the O
first O
two O
sets O
of O
Lake B-LOC
Mead I-LOC
remains O
, O
she O
said O
. O

Examiners O
then O
compare O
the O
dental O
information O
to O
a O
dental O
records O
database O
, O
she O
said O
, O
so O
it’s O
especially O
important O
to O

that O
a O

dental O

But O
they O

have O
stories O
of O
barely O
surviving O
the O
cruel O
wake O
once O
the O
water O
receded O

the O

of O
Fleming-Neon B-LOC

where O
there’s O

We’re O
survivors O

More O
than O
a O
week O
after O
the O

, O
Fleming-Neon B-LOC

still O
cries O
when O
recalling O
the O
devastation O
she O
saw O
in O
its O
aftermath O
. O

Well, O
I O
wasn’t O
prepared. O

But O
what O
can O
you O
do O
when O
your O
little O
town O
is O
, O
your O
little O
city O
is O
devastated O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
war O
zone O
,” O
she O
said O

City B-LOC

leaving O

this O

out O
of O
a O

a O

over O
a O

The O
water O

on O

lining O
Main B-LOC

reach O
well O
over O
6 O
feet O

The O
water O

broke O

all O

in O

the O

nothing O

Like O
many O
other O
communities O
in O
the O

, O
there O
isn’t O
any O
clean O

Our O
vision O
is O
to O
build O
this O
back O
better O
than O
it O
was O
before O
, O
before O
the O
rain O
, O
” O
said O
Bormes B-PER

With O
a O
catch O
in O
his O
throat O
, O
he O
took O
a O
moment O
to O
collect O
his O
emotions O
before O
continuing O
. O

Because O
these O
people O
deserve O
it O

They O
deserve O
to O
have O
what O
they O
had O
before O
and O
more O
. O

Fleming-Neon B-LOC
was O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
reach O
in O
the O
first O
days O
after O
the O
flood O
, O
so O
help O
came O
from O
within O
the O
community O
. O

Polis O
recalled O
people O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
holler O
until O
neighbors O
acted O

They O
had O
a O
bridge O
to O
basically O
disintegrate O

And O
for O
that O
night O
, O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
Thursday B-LOC
night O
and O
into O
Friday B-LOC
afternoon O
, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
in O
and O
no O
way O
out O
, O
for O
those O
people O
, O
” O
Polis B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
So O
, O
some O
citizens O
, O
before O
all O
this O
heavy O
equipment O
started O
coming O
in O

the O

how O
he O
survived O
the O

Bolling O
, O
who O
people O
around O
town O
call O
Spanky O
, O
received O
a O
call O
that O
the O
fire O
station O
in O
nearby O
Jeremiah B-LOC
was O
flooding O
. O

He O
drove O
his O
pickup O
to O
the O
station O
, O
in O
part O
to O
move O
vehicles O
to O
avoid O
damage O
. O

In O
hindsight O
, O
he O
admitted O
the O
decision O
wasn’t O
good O
. O

The O
water O
started O
to O
rise O
quickly O
as O
he O
pulled O
up O
to O
the O
station O
, O
trapping O
him O
inside O
his O
truck O
, O
which O
he O
said O
began O
floating O
with O
the O
current O
. O

His O
only O
option O
was O
to O
try O
to O
steer O
the O
truck O
into O
an O
old O
tanker O
he O
had O
left O
parked O
outside O
the O
station O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Unable O
to O
open O
the O
truck’s O
door O
or O
window O
, O
“ O
I O
reached O
and O
found O
my O
pistol O
in O
the O
back O
seat O
, O
and O
I O
shot O
the O
window O
out O
of O
my O
Chevy B-ORG
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

Diving O
out O
the O
window O
, O
he O
made O
it O
to O
safety O
by O
climbing O
on O
top O
of O
the O
tanker O
, O
where O
he O
remained O
for O
15 O
hours O
as O
flood O
waters O
, O
downed O
trees O
and O
debris O
rushed O
past O
him O
. O

I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
to O
think O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
,” O
Bolling B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

I O
found O
peace O

I O
wasn’t O
scared O

I O
had O
a O
long O
talk O
with O
the O
Lord O

While O
stranded O
, O
Bolling B-PER
texted O
his O
mother O

I O

everything O

The O
Letcher B-LOC

Insurance O
won’t O
be O
enough O
to O
cover O
all O
the O
damages O
, O
according O
to O
Bolling B-PER

While O
Bolling B-PER
plans O
to O
get O
the O
station O
straightened O
out O
, O
he O
also O
has O
to O
address O
his O
own O

he O
said O

He O
hasn’t O
been O
able O
to O

often O

water O

his O

I’m O
having O
a O

of O
trouble O

I’m O
not O

he O
said O

He O
plans O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
therapist O
and O
hopes O
others O
who O
survived O
the O
storm O
can O
do O
the O
same O
. O

PTSD O
is O
real O
, O
and O
I O
kind O
of O
wondered O
about O
things O

like O
how O
to O
go O
forward O
, O
but O
you O
know O
, O
I O
gotta O
fix O
myself O
first O

” O
he O
said O
. O

But O
along O
with O
the O
sorrow O
, O
there’s O
pride O
, O
too O
, O
in O
the O
way O
their O
Appalachian B-LOC
community O
has O
come O
together O

with O
neighbors O

lost O
everything O
helping O
neighbors O
in O
the O

been O
sweeping O

using O
small O
bulldozers O
to O

out O

week O

And O
while O
proud O
of O
their O
independent O

, O
officials O
in O
Fleming-Neon B-LOC
admit O
the O

is O
desperate O
for O
all O

can O
get O

Our O
infrastructure O
needs O
help O
from O

We’re O
going O
to O
have O
to O
have O
a O

of O
help,” O
Fire O

Gary B-PER
Clink I-PER
, O
who O
has O
lived O
just O
outside O
of O
Hindman B-LOC

decades O
, O
was O
rescued O
, O
along O
with O
his O
wife O

a O
neighbor O
, O
by O
his O
son-in-law O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Now O
he’s O
trying O
to O
save O
his O
wet O
furniture O
from O
mildew O
in O
the O
muddy O
interior O
of O
his O
home O
, O
which O
had O
more O
than O
4 O
feet O
of O
water O
in O
it O
during O
the O
flood O
. O

It’s O
like O
someone O
turned O
the O
switch O
to O
maximum O
overdrive O
,” O
explained O
Clink B-PER
as O
he O
sat O
on O
the O
porch O
looking O
at O
what O
was O
left O
of O
his O
belongings O
drying O
out O
on O
the O
lawn O
, O
“I’ve O
never O
seen O
water O
like O
that O
.” O

It’s O
like O
a O
dam O
burst O
or O
a O
tsunami O
. O

That’s O
the O
reason O
you O
see O
garbage O
wherever O
you O
look O
, O
houses O
wrecked O
. O

I’ve O
seen O
three O
homes O
I O
knew O
basically O
lifted O
up O
off O
the O
foundation O
base O
, O
as O
they O
washed O
down O
the O
stream O
and O
it O
ripped O
them O
apart O
. O

And O
he O
worries O
that O
this O
catastrophe O
won’t O
be O
the O
last O

I O
believe O
you’re O
seeing O
the O
effects O
of O
climate O
change O
right O
here O
,” O
Clink B-PER
said O
. O

Just O
given O
time O
, O
if O
we O
don’t O
turn O
it O
around O
, O
just O
given O
time O
, O
it’s O
going O
to O
get O
worse O
. O

Some O
are O
also O
concerned O
that O
people O
will O
leave O
the O
area O
because O
the O
devastation O
is O
too O
extreme O
. O

This O
is O
literally O
the O
end O
of O
this O
little O
community O
,” O
Clink B-PER
sighed O
, O
“ O
These O
people O
, O
you’ll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
had O
decent O
appliances O

decent O
furniture O

decent O
clothes O

but O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
decent O

“ O

If O
they O
didn’t O
have O
flood O
insurance O
or O
FEMA B-ORG
can’t O
step O
in O

actually O
help… O
this O
is O
the O
end O

the O
line O
for O
this O

I O
don’t O
see O
any O
way O

are O
going O
to O
come O
back O
from O
it O

Bolling O
agreed O

“ O

It’s O
country O
back O
here O

It’s O
slow O

I O

, O
we O
love O
it O

We O
stay O
back O
here O

Bolling B-PER

“ O

at O
the O

it’s O
never O

There O
will O
be O
a O

I O
know O
that O

have O
nothing O

we’ll O

it O

The O
three O

Here’s O
what O
we O

about O
the O

the O
investigation O
so O
far O
: O
How O
did O
the O
killings O
happen O
? O

The O
most O
recent O

. O

After O
the O
discovery O
, O
Albuquerque B-LOC
police O
said O
the O
homicide O
“ O
may O
be O
connected O
” O
to O
three O
previous O
killings O
of O
Muslim O
men O
from O
South B-LOC

. O

Those O
three O
men O

“ O
ambushed O
with O
no O

and O
were O
killed O
in O
Southeast B-LOC

. O

Police O
said O
they O
“determined O
there O
is O
a O
connection” O
between O
those O
two O
deaths. O

On O
August O
1 O
, O
police O
got O
a O
call O
about O
a O
drive-by O
shooting O
near O
the O
intersection O
of O
Cornell B-LOC

and O
Garfield B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC

They O
found O
Muhammad B-PER
Afzaal I-PER
Hussain I-PER
with O
multiple O
gunshot O
wounds O
, O
according O
to O
a O
criminal O
complaint O
obtained O
from O

Detectives O
learned O
that O
the O
gunman O
had O
waited O
behind O
a O
bush O
near O
the O
driveway O
where O
the O
victim O
usually O
parks O
his O
vehicle O
and O
then O
fired O
through O
the O
bush O
multiple O
times O
when O
Hussein B-PER
got O
out O

states O
. O

Police O
found O
that O

and O
July O
26 O
shootings O
were O
likely O
fired O
from O
the O
same O
firearm O
, O
according O
to O
Hartsock B-PER

As O
investigators O
probed O
those O
two O
recent O

they O
turned O
their O
attention O
to O
the O

“ O

asked O

not O

her O
last O

​ O
out O
of O
fear O
for O

, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
she O
decided O
to O
take O
her O
young O

the O

because O
she O
thought O
it O
was O
important O
to O
learn O
about O
inclusivity O

different O
communities O

I O
love O
drag O
queens O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
fun O
, O
it O
is O
art O

it O
is O
a O
laugh O

and O
something O
different O
that O
involves O
books O

stories O

” O
she O
said O

But O
Rosie B-PER
said O
she O
was O
unprepared O
for O
the O
vitriol O
she O
encountered O
at O
the O
library O
, O
where O
protesters O
waved O
signs O
reading O
“Stop O
grooming O
children” O
and O
a O
line O
of O
police O
officers O
ushered O
parents O
into O
the O

At O
least O
one O
mother O
was O
crying O
inside O

played O
the O
theme O
song O
to O
British B-LOC
TV O
show O
“Jim’ll B-PER

whose O
late O
host O
was O
a O
notorious O
child O
sexual O

on O
loudspeakers O
outside O

It O
was O
just O
horrible O

I O
was O
expecting O
it O
to O
be O
a O
joyous O
thing O

considering O
it O
had O
been O
Pride O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O

in O
Bristol B-LOC

Instead, O
she O
said O
the O
harassment O
by O
protesters O
was O
“very O
backwards O
and O
(I O
feel) O
naive O
to O
think O
there’s O
been O
any O

Sometimes O
polling O
trends O
meet O
your O
expectations O

For O
example O
, O
you O
might O
expect O
a O
president’s O
approval O
rating O
to O
be O
low O
when O
we’re O
dealing O
with O
high O
inflation O
and O
negative O
growth O
in O
real O
disposable O
income O
per O

Sometimes O
, O
however O
, O
trends O
in O
public O
opinion O
are O
surprising O
. O

Even O
as O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden’s I-PER
approval O
rating O
languishes O
south O
of O
40% O
, O
Democrats O
aren’t O
just O
holding O
their O
own O
on O
the O
generic O
congressional O
ballot O

They’re O
actually O
improving O
their O
position O
as O
Biden’s B-PER
standing O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
gets O
worse O

It’s O
with O
this O
odd O
phenomenon O
that O
we O
start O
our O
look O
at O
the O
political O
week O
that O
was O

Biden’s O
unpopular, O
but O
so O
are O
Republicans B-ORG
Republicans I-ORG
now O
hold O
an O
average O
advantage O
of O
less O
than O
a O
point O
on O
the O
generic O
congressional O
ballot, O
which O
usually O
asks O
respondents O
some O
form O
of O
the O
following O
question: O
“If O
the O
elections O
for O
Congress O
were O
held O
today, O
would O
you O
vote O
for O
the O
Democratic B-ORG

party? O

Republicans O
were O
ahead O
on O
this O
metric O
by O
3 O
to O
4 O
points O
in O
May B-LOC

Our O
CNN B-ORG
/ O
SSRS I-ORG
poll O
published O
a O
little O
less O
than O
two O
weeks O
ago O
was O
one O
of O
several O
recent O
surveys O
that O
have O
reflected O
this O
tightening O

Republicans O
were O
ahead O
by O
an O
average O
of O
4 O
points O
in O
the O
two O
polls O
CNN B-ORG
released O
in O
May B-LOC
that O
included O
this O
question O

The O
two O
parties O
were O
tied O
in O
the O
poll O
released O
this O
month O

When O
we O
examine O
this O
latest O
CNN B-ORG
poll O
more O
closely O
, O
we O
get O
a O
very O
good O
idea O
of O
why O
Democrats O
are O
even O
with O
Republicans O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
. O

It’s O
because O
Republicans O
are O
also O
unpopular O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
voters O
who O
don’t O
like O
either O
Biden B-PER
or O
the O
GOP O

Biden’s O
favorable O
rating O
in O
the O
poll O
was O
just O
38% O
among O
those O
who O
were O
asked O
the O
generic O
ballot O
question O

His O
unfavorable O
rating O
stood O
at O
55% O
. O

Biden’s O
net O
favorability O
was O
-17 O
points O
. O

The O
Republican B-ORG
Party’s I-ORG
standing O
wasn’t O
really O
any O
better O
. O

Only O
35% O
rated O
the O
party O
favorably O

A O
plurality O
(50%) O
had O
an O
unfavorable O
view O
. O

The O
GOP O
’s O
net O
favorability O
was O
-15 O
points O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
33% O
of O
the O
electorate O
holds O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Republicans B-ORG
and O
does O
not O
have O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Biden B-PER

The O
Republicans B-ORG
are O
winning O
this O
group O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
, O
96% O
to O
2% O
. O

Likewise O
, O
36% O
of O
the O
electorate O
holds O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Biden B-PER
and O
doesn’t O
have O
a O
favorable O
view O
of O
Republicans O
. O

Democrats O
are O
crushing O
among O
this O
group O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
, O
94% O
to O
1% O
. O

The O
other O
big O
chunk O
of O
the O
electorate O
(29%) O
is O
made O
up O
of O
those O
who O
like O
neither O
Biden B-PER
nor O
the O
Republicans B-ORG
. O

These O
voters O
are O
more O
divided O
in O
their O
generic O
ballot O
preferences O
, O
with O
Republicans B-ORG
at O
42% O
and O
Democrats B-ORG
at O
35% O
. O

Because O
there O
are O
slightly O
more O
people O
who O
like O
Biden B-PER
than O
those O
who O
like O
the O
GOP O
and O
since O
the O
group O
that O
doesn’t O
like O
either O
has O
relatively O
close O
preferences O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
, O
the O
race O
overall O
remains O
tight O
. O

The O
question O
is O
whether O
the O
current O
polling O
can O
possibly O
hold O
through O
Election O
Day O

Midterms O
are O
usually O
a O
referendum O
on O
the O
president’s O
party O

Anger O
at O
the O
president’s O
party O
could O
be O
what O
ultimately O
sways O
voters O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
current O
polling O
is O
, O
in O
some O
ways O
, O
reminiscent O
of O
what O
occurred O
during O
the O
2016 O
presidential O
election O
. O

Nearly O
20% O
of O
the O
electorate O
did O
not O
look O
favorably O
on O
both O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
and O
Hillary B-PER
Clinton I-PER
. O

Trump O
won O
this O
group O
by O
nearly O
20 O
points O
and O
with O
them O
, O
the O
election O
. O

When O
you O
look O
at O
the O
voters O
who O
are O
backing O
Democratic O
congressional O
candidates O
but O
don’t O
like O
Biden B-PER
, O
the O
current O
numbers O
actually O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
. O

These O
voters O
overwhelmingly O
lean O
Democratic O
(85%) O
when O
asked O
about O
their O
party O
identification O
. O

They’re O
also O
overwhelmingly O
young O
(79% O
are O
under O
the O
age O
of O
50) O

The O
latter O
of O
which O
is O
consistent O
with O
something O
I O
noticed O
earlier O
this O
cycle O

Biden B-PER
’s O
favorable O
rating O
among O
those O
under O
50 O
is O
shockingly O
low O
( O
32 O
%) O
given O
that O
younger O
voters O
are O
usually O
part O
of O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
base O
. O

Yet, O
these O
same O
voters O
are O
going O
48% O
to O
39% O
for O
Democrats B-ORG
on O
the O
generic O
ballot. O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
Republicans O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
count O
on O
voters O
defaulting O
to O
them O

Put O
another O
way O
, O
Democrats O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
win O
this O
upcoming O
midterm O
. O

Republicans O
, O
though O
, O
could O
definitely O
lose O
it O
. O

January O
6 O
hearings O
may O
have O
hurt O
Trump B-PER
Another O
related O
reason O
Republicans B-ORG
may O
be O
hurting O
in O
the O
polls O
has O
to O
do O
with O
what O
has O
been O
in O
the O
news O

Mainly O
, O
the O
former O
President O
has O
been O
in O
the O
news O
a O
lot O
lately O
. O

Republicans O
have O
generally O
been O
better O
off O
without O
him O
in O
the O
news O
, O
and O
the O
same O
is O
true O
for O
Trump B-PER
himself O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
he’s O
been O
getting O
more O
unpopular O
of O
late O

His O
net O
favorability O
rating O
stands O
south O
of O
-15 O
points O
in O
an O
average O
of O
recent O
polls O

That’s O
the O
worst O
it’s O
been O
in O
over O
a O
year O
. O

Trump’s O
net O
favorability O
rating O
has O
shrunk O
every O
month O
since O
March B-LOC
. O

That O
drop O
has O
been O
most O
dramatic O
this O
past O
month O
, O
when O
he O
was O
most O
in O
the O
news O
. O

Trump’s B-PER
net O
favorability O
is O
now O
lower O
than O
his O
average O
net O
approval O
rating O
during O
his O
time O
in O
office O
. O

And O
that’s O
going O
to O
be O
compounded O
by O
the O
betrayal O
of O
trust O
that O
they’re O
going O
to O
feel O
because O
a O
community O
member O
here O
is O
alleged O
to O
have O
committed O
these O

we O
found O
that O
they O
were O
wrong. O

And O
people O
can O
be O
wrong O
, O
but O
how O
in O
the O
world O
can O
it O
be O
inflammatory O
: O

Manchin B-PER
told O
Tapper B-PER
. O

How O
can O
it O
add O
flames O
to O
inflation O
fires O
right O
now O
if O
you’re O
paying O
down O
debt O
? O

He O
added: O
“We’re O
doing O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
attack O
the O
problem. O

And O
these O
are O
solutions O
to O
the O
problems O
we O
have O

So O
I O
know O
the O
ones O
playing O
politics O
with O
it O
.” O

When O
Manchin B-PER
and I-PER
Schumer I-PER
, O
a O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
Democrat O
, O
announced O
the O
deal O
last O
week O
, O
it O
represented O
a O
breakthrough O
after O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
negotiations O
that O
have O
collapsed O
time O
and O
again O

Though O
many O
details O
have O
not O
been O
disclosed O
, O
the O
measure O
would O
invest O
$369 O
billion O
into O
energy O
and O
climate O
change O
programs O
, O
with O
the O
goal O
of O
reducing O
carbon O
emissions O
by O
40% O
by O
2030 O
, O
according O
to O
a O
one-page O
fact O
sheet O
. O

It O
would O
also O
address O
the O
permitting O
of O
energy O
infrastructure O
, O
which O
could O
ease O
the O
path O
for O
a O
shale O

in O

Manchin B-PER
on O
Sunday O
was O
asked O
about O
getting O
fellow O
moderate O
Democratic O
Sen. O
Kyrsten B-PER
Sinema’s I-PER
support O
for O
the O
legislation O

Sen. O
Sinema B-PER
is O
my O
dear O
friend. O

We O
work O
very O
close O
together O
on O
so O
many O
things O
, O
and O
she O
has O
so O
much O
in O
this O
piece O
of O
legislation O
. O

She’s O
formed O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
and O
worked O
on O
it O
very O
hard O

And O
with O
that O
, O
she’s O
brought O
down O
drug O
prices O
, O
she’s O
been O
very O
instrumental O
in O
letting O
Medicare B-ORG
go O
ahead O
and O
negotiate O
for O
lower O
drug O
prices O
, O
” O
Manchin B-PER
said O
of O
the O
Arizona B-LOC
senator O
. O

He O
added O
: O
“ O
I O
think O
that O
basically O
when O
she O
looks O
at O
the O
bill O
and O
sees O
the O
whole O
spectrum O
of O
what O
we’re O
doing O
… O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
positive O
about O
it O
, O
but O
she’ll O
make O
her O
decision O
and O
I O
respect O
that O
.” O

Manchin B-PER
also O
defended O
a O
provision O
in O
the O
bill O
that O
would O
impose O
a O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
on O
certain O
corporations O
. O

People O
should O
be O
paying O
their O
fair O
share O
, O
especially O
the O
largest O
corporations O
in O
America B-LOC
that O
have O
a O
billion O
dollars O
of O
value O
or O
greater O
. O

Can’t O
they O
pay O
at O
least O
15% O
, O
so O
that O
we O
can O
move O
forward O
and O
be O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
world O
and O
the O
superpower O
that O
we O
are O
? O

he O
told O
Tapper B-PER
, O
adding O
that O
the O
bill O
“ O
was O
not O
putting O
a O
burden O
on O
any O
taxpayers O
whatsoever O
.” O

Republicans O
on O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Finance I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on O
Saturday O
released O
data O
from O
the O
nonpartisan O
Joint B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on O
Taxation I-ORG
that O
showed O
that O
Americans O
of O
all O
incomes O
would O
see O
their O
federal O
taxes O
rise O
under O
the O
climate O
and O
health O
care O
package O

That O
analysis O
, O
however O
, O
looked O
at O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
the O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
provision O
on O
corporations O
. O

Economists O
assume O
companies O
would O
then O
pass O
along O
part O
of O
their O
tax O
increase O
to O
employees O
by O
reducing O
their O
after-tax O
wages O
and O
job O
opportunities O

Also O
, O
shareholders O
would O
take O
a O
hit O
since O
the O
value O
of O
their O
stock O
holdings O
, O
including O
those O
held O
in O
pensions O
and O
mutual O
funds O
, O
would O
likely O
decline O
. O

Manchin B-PER
said O
Sunday O
he O
hopes O
the O
legislation O
passes O
before O
the O
August O
recess O
, O
which O
is O
what O
Democratic O
leadership O
is O
hoping O
for O
. O

The O
senator’s O
support O
is O
notable O
given O
his O
stance O
earlier O
this O
month O
that O
he O
“unequivocally” O
wouldn’t O
support O
the O
climate O
or O
tax O
provisions O
of O
the O
Democratic O
economic O
package O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
torpedo O
any O
hope O
Democrats O
had O
of O
passing O
legislation O
to O
fight O
climate O
change O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

But O
he O
told O
Tapper B-PER
on O
Sunday O
that O
he O
“never O
did O
walk O
away” O
from O
negotiations O
with O
Schumer B-PER
. O

I O
never O
did O
walk O
away O
, O
but O
we O
reorganized O
the O
bill O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
he O
said O
. O
“ O

What O
we O
had O
before O
that O
, O
there O
were O
things O
in O
there O
that O
I O
considered O
and O
thought O
could O
be O
considered O
to O
be O
inflammatory O
. O
… O

Inflation O
is O
the O
greatest O
challenge O
we O
have O
in O
our O
country O
right O
now O
– O
around O
in O
my O
state O
and O
around O
the O
country O

So O
that’s O
what O
we’re O
fighting O
. O

Republican O
Sen. O
Pat B-PER
Toomey I-PER
of O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
slammed O
the O
deal O
in O
a O
separate O
appearance O
later O
on O
“State B-ORG
of I-ORG
the O
Union,” I-ORG
arguing O
that O
it O
would O
negatively O
impact O
the O
US B-ORG
economy O
at O
a O
critical O
time. O

We O
haven’t O
seen O
any O
text O
, O
we O
don’t O
even O
know O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
disaster O

This O
is O
going O
to O
make O
our O
recession O
worse O

It’s O
going O
to O
make O
inflation O
worse O

It’s O
not O
gonna O
do O
any O
good O

I O
am O
really O
surprised O
that O
Joe B-PER
agreed O
to O
this,” O
he O
told O
Tapper. O

The O

, O
which O

execution O
of O
a O
search O
warrant O
also O
comes O
just O
days O
after O
the O
news O
broke O
that O
lawyers O
for O
Trump B-PER
are O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
in O
regards O
to O
its O
ongoing O
investigation O
into O
the O
January B-LOC

2021 O
, O
riot O
at O
the O
US B-LOC
Capitol I-LOC
. O

As O
CNN B-ORG
first O
reported O
: O
“ O
The O
talks O
revolve O
around O
whether O
Trump B-PER
would O
be O
able O
to O
shield O
conversations O
he O
had O
while O
he O
was O
president O
from O
federal O
investigators O
. O
“ O

In O
recent O
weeks O
, O
investigators O
have O
moved O
aggressively O
into O
Trump’s B-PER
orbit O
, O
subpoenaing O
top O
former O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
, O
focusing O
on O
efforts O
to O
overturn O
the O
2020 O
election O
and O
executing O
searches O
of O
lawyers O
who O
sought O
to O
aid O
those O
efforts O
. O

Trump B-PER
, O
CNN B-ORG
has O
also O
reported O
, O
has O
quizzed O
his O
legal O
team O
of O
late O
as O
to O
whether O
he O
might O
be O
indicted O
, O
although O
he O
himself O
is O
skeptical O
it O
will O
come O
to O
that O
. O

Worth O
noting: O
Trump B-PER
is O
not O
a O
lawyer O
) O

The O
series O
of O
developments O
– O
culminating O
with O
the O
high-profile O
search O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
home O
on O
Monday O
– O
reinforce O
a O
fundamental O
fact O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
situation O
: O
He O
is O
far O
more O
likely O
to O
see O
a O
2024 O
run O
for O
president O
curtailed O
by O
legal O
problems O
than O
political O
ones O
. O

Politically, O
Trump B-PER
remains O
the O
800-pound O
gorilla O
in O
the O
Republican B-ORG
field. O

Over O
the O
weekend O
, O
he O
convincingly O
won O
a O
straw O
poll O
at O
a O
conservative O
gathering O
in O
Texas B-LOC
. O

And, O
he O
has O
all O
but O
announced O
his O
intention O
to O
run O
again, O
with O
the O
major O
question O
at O
this O
point O
being O
when O
he O
will O
announce O
his O
candidacy O
– O
not O
whether O
he O
will O
do O
so. O

Trump B-PER
posted O
a O
campaign-style O
video O
on O
his O
Truth B-ORG
Social I-ORG
site O
Tuesday O
morning O
, O
saying O
“ O
the O
best O
is O
yet O
to O
come O
. O
” O

Trump’s B-PER
mounting O
legal O
woes O
– O
or O
at O
least O
the O
clear O
sense O
that O
this O
variety O
of O
investigations O
is O
getting O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
him O
– O
complicate O
all O
of O
that O
. O

Trump B-PER
under O
legal O
fire O
is O
one O
thing O
for O
Republicans B-ORG
to O
accept O

Trump O
under O
indictment O
is O
something O
else O
entirely O

We O
are O
of O
course O
, O
not O
there O
yet O
. O

But, O
Monday’s O
FBI B-ORG
activity O
suggests O
that O
Trump’s B-PER
legal O
problems O
are O
likely O
to O
get O
worse O
before O
they O
get O
better. O

And O
they O
may O
get O
way O
, O
way O
worse O
. O

This O
story O
has O

additional O
information O

In O
Michigan B-LOC

jam-packed O
Republican O
primary O
fight O
for O
governor O
, O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
is O
trying O
to O
tip O
the O
scales O
. O

Just O
days O
before O
the O
Tuesday O
primary O
, O
Trump B-PER
threw O
his O
support O
behind O
Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
, O
a O
conservative O
commentator O
who O
has O
coalesced O
support O
from O
prominent O
Republicans B-ORG
in O
the O
state O
, O
even O
as O
she O
beats O
back O
criticism O
that O
she’s O
an O
establishment O
candidate O
who O
isn’t O
“MAGA” O
enough O
to O
inspire O
the O
GOP B-ORG
base O
. O

The O
Mitten B-LOC
State’s I-LOC
prolonged O
, O
often O
bitter O
, O
Republican B-ORG
primary O
saw O
a O
handful O
of O

disqualified O
from O
the O
ballot O
, O
while O
another O
– O
still O
in O
the O
race O
– O
was O
arrested O
for O
his O
alleged O
participation O
in O
the O
January B-LOC
6 O
, O
2021 O
, O
riot O
. O

Dixon O
is O
up O
against O
a O
handful O
of O
Trumpian O
candidates O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
have O
fully O
embraced O
the O
former O
President’s O
lies O
about O
the O
2020 O
election O
. O

Dixon’s O
embrace O
of O
those O
falsehoods O
has O
been O
more O
tepid O

In O
a O
May O
debate O
, O
she O
raised O
her O
hand O
and O
confirmed O
, O
yes O
, O
she O
did O
believe O
Trump B-PER
won O
Michigan B-LOC
– O
a O
state O
he O
lost O
by O
more O
than O
154,000 O
votes O
in O
2020 O
. O

But O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
CNN B-ORG
, O
she O
offered O
a O
more O
muted O
response O
. O

I O
’ve O
talked O
about O
this O
at O
length O
, O
about O
the O
2020 O
election O
, O
” O
Dixon B-PER
said O
. O

It O
was O
unlike O
any O
election O
we O
had O
ever O
seen O
obviously O
because O
of O
the O
pandemic O

But O
in O
Michigan B-LOC
, O
there O
were O
some O
things O
that O
happened O
in O
Michigan B-LOC
that O
didn’t O
happen O
in O
other O
states O
, O
which O
are O
very O
concerning O
. O

In O
interviews O
with O
CNN B-ORG
, O
Dixon’s O
opponents O
quickly O
slammed O
her O
for O
appearing O
to O
water O
down O
her O
views O
on O
the O
2020 O
election O
. O

Garrett B-PER
Soldano I-PER
, O
a O
chiropractor O
vying O
for O
the O
GOP O
nomination O
, O
panned O
Dixon B-PER
for O
dodging O
the O
2020 O
election O
question O
and O
doubled O
down O
on O
his O
support O
for O
the O
former O
President O
. O

The O
election O
, O
in O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
was O
stolen O
, O
he O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
. O
“ O

I’m O
not O
even O
endorsed O
by O
President O
Trump B-PER
, O
and O
I O
still O
have O
his O
back O
. O

Soldano O
then O
turned O
his O
stare O
straight O
down O
the O
lens O
of O
a O
CNN B-ORG
camera O
, O
seemingly O
hoping O
to O
address O
Trump B-PER
directly O
. O

Even O
though O
, O
sir O
, O
you O
didn’t O
endorse O
me O
, O
you’re O
still O
my O

, O
Soldano B-PER
said O
. O

Businessman-turned-candidate O
Kevin B-PER
Rinke I-PER
also O
bashed O
Dixon O
for O
dancing O
around O
election O
falsehoods O

She O
got O
an O
endorsement O
and O
within O
48 O
hours O
when O
she O
was O
asked O
on O
national O
TV O
if O
the O
election O
was O
stolen O
, O
she O
changed O
her O
mind O
, O
Rinke B-PER
said O
. O

That’s O
what O
politicians O
do O

Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
is O
the O
Republican O
version O
of O
Gretchen B-PER
Whitmer I-PER
– O
‘ O
I’ll O
say O
anything O
, O
I’ll O
do O
anything O
for O
position O
and O
power O
, O
’ O
” O
he O
said O
referring O
to O
the O
state’s O
Democratic O
governor O
. O

Rinke O
didn’t O
go O
so O
far O
as O
to O
claim O
the O
election O
was O
stolen O
and O
acknowledged O
that O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
is O
the O
President O

Still O
, O
he O
said O
he O
believes O
there O
were O
“irregularities” O
in O
2020 O
. O

Meantime O
, O
Ryan B-PER
Kelley I-PER
, O
a O
real O
estate O
broker O
in O
the O
race O
, O
has O
essentially O
turned O
his O
arrest O
for O
allegedly O
participating O
in O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
riot O
into O
a O
campaign O
rallying O
cry O
. O

“Look O
how O
hard O
these O
people O
are O
trying O
to O
silence O
me,” O
Kelley B-PER
said O
in O
a O
July O
GOP B-ORG
primary O
debate. O
” O

I O
got O
arrested O

I O
got O

He O
has O
pleaded O
not O
guilty O
to O
the O
misdemeanor O
charges O
he O
faces O
and O
has O
continued O
to O
falsely O
claim O
Trump B-PER
won O
in O
2020 O

Republican O
activists O
here O
have O
rallied O
behind O
Trump-loving O

candidates O

At O
an O

earlier O
this O

backed O
Kristina B-PER

Matthew B-PER
DePerno I-PER
for O
attorney O
general O
, O
paving O
their O
path O
for O
official O
nominations O
later O
this O
year O
. O

If O
they O
win O
in O
November O
, O
they O
would O
be O
in O
key O
positions O
to O
oversee O
the O
state’s O
elections O
. O

But O
the O
prospect O
of O
having O
Dixon B-PER
atop O
the O
ticket O
has O
rankled O
some O
Trump B-ORG
supporters O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
her O
less-than-enthusiastic O

The O

put O
a O
major O

Kajokaya O
said O
this O
jump O
in O
food O
costs O
forces O
many O
people O
to O

on O
just O
one O

a O
day O

But O
inflation O
is O
also O
hurting O
people O
outside O
the O

What O
people O
felt O
most O
immediately O
was O
the O
cost O
of O
fuel O
because O
it O
was O
reflected O
in O
transport O

Costs O
of O
fuel O
quadrupled O
and O
transport O
between O
cities O
doubled O
in O
some O
instances O
. O

For O
some O
families O
, O
the O
rising O
cost O
of O
living O
means O
they O
can O
no O
longer O
afford O
to O
send O
their O
children O
to O
school O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
not O
even O
afford O
lifesaving O
treatment O
. O

Kajokaya O
said O
that O
malaria O
treatment O
costs O
about O
$10 O
, O
but O
“ O
for O
somebody O
who O
makes O
less O
than O
$1 O
a O
day O
, O
it O
can O
be O
really O
tough O
. O
” O

We O
see O
lives O
that O
could O
have O
been O
saved O
, O
just O
perishing O
simply O
because O
people O
can’t O

Climate O
The O
cost O
of O

felt O

a O
large O

of O
wheat O
comes O
from O

climate O

another O

China B-LOC
said O
it O
continued O
military O
drills O
around O
the O
self-governing O
island O
, O
after O
a O
four-day O
show O
of O
force O
following O
US O
House O
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi I-PER
’s O
trip O
to O
Taipei B-LOC
last O
week O
. O

China B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
threatening O
Taiwan B-LOC
for O
years O
and O
it’s O
getting O
more O
serious O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years O
,” O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O

Whether O
Speaker O
Pelosi B-PER
visits O
Taiwan B-LOC
or O
not O
, O
the O
Chinese O
military O
threat O
against O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
there O
and O
that O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
need O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

Welcoming O
overseas O
friends O
to O
the O
island O
was O
a O
key O
part O
of O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
strategy O
to O
counter O
China’s B-LOC
attempts O
to O
isolate O
it O
from O
the O
international O
community O
– O
regardless O
of O
the O
potential O
backlash O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

China) B-LOC
cannot O
dictate O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
we O
should O
not O
welcome O
anyone O
who O
likes O
to O
come O
and O
show O
support O
for O
Taiwan,” B-LOC
said O
Wu, B-PER
who O
has O
served O
as O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
foreign O
minister O
since O
2018. O

In O
an O
exclusive O
interview O
with O
CNN B-ORG
last O
October O
, O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
President O
Tsai B-PER
Ing-wen I-PER
confirmed O
some O
US O
military O
trainers O
were O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
– O
the O
first O
time O
a O
Taiwanese O
leader O
had O
admitted O
to O
their O
presence O
since O
Washington B-LOC
and O
Taipei B-LOC
severed O
diplomatic O
ties O
in O
1979 O
. O

But O
perceptions O
of O
American B-LOC
support O
sparked O
Beijing’s B-LOC
ire O
against O
the O
speaker’s O
visit O
, O
with O
China’s B-LOC
foreign O
ministry O
issuing O
a O
statement O
on O
the O
heels O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
arrival O
Tuesday O
evening O
saying O
her O
trip O
would O
have O
a O
“severe O
impact O
on O
the O
political O
foundation O
of O
China-US B-LOC
relations O
, O
and O
“gravely O
undermines O
peace O
and O
stability O
across O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
. O

Beijing B-LOC
announced O
the O
large-scale O
military O
exercises O
in O
what O
it O
said O
were O
six O
zones O
around O
the O
island O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
swiftly O
after O
Pelosi’s B-PER
arrival O
, O
in O
response O
to O
what O
it O
viewed O
as O
an O
infringement O
of O
China’s B-LOC
“sovereignty O
and O
territorial O
integrity.” O

While O
the O
US B-LOC
and O
many O
of O
its O
allies O
have O
decried O
the O
drills O
, O
China B-LOC
defended O
its O
actions O
as O
“legitimate O
and O
justified,” O
saying O
it O
was O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
not O
China B-LOC
, O
who O
was O
“the O
biggest O
saboteur O
and O
destabilizer O
of O
peace O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait,” O
where O
China B-LOC
claims O
“sovereign O
rights O
and O
jurisdiction.” O

Wrecking’ O
the O
status O
quo O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
China B-LOC
have O
been O
governed O
separately O
since O
the O
end O
of O
a O
civil O
war O
more O
than O
seven O
decades O
ago O
, O
in O
which O
the O
defeated O
Nationalists B-ORG
fled O
to O
Taipei B-LOC
. O

Taiwan B-LOC
transitioned O
from O
authoritarian O
rule O
to O
a O
democracy O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
and O
is O
now O
ranked O
one O
of O
the O
freest O
jurisdictions O
in O
Asia B-LOC
by O
Freedom B-ORG
House I-ORG
, O
a O
US-based O
non-profit O
organization O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
as O
his O
power O
has O
grown O
, O
Chinese O
leader O
Xi B-PER
Jinping I-PER
has O
made O
clear O
his O
ambitions O
to O
“reunify” O
with O
the O
island O
– O
by O
force O
if O
necessary O
. O

Wu O
accused O
China B-LOC
of O
trying O
to O
change O
the O
status O
quo O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
, O
including O
by O
conducting O
military O
exercises O
in O
recent O
days O
across O
the O
median O
line O
– O
the O
halfway O
point O
between O
the O
island O
and O
mainland O
China B-LOC
that O
has O
previously O
been O
an O
informal O
but O
largely O
respected O
border O
of O
control O
between O
Beijing B-LOC
and O
Taipei B-LOC
. O

Dozens O
of O
Chinese O
warplanes O
crossed O
the O
median O
line O
between O
Thursday O
and O
Sunday O
, O
according O
to O
accounts O
from O
Taiwan’s B-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
. O

While O
the O
informal O
median O
line O
has O
largely O
preserved O
peace O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
for O
decades O
, O
China B-LOC
now O
openly O
denies O
its O
existence O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
behavior O
is O
wrecking O
the O
status O
quo O
, O
and O
it’s O
wrecking O
peace O
and O
stability O
in O
this O
region O
and O
it O
should O
not O
be O
accepted O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
, O
adding O
that O
China B-LOC
had O
sought O
to O
declare O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
as O
its O
internal O
waters O
for O
“some O
time” O
before O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit O
. O

That O
had O
implications O
beyond O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
China B-LOC
seeks O
to O
expand O
its O
influence O
across O
the O
Western B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
, O
Wu B-PER
said O

But O
he O
added O
that O
he O
remained O
optimistic O
about O
the O
future O
. O

Democracy O
is O
going O
to O
prevail,” O
he O
said. O
“ O

If O
you O
look O
at O
authoritarianism O
, O
it’s O
not O
resilient O
. O

It O
may O
appear O
strong O
, O
and O
it O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
expanding O
. O

But O
it’s O
not O
resilient O
and O
at O
some O
point O
is O
going O
to O
break O
. O

When O
asked O
if O
the O
situation O
could O
be O
called O
a O
crisis O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
that O
was O
ultimately O
up O
to O
Beijing B-LOC
. O

It O
depends O
on O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Chinese B-LOC
leaders O
to O
see O
whether O
they O
want O
to O
pursue O
the O
relations O
with O
Taiwan B-LOC
… O
in O
a O
peaceful O
and O
stable O
manner O
. O

Wu O
said O
he O
doesn’t O
know O
whether O
Chinese O
leaders O
“have O
made O
up O
their O
mind” O
to O
use O
force O
to O
take O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
but O
Taiwanese O
officials O
were O
“looking O
at O
several O
different O
scenarios,” O
in O
particular O
due O
to O
concerns O
that O
Beijing B-LOC
could O
seek O
to O
divert O
attention O
from O
domestic O
problems O
by O
creating O
a O
crisis O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
. O

“ O
The O
important O
thing O
for O
us O
is O
that O
we O
need O
to O
be O
prepared O
,” O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O
” O

We O
want O
to O
defend O
the O
freedom O
and O
democracy O
that O
we O
enjoy O
over O
here O

Nobody O
can O
take O
that O
away O
from O
us O

Democrats B-ORG
’ O
push O
to O
advance O
their O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
bill O
is O
likely O
headed O
for O
a O
procedural O
speed O
bump O
known O
in O
Washington B-LOC
as O
a O
“vote-a-rama O
.” O

The O
time-consuming O
and O
stamina-challenging O
process O
is O
among O
the O
final O
obstacles O
for O
Democrats B-ORG
, O
along O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian’s O
review O
of O
the O
package O
. O

Politically O
, O
a O
vote-a-rama O
gives O
Republicans B-ORG
a O
chance O
to O
sow O
discord O
and O
create O
distractions O
as O
they O
force O
Democrats B-ORG
to O
vote O
on O
controversial O
issues O
. O

But, O
once O
it’s O
over, O
Democrats B-ORG
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
advance O
their O
package O
on O
a O
straight O
party-line O
vote O
that O
would O
not O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
filibuster’s O
60-vote O
threshold. O

Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
: O
What O
is O
a O
vote-a-rama O
? O

Usually O
in O
the O
legislative O
process O
, O
lawmakers O
can O
use O
a O
series O
of O
procedural O
maneuvers O
to O
avoid O
voting O
on O
amendments O
. O

But O
in O
a O
budget O
reconciliation O
process O
– O
which O
Democrats B-ORG
are O
using O
to O
advance O
their O
bill O
– O
you O
can’t O
do O
that O

Lawmakers O
cannot O
hold O
a O
final O
vote O
on O
a O
reconciliation O
bill O
until O
all O
the O
amendments O
have O
been O
“disposed O
of,” O
or O
in O
simpler O
terms, O
“voted O
on.” O

The O
practice O
involves O
votes O
on O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
that O
can O
– O
and O
usually O
do O
– O
stretch O
for O
hours O

How O
do O
lawmakers O
use O
the O
process O
? O

The O
party O
in O
charge O
typically O
wants O
to O
move O
this O
vote-a-rama O
along O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
with O
as O
few O
votes O
as O
possible O

The O
minority O
party O
takes O
the O
opportunity O
to O
force O
votes O
on O
all O
kinds O
of O
measures O
they O
don’t O
typically O
have O
the O
power O
to O
put O
on O
the O
floor O

How O
long O
does O
each O
vote O
take O
? O

Usually O
, O
lawmakers O
agree O
to O
a O
process O
that O
looks O
a O
lot O
like O
this O
. O

Each O
amendment O
takes O
about O
15 O
minutes O
or O
so O
to O
get O
through O

The O
process O
moves O
quickly O
by O
Senate B-ORG
standards O
, O
which O
is O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
for O
members O
to O
basically O
stay O
in O
or O
close O
by O
the O
chamber O
for O
the O
entire O
marathon O
event O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill O
? O

The O
bill O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ O
goals O
, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years O
: O
Still O
, O
this O
isn’t O
Build O
Back O
Better O
2.0 O
. O

The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
key O
Democratic O
priorities O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
left O
out O
. O

Just O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
the O
four O
rockers O
were O
little-known O
musicians O
playing O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Rome B-LOC
and O
fighting O
other O
street O
performers O
for O
a O
spot O
on O
the O
corner O
that O
would O
attract O
the O
most O
people O
. O

Now, O
attracting O
a O
crowd O
is O
as O
simple O
as O
announcing O
their O
next O
concert. O

I O
picked O
it O
when O
we O
first O
started O
playing O
because O
we O
needed O
to O
join O
this O
musical O
competition O
, O
and O
we O
didn’t O
have O
a O
name O
yet O
, O
so O
they O
just O
told O
me O
just O
say O
random O
words O
in O
Danish O
, O
and O
we O
chose O
one O
. O

Looking O
back O
at O
this O
last O
year O
, O
I’m O
sure O
it’s O
been O
absolutely O
crazy O
for O
you O
, O
from O
where O
you O
were O
a O
year O
ago O
to O
now O
? O

Damiano B-PER
David I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
it’s O
been O
a O
crazy O
journey O
, O
but O
of O
course O
we O
are O
really O
happy O
about O
everything O
that O
we O
did O
, O
and O
every O
time O
we O
look O
back O
, O
all O
the O
steps O
, O
we O
are O
super O
happy O
and O
proud O

What O
has O
been O
the O
most O
surprising O
, O
maybe O
the O
most O
exciting O
thing O
, O
that O
has O
happened O
to O
you O
this O
past O
year O
? O

Raggi B-PER
: O
I O
think O
that O
we’ve O
had O
lots O
of O
incredible O
moments O
during O
this O
last O
year O

Maybe O
a O
song O
with O
Iggy B-PER
Pop I-PER
is O
one O
of O
these O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
playing O
with O
The B-ORG
Stones I-ORG
. O

I O
mean O
a O
lot O
, O
it’s O
been O
a O
lot O
. O

Now O
you’re O
filling O
stadiums O
with O
70,000 O
people O
, O
selling O
out O
tickets O
for O
80,000 O
, O
and O
you’ve O
said O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
for O
you O
guys O
to O
even O
find O
a O
place O
to O
play O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O

What O
was O
that O
like O
when O
you O
started O
? O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
It O
was O
very O
difficult O
because O
in O
Rome B-LOC
there’s O
no O
real O
rock O
scene O
, O
so O
there’s O
no O
like O
clubs O
wanting O
bands O
to O
play O
their O
stuff O
, O
and O
also O
people O
are O
not O
very O
used O
to O
going O
to O
gigs O
of O
upcoming O
artists O
. O

They O
just O
go O
to O
the O
famous O
ones O
that O
they O
already O
know O
, O
so O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
and O
that’s O
why O
we O
started O
playing O
as O
buskers O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

We O
were O
always O
fighting O
with O
the O
other O
street O
artists O
about O
having O
the O
best O
spot O
, O
and O
we O
never O
won O
, O
but O
… O
(laughter) O

And O
then O
you O
do O
Eurovision O
, O
how O
did O
it O
change O
your O
life O
? O

David B-PER
I O
think O
that O
was O
our O
first O
actual O
window O
outside O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O

Since O
that O
moment O
we O
were O
only O
basing O
our O
projects O
for O
Italy B-LOC
and O
on O
Italy B-LOC
and O
that O
was O
the O
chance O
to O
break O
out O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
then O
from O
Europe B-LOC
to O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
and O
we O
hope O
to O
grow O
more O
and O
more O

What O
was O
it O
like O
to O
win O
for O
Italy B-LOC
? O

It O
had O
been O
like O
30 O
years O
since O
Italy B-LOC
had O
won O
Eurovision O
, O
and O
then O
you O
win O
with O
rock O
n’ O
roll O
, O
a O
genre O
which O
is O
not O
very O
big O
there O
? O

Raggi B-PER
: O
Yes O
, O
that’s O
crazy O
. O

David B-PER
: O
That O
was O
unexpected O
I O
think O
for O
everybody O
. O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
everyone O
was O
very O
proud O
, O
big O
celebration O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
times O
for O
Eurovision B-ORG
winners O
, O
they O
have O
that O
big O
moment O
and O
then O
they O
kind O
of O
disappear O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
makes O
you O
guys O
different O
that O
you’ve O
been O
able O
to O
take O
this O
and O
catapult O
so O
much O
and O
become O
this O
worldwide O
phenomenon O
? O

David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
for O
us O
Eurovision O
came O
at O
a O
very O
right O
moment O
because O
we O
had O
just O
come O
out O
with O
an O
album O
, O
so O
what O
we O
brought O
to O
Eurovision O
was O
basically O
just O
one O
of O
the O
things O
of O
the O
whole O
album O
and O
it O
was O
fresh O
, O
and O
it O
was O
super O
authentic O
for O
us O
. O

So, O
I O
think O
that O
people O
were O
happy O
to O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
coherence O
between O
what O
we O
brought O
to O
Eurovision O
and O
what O
they O
saw O
in O
our O
catalogue, O
and O
they O
felt O
like, O
OK, O
this O
is O
not O
just O
a O
viral O
song O
that O
they O
made O
specifically O
for O
Eurovision, O
but O
it’s O
just O
one O
of O
their O
songs O
and O
then O
they O
have O
two O
albums, O
and O
it O
all O
makes O
sense. O

Then O
, O
you O
release O
“Beggin,’ O
” O
which O
turns O
into O
the O
most O
successful O
rock O
song O
of O
last O
year O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
woke O
up O
every O
morning O
I O
think O
for O
the O
last O
year O
like O
, O
(sings) O
, O
“I’m O
beggin’ O
, O
beggin’ O
you O
”… O
(laughter) O
… O
It O
just O
gets O
in O
my O
head O
, O
and O
then O
I’m O
like O
, O
come O
on O
, O
just O
get O
out O
! O

David B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
it’s O
our O
fault O
, O
it’s O
our O
fault O
, O
(laughter) O
. O

Well, O
it’s O
not O
even O
our O
fault O
because O
we O
didn’t O
even O
promote O
it. O

It’s O
TikTok’s B-ORG
fault. O

It O
just O
got O
viral O

We O
were O
pretty O
shocked O
by O
it O

When O
we O
saw O
it O
growing O
, O
we O
were O
like O
, O
what O
is O
happening O
, O
and O
then O
we O
found O
out O
it O
was O
viral O
on O
TikTok B-ORG
and O
all O
that O
came O
about O
after O

Why O
that O
song O
? O

It’s O
a O
cover O
of O
Frankie B-PER
Valli I-PER
and O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
, O
and O
I O
can’t O
think O
of O
a O
more O
different O
style O
than O
you O
guys O
and O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
. O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Actually O
, O
we O
played O
it O
at O
first O
, O
when O
we O
just O
started O
, O
and O
we O
think O
it’s O
way O
more O
challenging O
and O
fun O
to O
make O
covers O
of O
very O
different O
songs O
. O

So, O
like O
now O
we’re O
also O
playing O
“Womanizer” O
by O
Britney B-PER
Spears, I-PER
for O
example, O
and O
we O
just O
find O
it O
a O
challenge O
and O
stimulating, O
and O
it O
really O
makes O
you O
do O
an O
interpretation O
of O
something O
different O
and O
bringing O
it O
into O
your O
own. O

That’s O
when O
you O
make O
something O
good O
, O
I O
think O
. O

You O
also O
covered O
“If O
I O
Can O
Dream” O
for O
the O
Elvis B-PER
movie, O
what O
was O
it O
like O
singing O
an O
Elvis B-PER
song? O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
know O
, O
“ O
The O
King O
of O
Rock O
n’ O
Roll O
.” O

David B-PER
: O
Well O
, O
every O
time O
when O
we O
have O
some O
big O
deals O
, O
we O
try O
not O
to O
think O
about O
it O
that O
much O
because O
then O
you O
get O
like O
anxious O
, O
and O
you O
feel O
the O
pressure O
. O

When O
we O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
play O
a O
cover O
of O
Elvis B-PER
, O
we O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
we O
were O
confronting O
Elvis B-PER
because O
that O
would O
have O
been O
impossible O
, O
you O
cannot O
try O
to O
fight O
with O
Elvis’ B-PER
heritage O
. O

We O
were O
just O
super O
happy O
and O
super O
glad O
and O
super O
honored O
just O
to O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
play O
one O
of O
his O
songs O
, O
and O
we O
focused O
on O
that O
, O
and O
we O
focused O
on O
doing O
the O
best O
that O
we O
could O
do O
on O
that O
song O
without O
even O
comparing O
it O
with O
the B-PER
Elvis I-PER
one O
because O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it’s O
untouchable O
. O

Now O
you O
have O
two O
VMA O
nominations O
and O
a O
third O
number O
one O
song O
on O
the O
Billboard B-ORG
charts O
, O
“Supermodel,” O
can O
you O
tell O
me O
what O
the O
song O
is O
about O
? O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
The O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
it’s O
about O
supermodels O
, O
but O
it’s O
not O

We O
wrote O
it O
after O
being O
like O
three O
months O
in O
L.A. O
where O
we O
met O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
were O
faking O
being O
supermodels O
or O
superstars O

Everyone O
was O
very O
focused O
on O
the O
way O
they O
appeared O
and O
not O
what O
they’re O
really O
like O
or O
who O
they O
really O
were O

Everyone O
was O
just O
trying O
to O
fake O
that O
they O
have O
the O
best O
clothes O
, O
best O
friends O
, O
best O
club O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
and O
we O
found O
it O
a O
bit O
stupid O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
that O
we O
thought O
was O
only O
shown O
in O
movies O
, O
like O
a O
stereotype O
, O
you O
know O
, O
but O
when O
we O
saw O
it O
in O
person O
, O
we O
just O
thought O
it O
was O
fun O
and O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
funny O
song O
about O
it O
. O

make O

song O
about O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC

about O
? O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Ohhh O

(laughs) O
… O
we O
need O
to O

more O
months O

David B-PER
: O

think O
it O
would O
be O
like O
a O
club O
song O
, O
super O
dirty O
, O
clubbish O
… O
(laughter) O
. O

You’ve O
played O
different O
festivals O

like O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
but O
this O
weekend O
you O
are O
doing O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
in O
Chicago B-LOC
. O

What O
does O
it O
mean O
to O
play O
at O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
here O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
? O

Raggi B-PER

huge O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
It’s O
our O
first O
Festival O

So, O

like O
a O
big, O
big O
thing O

David: B-PER

not O
our O
first O
festival! O

We O
played O
at O
Coachella B-LOC
, O

( O

Laughter O
) O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
Whoops O
, O
that’s O
true O
, O
Coachella B-LOC
. O

We O
started O
this O
festival O
season O
this O
summer O
, O
and O
it’s O
only O
been O
Europe B-LOC
until O
now O
, O
so O
for O
this O
summer O
it’s O
the O
first O
. O

Raggi B-PER
: O
For O
the O
summer O
, O
yes O
. O

You O
sing O
in O
English O
and O
Italian O
, O
but O
we O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
Italian O
singers O
who O
are O
huge O
in O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
and O
they O
sing O
in O
Spanish O
– O
Laura B-PER
Pausini I-PER
, O
Eros B-PER
Ramazzotti I-PER
, O
Il B-PER
Volo I-PER
– O
do O
you O
think O
you O
would O
ever O
sing O
in O
Spanish O
? O

David B-PER
: O
Why O
not O
? O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
In O
Spanish O
? O

David B-PER
: O
I O
basically O
mostly O
listen O
to O
Spanish O
sounding O
music O
, O
so O
I O
would O
not O
back O
up O
… O
(laughs) O

You’re O
going O
to O
launch O
your O
tour O
, O
and O
you’re O
going O
to O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
Santiago B-LOC
, O
Buenos B-LOC
Aires I-LOC
. O

What’s O
it O
like O
going O
to O
all O
these O
places O
, O
is O
it O
a O
culture O
shock O
when O
you O
go O
: O

David B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we O
have O
never O
been O
, O
outside O
of O
Ethan B-PER
, O
we’ve O
never O
been O
to O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
, O
and O
we O
never O
played O
there O
, O
but O
of O
course O
, O
we O
know O
something O
about O
the O
people O
there O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
they’re O
really O
crazy O
… O
(laughter) O
… O
hyped O
up O
, O
heated O
up O
, O
and O
we O
like O
these O
kinds O
of O
crowds O
. O

So, O
we O
can’t O
wait O
to O
play O
there, O
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
amazed O
me O
the O
most. O

When O
I O
saw O
the O
tickets O
that O
were O
selling O
, O
it O
was O
like O
“ O
what O
the O
f**k O
?” O

how O
did O
we O
get O
there O
? O

It O
was O
crazy O
, O
so O
we O
really O
can’t O
wait O
to O
be O
there O
. O

How O
has O
fame O
changed O
you O
, O
if O
at O
all O
? O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
I O
don’t O
think O
it O
has O
changed O
us O

David B-PER
: O
I’m O
less O
worried O
about O
things O
, O
actually O
. O

I O
guess O
I’m O
stable O
… O
(laughs) O
. O

Do O
you O
feel O
that O
fame O
, O
when O
you’re O
this O
well-known O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
responsibility O
to O
speak O
out O
on O
certain O
political O
issues O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
artists O
say O
, O
I’m O
an O
entertainer O
, O
not O
a O
politician O
or O
an O
activist O
. O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
for O
us O
, O
I O
think O
it O
comes O
naturally O
, O
so O
when O
we O
think O
we O
know O
enough O
about O
a O
topic O
, O
and O
we O
think O
our O
opinion O
can O
, O
like O
, O
make O
the O
difference O
or O
something O
we O
don’t O
feel O
it O
like O
as O
a O
pressure O
or O
something O
. O

It O
just O
comes O
naturally O
, O
and O
we’re O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
we O
can O
share O
a O
positive O
message O
on O
something O
that O
really O
matters O
to O
us O
, O
we’re O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O

If O
not O
, O
we O
also O
don’t O
feel O
the O
pressure O
to O
have O
to O
do O
it O
. O

You O
did O
a O
song O
in O
support O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
“We’re O
Gonna O
Dance O
on O
Gasoline O
,” O
how O
do O
you O
feel O
about O
that O
situation O
? O

David B-PER
: O
It’s O
really O
hard O
to O
say O
that O
because O
we O
feel O
very O
bad O
about O
it O
, O
but O
we O
also O
know O
that O
we O
have O
a O
huge O
privilege O
, O
with O
no O
worries O
, O
we’re O
not O
worried O
that O
something O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
us O
. O

So, O
we O
are O
privileged, O
but O
of O
course, O
if O
we O
can O
spread O
knowledge O
about O
it, O
we O
are O
more O
than O
happy, O
and O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
because O
that’s O
something O
that O
is O
happening O
today O
and O
if O
we O
can O
do O
something O
today, O
it’s O
more O
valuable. O

One O
of O
your O
first O
songs O
was O
“Zitti O
E O
Buoni,” O
which O
means O
“Shut O
Up O
and O
Behave.” O

It O
doesn’t O
seem O
like O
you O
guys O
are O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
any O
shutting O
up O
or O
behaving O
any O
time O
soon O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
No O
, O
not O
at O
all O
. O

Where O
do O
you O
go O
from O
here O
? O

De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
I O
don’t O
know O
, O
we O
feel O
very O
free O
. O

We O
just O
want O
to O
keep O
playing O

We O
have O
so O
many O
amazing O
gigs O
and O
tours O
coming O
in O
front O
of O
us O
, O
so O
I O
think O
we’re O
really O
going O
to O
enjoy O
it O
and O
get O
all O
the O
possible O
inspiration O
from O
that O
and O
then O
turn O
it O
into O
music O
. O

We O
don’t O
want O
to O
set O
any O
specific O
goals O
, O
but O
we O
just O
want O
to O
go O
on O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
and O
keep O
getting O
better O
and O
doing O
what O
we O
feel O
is O
right O

this O
report O

When O
a O
bipartisan O
group O
of O
lawmakers O
visited O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
border O
in O
March O
, O
an O
unexpected O
guest O
showed O
up O
on O
the O
trip O
: O
GOP O
Rep. O
Victoria B-PER
Spartz I-PER
of O
Indiana B-LOC
. O

Spartz B-PER
, O
the O
first O
Ukrainian-born O
member O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
Congress I-ORG
and O
an O
outspoken O
advocate O
for O
her O
home O
country O
, O
had O
expressed O
interest O
in O
joining O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
but O
wasn’t O
invited O
to O
attend O
the O
trip O
, O
which O
consisted O
primarily O
of O
House B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
members O
, O
a O
panel O
where O
Spartz B-PER
is O
not O
a O
member O
. O

So, O
she O
used O
her O
own O
funds O
to O
fly O
to O
the O
border O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
linked O
up O
with O
lawmakers O
once O
there O
to O
join O
in O
on O
some O
of O
their O
meetings, O
according O
to O
multiple O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
situation. O

Her O
surprise O
appearance O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
which O
have O
not O
been O
previously O
reported O
, O
was O
initially O
viewed O
as O
a O
welcome O
addition O
– O
albeit O
an O
unusual O
one O
– O
as O
lawmakers O
sought O
to O
rally O
Western B-LOC
support O
for O
Ukraine B-LOC
amid O
Russia’s B-LOC
bloody O
assault O
on O
the O
country O
that O
began O
a O
week O
earlier O
. O

But O
members O
who O
were O
part O
of O
the O
official O
trip O
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
Spartz O
was O
“argumentative,” O
“accusatory,” O
and O
“unhelpful” O
during O
key O
meetings O
with O
NATO B-ORG
members O
, O
generals O
and O
government O
officials O
, O
sparking O
concern O
that O
her O
presence O
was O
doing O
more O
harm O
than O
good O
. O

She O
crashed O
our O
CoDel O

She O
was O
like O
a O
bull O
in O
a O
china O
shop,” O
said O
one O
GOP B-ORG
lawmaker, O
who O
like O
other O
members O
for O
this O
story O
was O
granted O
anonymity O
to O
speak O
more O
freely O
about O
a O
colleague O
and O
due O
to O
the O
sensitive O
nature O
of O
the O
subject. O

I O
don’t O
know O
if O
it O
was O
pent-up O
frustration O
or O
she O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
she O
was O
getting O
enough O
proper O
information O
, O
but O
she O
was O
just O
accusatory O
and O
rude O
. O

Spartz B-PER
, O
in O
an O
email O
to O
CNN B-ORG
, O
pushed O
back O
on O
the O
anonymous O
criticism O
of O
her O
decision O
to O
elbow O
her O
way O
into O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
and O
refuted O
the O
description O
of O
her O
behavior O
on O
the O
trip O
. O

This O
accusation O
is O
a O
cowardly O
misrepresentation O
of O
facts O
by O
some O
jealous O
members O
or O
staff O
since O
we O
had O
a O
very O
productive O
bipartisan O
CODEL O
in O
March B-LOC
,” O
Spartz B-PER
said O
. O

I O
did O
not O
come O
to O
Congress B-ORG
to O
get O
paid O
for O
my O
travel O
vacations O
or O
dinners O
, O
but O
rather O
get O
things O
done O
. O

I O
have O
always O
been O
willing O
to O
spend O
my O
own O
hard-earned O
money O
to O
help O
with O
causes O
I O
care O
about O
. O

That O
bipartisan O
frustration O
over O
Spartz’s O
behavior O
was O
only O
the O
beginning O

In O
the O
nearly O
six O
months O
since O
the O
war O
began O
, O
Spartz B-PER
has O
publicly O
criticized O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
government O
, O
peddled O
corruption O
allegations O
against O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
government O
and O
some O
of O
Ukrainian B-LOC
President O
Volodymyr B-PER
Zelensky’s I-PER
top O
aides O
, O
and O
spurred O
complaints O
from O
her O
colleagues O
that O
she O
is O
mirroring O
pro-Russia O
talking O
points O
. O

“ O
President O
Zelensky B-PER
has O
to O
stop O
playing O
politics O
and O
theater O
, O
and O
start O
governing O
to O
better O
support O
his O
military O
and O
local O
governments O
, O
” O
Spartz B-PER
said O
in O
a O
press O
release O
last O
month O
, O
in O
one O
example O
of O
her O
outspoken O
criticisms O
of O
Kyiv B-LOC
. O

Spartz B-PER
, O
a O
43-year-old O
businesswoman O
, O
has O
repeatedly O
insisted O
, O
publicly O
and O
privately O
, O
that O
she O
wants O
Ukraine B-LOC
to O
win O
, O
and O
that O
she O
is O
only O
attacking O
Kyiv B-LOC
because O
she O
wants O
to O
help O
remove O
any O
potential O
obstacles O
to O
a O
Ukrainian O
victory O
over O
Russia B-LOC
. O

She O
says O
she O
has O
visited O
Ukraine B-LOC
six O
times O
since O
the O
invasion O
began O
and O
has O
also O
slammed O
Russia B-LOC
consistently O
, O
including O
as O
recently O
as O
Tuesday O
when O
she O
tweeted O
that O
Russia B-LOC
should O
be O
declared O
a O
terrorist O
state O
. O

Still O
, O
Spartz B-PER
’s O
bellicose O
rhetoric O
aimed O
at O
Zelensky B-PER
and O
his O
advisers O
has O
frustrated O
lawmakers O
in O
both O
parties O
, O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
and O
members O
of O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
parliament O
alike O
. O

They O
worry O
she O
is O
undermining O
their O
efforts O
to O
stay O
united O
behind O
Ukraine B-LOC
at O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
and O
openly O
question O
where O
she O
is O
getting O
some O
of O
her O
information O
, O
according O
to O
interviews O
with O
over O
a O
dozen O
lawmakers O
, O
aides O
and O
administration O
sources O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
multiple O
briefings O
from O
the O
Biden B-ORG
administration I-ORG
and O
private O
pleas O
from O
senior O
Republicans B-ORG
have O
done O
little O
to O
rein O
in O
Spartz’s O
vocal O
criticism O
, O
sources O
said O
. O

Once O
seen O
as O
a O
crucial O
messaging O
asset O
, O
Spartz O
has O
now O
become O
something O
of O
a O
liability O
for O
defense O
hawks O
who O
were O
already O
worried O
about O
fatigue O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
over O
the O
ongoing O
war O
abroad O
. O

And O
her O
continued O
criticism O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
also O
comes O
amid O
growing O
skepticism O
from O
the O
MAGA B-ORG
wing O
of O
the O
GOP B-ORG
about O
keeping O
weapons O
and O
aid O
flowing O
to O
the O
country O
. O

Because O
she’s O
the O
only O
Ukrainian-born O
member O
of O
Congress O
, O
she O
has O
outsize O
megaphone O
, O
outsize O
influence O
, O
Rep. O
Elissa B-PER
Slotkin I-PER
, O
a O
Michigan B-LOC
Democrat O
and O
former O
CIA B-ORG
analyst O
, O
said O
to O
CNN B-ORG
. O

I O
think O
there’s O
an O
open O
question O
of O
why O
she’s O
so O
openly O
saying O
something O
that’s O
so O
clearly O
aligned O
with O
Russian B-LOC
talking O
points O
. O

Spartz O
contends O
she O
has O
long O
been O
concerned O
about O
corruption O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC

But O
lawmakers O
fear O
her O
public O
criticism O
could O
undermine O
confidence O
in O
Zelensky B-PER
, O
damage O
relations O
between O
the O
.U. B-LOC
S. I-LOC
and O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
and O
give O
on-the-fence O
lawmakers O
a O
reason O
to O
oppose O
the O
next O
aid O
package O
. O

Some O
lawmakers O
– O
even O
those O
unhappy O
with O
her O
rhetoric O
– O
came O
to O
Spartz’s B-PER
defense O
, O
arguing O
she O
is O
well-intentioned O
and O
just O
desperate O
to O
help O
her O
motherland O
as O
it’s O
being O
ripped O
apart O
by O
war O
. O

Spartz O
was O
a O
vocal O
champion O
of O
key O
legislation O
to O
speed O
up O
the O
administration’s O
ability O
to O
send O
weaponry O
and O
other O
critical O
resources O
to O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
attending O
the O
bill O
signing O
ceremony O
with O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
. O

And O
lawmakers O
in O
both O
parties O
have O
shared O
in O
her O
calls O
for O
more O
rigorous O
oversight O
of O
the O
weapons O
heading O
into O
Ukraine B-LOC

She O
was O
overcome O
with O
emotion O

And O
I O
think O
what O
you’re O
seeing O
now O
is O
a O
manifestation O
of O
that O
,” O
said O
a O
second O
GOP B-ORG
lawmaker O
. O
“ O

What O
I’m O
trying O
to O
tell O
her O
is O
, O
I’m O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
corruption O
problem O
. O
… O

But O
talking O
about O
corruption O
now O
when O
they O
are O
under O
siege O
, O
is O
like O
wall-papering O
your O
bathroom O
when O
the O
house O
is O
burning O
down O
around O
you O
. O

It’s O
counterproductive O

Spartz B-PER
said O
in O
an O
email O
to O
CNN B-ORG
that O
she O
is O
just O
seeking O
accountability O
and O
always O
gets O
her O
information O
“from O
the O
ground O
and O
real O
professionals O
, O
not O
from O
academics O
and O
political O
hacks O
who’ve O
never O
set O
foot O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

And O
Spartz B-PER
said O
it O
was O
the O
“foreign O
policy O
establishment” O
– O
not O
her O
– O
who O
was O
playing O
into O
Russian B-LOC
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin’s I-PER
hands. O

I O
also O
care O
deeply O
about O
people’s O
lives O

the O

either O
refuted O

The O

was O

When O
they O
met O
, O
she O
again O
raised O
concerns O
about O
corruption O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC

alleged O
that O
US-provided O

not O
going O

Milley O
did O
not O
dismiss O

corruption O
continues O
to O
be O
a O
problem O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC

In O
a O

, O
National O
Security O

Jake B-PER

Broadly O

Milley B-PER
explained O
to O

that O
her O
concerns O
were O
overwrought O

the O

explained O

Spartz B-PER
told O

that O
her O

Milley B-PER
“ O

that O
“ O

I O
believe O
he O
understands O
the O

of O

the O

are O
making O

, O
not O
military O
leaders O
, O
” O
she O
said O

This O
should O
trouble O
all O

Several O

her O
public O

But O
he O
did O
credit O

in O
the O
early O

an O
emotional O

There O
is O
also O
concern O
about O
Spartz B-PER

behavior O

Slotkin B-PER

Spartz B-PER
came O
up O
in O
multiple O
meetings O

dinners O
when O
she O
was O
recently O
in O
Kyiv B-LOC
and O
that O
last O

she O
received O
a O
text O
message O
from O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
parliament O
saying O
they O
don’t O
know O
if O
Spartz B-PER

being O
“played” O
but O
“she O
has O
ruined O
her O
reputation O

All O
the O
senior O

They’re O
upset O
about O
it O
,” O
Slotkin B-PER
said O
.” O

They O
don’t O
understand O
why O
she’s O
doing O
this O
. O

Ukrainian O
officials O
have O
become O
increasingly O
alarmed O
by O
Spartz’s O
rhetoric O
over O
the O
last O
several O
months O

Ukrainian O
sources O
told O

, O
particularly O
her O
persistent O
attacks O
on O
Zelensky’s O
powerful O
chief O
of O

Andriy B-PER
Yermak I-PER
. O

In O
tweets O
last O
month O
, O
she O
accused O
Yermak B-PER
of O
“undemocratic O
governance” O
and O
said O
he O
had O
a O
“negative O
reputation” O
globally O

And O
on O
July O
8 O
, O
Spartz B-PER
sent O
a O
letter O
to O

a O
briefing O
specifically O
about O
Yermak B-PER
“ O
and O
his O
alleged O

Spartz’s O
accusations O
are O
similar O
to O
those O
reported O
by O
Radio B-ORG
Free I-ORG
Europe I-ORG
before O
the O
war O
, O
which O
alleged O
Yermak B-PER
had O
business O
ties O
to O
Russia B-LOC

That O
allegation O
has O
been O
used O
by O
Zelensky’s B-PER
critics O
to O
suggest O
Yermak B-PER
might O
be O
too O
willing O
to O
bend O
to O
Kremlin B-LOC
demands O
, O
particularly O
following O
a O
controversial O
prisoner O
swap O
deal O
in O
2021 O

There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
he O
is O
under O
the O
Kremlin’s B-LOC

however O
, O
and O
he O
has O
denied O
the O

Ukrainian O

questioned O
Spartz’s O
motivations O

In O
text O
messages O
to O
a O
Zelensky B-PER
aide O
on O
June O
24 O
, O
Spartz B-PER
offered O
to O
“connect” O
the O

“with O
the O
right O
people” O
who O
she O
said O

you O

maybe O

Spartz O
asked O

to O
Ukrainian O
Defense O

Oleksii B-PER
Reznikov I-PER

Some O
of O
them O

we O
will O
have O

keep O
these O

his O
son O
said O
that O
an O
increased O
number O

make O

he O
believes O

As O
of O
right O
now O
, O
we O
’ll O
just O
continue O

see O
if O
somehow O
we O
can O
change O
the O
perception O
of O
the O

the O

US B-LOC
, O
predominantly O
among O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
, O
the O
stigma O
associated O
with O
it O
has O
also O
grown O
– O
including O
in O
the O
medical O
community O
. O

A O
recent O
CNN B-ORG
investigation O
found O
that O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
rising O
case O
numbers O
, O
some O
phlebotomists O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
have O
refused O
to O
draw O
blood O
from O
patients O
with O
suspected O
monkeypox O
, O
preventing O
these O
patients O
from O
obtaining O
medically O
necessary O
and O
physician-ordered O
tests O
. O

Yet O
the O
definition O
of O
“suspected O
monkeypox” O
and O
the O
other O
details O
around O
these O
cases O
remain O
murky O
at O
best. O

As O
CNN B-ORG
noted O
in O
its O
reporting O
, O
it O
is O
unclear O
if O
the O
phlebotomists O
refused O
to O
perform O
blood O
draws O
, O
or O
whether O
company O
policy O
prohibited O
it O
. O

Are O
these O
encounters O
in O
which O
gay O
men O
are O
being O
denied O
bloodwork O
simply O
because O
they O
are O
gay O
and O
monkeypox O
is O
now O
associated O
with O
this O
demographic O
? O

Or O
are O
these O
situations O
in O
which O
patients O
with O
visible O
and O
infectious O
pustules O
are O
presenting O
to O
diagnostic O
testing O
sites O
where O
phlebotomists O
are O
worried O
about O
whether O
proper O
safety O
policies O
and O
procedures O
are O
in O
place O
? O

In O
the O
first O
encounter O
, O
homophobia O
is O
the O
driving O
factor O
; O
in O
the O
second O
, O
any O
reasonable O
health O
care O
provider O
would O
similarly O
have O
reservations O
about O
putting O
themselves O
at O
risk O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
US B-ORG
Centers I-ORG
for I-ORG
Disease I-ORG
Control I-ORG
and I-ORG
Prevention I-ORG
suggests O
that O
virus O
levels O
in O
infected O
people’s O
blood O
are O
low O
, O
non-bloodborne O
transmission O
routes O
such O
as O
directly O
touching O
lesions O
may O
increase O
a O
health O
care O
worker’s O
possible O
risk O
of O
getting O
infected O
without O
adequate O
PPE O
. O

We O
are O
gay O
men O
, O
and O
seeing O
those O
in O
our O
community O
denied O
medical O
care O
echoes O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
HIV/AIDS O
epidemic O
. O

Originally O
called O
GRID O
( O
gay O
related O
immunodeficiency O
) O
, O
the O
outbreak O
resulted O
in O
discrimination O
and O
stigmatization O
of O
LGBTQ+ O
individuals O
across O
society O
regardless O
of O
infectious O
status O
. O

It O
is O
discriminatory O
to O
assume O
that O
an O
identity O
is O
itself O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
disease O
and O
that O
avoidance O
of O
complete O
segments O
of O
society O
is O
an O
appropriate O
safety O
mechanism O

Yet O
these O
faulty O
assumptions O
remain O
the O
cornerstone O
of O
homophobia O
in O
modern O
day O
medicine O
and O
account O
for O
much O
of O
the O
mistrust O
that O
LGBTQ+ O
people O
have O
toward O
the O
health O
care O
system O

But O
as O
medical O
professionals O
, O
we O
also O
understand O
the O
fear O
that O
comes O
with O
encountering O
patients O
who O
have O
highly O
infectious O
diseases O
. O

Eric O
has O
been O
a O
frontline O
physician O
since O
day O
one O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
and O
is O
now O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
patients O
with O
monkeypox O

Tom O
has O
worked O
with O
patients O
in O
the O
intensive O
care O
unit O
during O
the O
Delta O
Covid-19 O
surge O

We O
understand O
the O
real O
fear O
of O
contracting O
viruses O
at O
work O
, O
and O
– O
as O
a O
married O
couple O
– O
we O
recognize O
the O
concern O
about O
bringing O
disease O
home O
to O
loved O
ones O
. O

With O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
, O
we O
watched O
as O
guidelines O
on O
PPE O
changed O
out O
of O
convenience O
rather O
than O
out O
of O
scientific O
data O
and O
saw O
our O
coworkers O
– O
fellow O
doctors O
, O
nurses O
, O
phlebotomists O
, O
radiology O
technicians O
, O
janitorial O
staff O
, O
security O
– O
contract O
the O
virus O
from O
their O
patients O
. O

No O
one O
goes O
into O
medicine O
to O
hurt O
patients O
– O
everyone O
in O
health O
care O
has O
decided O
to O
work O
in O
an O
industry O
that O
tries O
to O
improve O
the O
lives O
of O
others O
. O

Yet, O
it O
would O
be O
unconscionable O
to O
expect O
everyone O
in O
health O
care O
to O
put O
their O
own O
health O
at O
risk O
to O
help O
their O
patients. O

And O
coming O
off O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
experience O
, O
there O
is O
justified O
mistrust O
and O
persistent O
fear O
among O
many O
health O
care O
personnel O
. O

The O
way O
to O
ameliorate O
the O
situation O
at O
large O
– O
both O
to O
bolster O
the O
health O
and O
safety O
of O
health O
care O
workers O
and O
to O
address O
the O
stigmas O
associated O
with O
monkeypox O
– O
is O
twofold O
: O
education O
and O
proper O
safety O
policies O
including O
the O
provision O
of O
personal O
protective O
equipment O

Health O
care O
providers O
at O
all O
levels O
must O
be O
included O
in O
trainings O
about O
what O
monkeypox O
is O
, O
how O
it O
is O
spread O
( O
and O
how O
it O
isn’t O
) O
and O
mechanisms O
to O
keep O
themselves O
safe O
while O
caring O
for O
all O
patients O
– O
both O
those O
with O
monkeypox O
and O
those O
without O

We O
must O
make O
it O
clear O
what O
safety O
procedures O
are O
necessary O
and O
ensure O
all O
providers O
have O
access O
to O
materials O
like O
PPE O
at O
all O
times O

We O
must O
allow O
each O
health O
care O
worker O
the O
chance O
to O
ask O
questions O
about O
how O
monkeypox O
impacts O
their O
job O

As O
a O
medical O
community O
, O
we O
will O
more O
than O
likely O
identify O
lapses O
in O
our O
policies O
and O
ways O
to O
improve O
them O
. O

Feeling O
protected O
is O
a O
key O
motivator O
for O
behavior O
change O

We’ve O
seen O
the O
evolution O
in O
how O
we’ve O
interacted O
with O
treated O
and O
dealt O
with O
HIV O
through O
the O
rise O
of O
universal O
precautions O
, O
aimed O
to O
protect O
health O
care O
workers O
. O

These O
precautions O
were O
introduced O
by O
the O
CDC B-ORG
in O
the O
1980s O
in O
response O
to O
the O
HIV O
epidemic O
when O
a O
lot O
was O
unknown O
about O
the O
virus O
, O
and O
they O
include O
protocols O
for O
hand O
hygiene O
; O
wearing O
gloves O
, O
goggles O
and O
gowns O
; O
and O
specific O
transmission-route O
based O
precautions O
. O

If O
followed O
properly O
, O
they O
can O
prevent O
the O
transmission O
of O
bloodborne O
pathogens O
and O
other O
infectious O
materials O
. O

The O
availability O
of O
pre-exposure O
prophylaxis O
, O
post-exposure O
prophylaxis O
and O
HIV O
treatment O
have O
even O
further O
decreased O
the O
fear O
around O
infection O
with O
HIV O
among O
health O
care O
providers O

Additionally O
, O
vaccines O
to O
prevent O
monkeypox O
, O
like O
Jynneos B-ORG
, O
are O
hard O
to O
find O
and O
must O
first O
go O
to O
patients O
at O
highest O
risk O
of O
disease O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
advises O
people O
who O
are O
exposed O
to O
monkeypox O
through O
their O
jobs O
, O
such O
as O
clinical O
laboratory O
personnel O
who O
perform O
diagnostic O
tests O
, O
to O
get O
the O
vaccine O
as O
a O
pre-exposure O
prophylaxis O
, O
and O
some O
health O
care O
workers O
who O
were O
exposed O
to O
patients O
with O
monkeypox O
have O
gotten O
the O
vaccine O
as O
a O
post-exposure O
prophylaxis O
to O
prevent O
illness O
or O
mitigate O
symptoms O
. O

But O
supplies O
are O
still O
low O
, O
and O
once O
the O
vaccines O
are O
more O
readily O
available O
, O
they O
should O
be O
offered O
as O
a O
pre-exposure O
prophylaxis O
to O
a O
broader O
range O
of O
health O
care O
workers O
, O
from O
nurses O
to O
hospital O
staff O
to O
technicians O
– O
all O
of O
whom O
may O
encounter O
patients O
with O
monkeypox O
. O

Labcorp B-ORG
executive O
Dr. O
Brian B-PER
Caveney I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
last O
week O
that O
some O
of O
their O
phlebotomists O
“have O
been O
scared” O
of O
monkeypox. O

Without O
specific O
information O
on O
what O
exactly O
is O
driving O
these O
phlebotomists O
to O
refuse O
blood O
draws O
, O
shaming O
health O
care O
workers O
for O
being O
afraid O
( O
despite O
potentially O
lacking O
PPE O
and O
updated O
information O
on O
monkeypox O
) O
or O
assuming O
that O
it O
stems O
exclusively O
from O
homophobia O
, O
feels O
a O
little O
myopic O
. O

As O
case O
numbers O
are O
projected O
to O
climb O
and O
the O
future O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
outbreak O
remains O
uncertain O
, O
careful O
messaging O
, O
knowledge O
sharing O
and O
destigmatizing O
should O
be O
our O
collective O
priority O
. O

Health O
care O
workers O
must O
feel O
heard O
and O
protected O
, O
as O
many O
of O
us O
are O
exhausted O
, O
fearful O
and O
burnt O
out O
from O
working O
nonstop O
through O
more O
than O
two O
years O
of O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
. O

But O
that O
cannot O
mean O
we O
overlook O
the O
needs O
of O
our O
gay O
, O
bisexual O
, O
queer O
and O
transgender O
patients O
– O
an O
already O
stigmatized O
group O
jaded O
from O
decades O
of O
minority O
stress O
. O

Institutional O
and O
public O
health O
strategies O
must O
make O
everyone O
– O
patients O
and O
providers O
alike O
– O
feel O
safe O
and O
welcome O

alternate O

as O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
, O
the O

of O

, O
is O
learning O
in O
a O
Texas B-LOC

where O
he O
’ O

being O
confronted O
with O
his O
lies O
about O

Not O
only O
did O
the O

order O
him O
to O
pay O
$4 O
million O
in O
compensatory O
damages O
on O
Thursday O
for O
pushing O
a O
conspiracy O
theory O
about O
the O
2012 O
Sandy B-LOC

perhaps O
to O
fact-check O
Jones B-PER

brag O
that O

It O
is O
his O
most O
loathsome O
lie O
, O
about O
Sandy B-PER
Hook I-PER
, O
for O
which O
Jones B-PER
will O
first O
have O
to O
pay O
. O

The O
jury O

is O
less O
than O
the O
$150 O
million O
originally O
sought O
by O
the O
parents O
of O
a O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC
victim O
, O
but O
Jones B-PER
could O
be O
ordered O
to O
pay O
more O
as O
part O
of O
a O
punitive O
portion O
of O
the O
proceedings O
and O
also O
potentially O
in O
two O

brought O
by O
different O
Sandy B-LOC

– O
which O
killed O
26 O
people O
, O

20 O

– O
was O
a O

that O

it O

but O
only O
now O
that O
his O

And O
yet O
, O
filmmakers O
keep O
trying O

There O
are O
the O
modern O
retellings O
– O
“Clueless,” O

dropped O

Emma B-PER

her O

this O
summer’s O
“Fire O

a O
version O
of O
“Pride O

with O
gay O
protagonists. O

There O
are O
those O
that O
stick O
closely O
to O
the O
text O
, O
like O
Whit B-PER
Stillman I-PER
’s O
uproarious O
“Love O

and O
the O
1995 O
“Pride O

miniseries O
that O
turned O
a O
generation O
of O
viewers O
into O
Colin B-PER
Firth I-PER

diehards O

Make O
a O
so-so O
adaptation O
and O
you O
risk O
the O
wrath O
of O
Austen’s B-PER
legions O
of O
readers: O
Take O
“Persuasion,” O
which O
caused O
a O
massive O
stink O
before O
it O
was O
even O
released O
in O
July B-LOC
when O
its O
trailer O
included O
snippets O
of O
new, O
modernized O
dialogue O
that O
chopped O
down O
Austen’s B-PER
original O
text O
and O
“Fleabag”-esque O
camera-mugging. O

It’s O
an O
unenviable O
task O
, O
condensing O
volumes’ O
worth O
of O
social O
critique O
, O
sparkling O
dialogue O
and O
characters O
so O
beloved O
that O
they’ve O
inspired O
an O
entire O
archetype O
of O
love O
interest O

But O
often O
, O
these O
films O
succeed O
and O
even O
reveal O
new O
layers O
to O
Austen’s O
canonical O
works O
. O

At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
they O
inspire O
debate O
among O
her O
many O
readers O
. O

CNN B-ORG
consulted O
several O
Austen B-PER
scholars O
and O
devotees O
to O
explain O
what O
they O
look O
for O
in O
an O
adaptation O
of O
Austen’s B-PER
work O
– O
and O
break O
down O
why O
the O
magic O
of O
her O
words O
can O
be O
so O
tricky O
to O
translate O
for O
the O
screen O

Why O
we O
love O
adapting O
Austen O
Viewed O
one O
way O
, O
Austen’s O
tales O
are O
quintessential O
romances O
. O

They’ve O
got O
all O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
the O
genre O
: O
Disapproving O
family O
, O
mismatched O
couples O
, O
hate-to-love O
relationships O
, O
long-awaited O
reunions O
, O
swoon-worthy O
declarations O
of O
love O
. O

We’ve O
seen O
these O
tropes O
crop O
up O
in O
nearly O
every O
romance O
story O
since O

So O
what O
makes O
Austen B-PER
’s O
romances O
so O
ripe O
for O
retelling O
? O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
it’s O
a O
shrewd O
business O
decision O
to O
revive O
Austen O
– O
there’s O
always O
an O
audience O
for O
her O
work O
, O
said O
Jillian B-PER
Davis I-PER
and O
Yolanda B-PER
Rodriguez I-PER

hosts O
of O

“ O
Pemberley B-ORG

which O
they O

various O
adaptations O

work O

“Complex O
interpersonal O
relationships O
will O
never O
go O
out O
of O
style,” O
Davis B-PER
and O
Rodriguez B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
an O
email. O

Over O
the O
years O
, O
Austen B-ORG
adaptations O
have O
made O
millions O
, O
been O
nominated O
for O
more O
than O
a O
dozen O
Oscars O
and O
several O
Emmys O

and O
convinced O
viewers O
the O
world O
over O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy B-PER
is O
the O
gold O
standard O
of O
suitors O

The O
’90s O
gave O
us O
a O
boom O
of O
Austen B-ORG
adaptations O
– O
the O
Firth-starring O
“Pride O
and O

“Emma” O
with O
Gwyneth B-PER
Paltrow, I-PER
“Sense O
and O
Sensibility” O
with O
Emma B-PER
Thompson I-PER
to O
name O
a O
few O
– O
and O
other O
Regency-era O
stories, O
similar O
to O
what O
we O
have O
now O
amid O
the O
enormous O
popularity O
of O
“Bridgerton.” O

Austen O
’s O
popularity O
spans O
the O
world O
– O
see O
the O
Bollywood-inspired O
film O
“Bride O
& O
Prejudice” O
and O
China’s B-LOC
“Mr. O
Pride O
vs. O
Miss O
Prejudice,” O
two O
of O
several O
Austen O
adaptations O
starring O
Asian O
protagonists. O

Though O
Austen B-PER
’s O
novels O
always O
folded O
love O
and O
marriage O
into O
their O
plots O
, O
the O
author O
didn’t O
always O
portray O
marriage O
as O
the O
seamless O
happy O
ending O
to O
which O
her O
heroines O
aspired O
. O

It’s O
a O
financial O
decision O
and O
a O
familial O
duty O
, O
of O
which O
her O
female O
characters O
are O
acutely O
aware O
. O

Austen’s O
women O
are O
often O
ambivalent O
about O
what O
it O
would O
mean O
for O
their O
independence O
if O
they O
marry O
, O
even O
when O
they O
genuinely O
love O
their O
partners O

Austen O

a O
way O
for O
today’s O

to O
both O
romanticize O
about O

so O

in O
that O
way O

she O

tales O
continue O

: O
They’re O
clear-eyed O

the O
best O
Austen B-ORG

get O
right O
A O

England B-LOC

In O
fact O
, O
Brodey B-PER
said O

she’d O
prefer O
a O

not O
feel O
indebted O
to O
the O
source O
novel O
. O

The O
Austenites O
CNN B-ORG
interviewed O
agreed O
– O
for O
an O
Austen O
adaptation O
to O
succeed O
, O
it O
needs O
to O
maintain O
the O
spirit O
of O
her O
work O
, O
especially O
her O
incisive O
depth O
and O
incomparable O
wit O
. O

What’s O
most O
challenging O
for O
any O
adapter O
of O
Austen O
must O
be O
capturing O
her O
fiction’s O
incredible O
combination O
of O
comedy O

of O

playfulness O

solidarity O
among O

the O
kind O
that O
Austen O
took O
seriously, O
too, O
said O
William B-PER
Galperin, I-PER
an O
English O
professor O
at O
Rutgers B-ORG
University I-ORG
and O
author O
of O
“The O
Historical O
Austen.” O

And O
like O
“Emma,” B-LOC
“Clueless” O
is O
more O
concerned O
with O
Cher’s B-PER
development O
than O
her O
romantic O
escapades, O
and O
even O
those O
plotlines O
serve O
to O
strengthen O
her O
character. O

Films O
that O
update O
, O
modernize O
or O
otherwise O
remix O
Austen O
for O
a O
new O
time O
, O
place O
or O
culture O
are O
, O
paradoxically O
, O
“more O
able O
to O
reveal O
new O
aspects O
of O
Austen O
than O
films O
that O
try O
to O
follow O
her O
novels O
more O
slavishly O
, O
Brodey B-PER
said O
. O

Even O
“Pride O
and O
Prejudice O
and O
Zombies,” O
though O
anything O
but O
subtle, O
found O
a O
parallel O
between O
“settling O
down” O
and O
zombiism. O

But O
aside O
from O
the O
rare O
battle O
between O
Bennets O
and O
the O
undead O
, O
Austen’s O
stories O
mine O
narrative O
riches O
out O

relatively O

“ O
What O
(Austen) O
is O
trying O
to O
suggest O
on O
the O
largest O
scale O
is O
that O
what O
goes O
on O
in O
the O
everyday O
basis O
of O
all O
of O
our O
lives O
is O
filled O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
implications O
,” O
Galperin B-PER
said O
.” O

It O
doesn’t O
have O
to O
involve O
big O
things O
like O
fights O
and O
power O
struggles O
on O
a O
grand O
sort O
of O

Ordinary, O
everyday O

all O
kinds O

the O

Where O
Austen B-ORG
adaptations O
fall O
short O
Condensing O
hundreds O
of O
pages O
of O
rich O
text O
– O
rife O
with O
social O
critique O
, O
gorgeous O
phrasing O
and O
revelatory O
inner O
musings O
– O
into O
a O
two-hour O
film O
or O
even O
a O
six-hour O
miniseries O
is O
no O
small O
feat O
. O

So, O
Galperin B-PER
said, O
some O
filmmakers O
focus O
on O
the O
most O
obvious O
strand O
in O
the O
story: O
The O
marriage O
plot. O

Relationships O
are O
of O
course O
important O
in O
Austen’s B-ORG
novels O
, O
but O
more O
often O
, O
Galperin B-PER
said O
, O
the O
marriage O
plot O
is O
the O
mere O
“scaffolding,” O
a O
skeleton O
of O
a O
story O
. O

The O
meat O
, O
he O
said O
, O
is O
in O
the O
narrative O
episodes O
that O
reveal O
her O
characters’ O
true O
intentions O
. O

Some O
adaptations O
– O
like O
the O
most O
recent O
“Persuasion,” O
according O
to O
many O
critics O
– O
lack O
the O
ambivalence O
and O
depth O
present O
in O
Austen’s O
books. O

Persuasion O
is O
a O
story O
of O
a O
“second O
chance O
at O
love” O
between O
unmarried O
Anne B-PER
Elliot I-PER
( O
played O
in O
the O
latest O
version O
by O
Dakota B-PER
Johnson I-PER
, O
whose O
“bloom” O
has O
decidedly O
not O
“vanished O
early” O
and O
her O
one-time O
partner O
Captain O
Wentworth O
. O

But O
it’s O
also O
concerned O
with O
familial O
duty O
, O
conformity O
and O
precious O
independence O
, O
and O
those O
themes O
, O
at O
least O
on O
screen O
, O
often O
come O
second O
to O
romance O
. O

The O
novel O
is O
extremely O
good O
at O
demonstrating O
that O
tension O
( O
between O
love O
and O
duty O
) O
, O
whereas O
the O
film O
just O
kind O
of O
flattens O
that O
into O
an O
early O
rejection O
, O
” O
Galperin B-PER
said O
. O

Often O
, O
Brodey B-PER
said O
, O
films O
“ O
overwhelmingly O
indulge O
in O
romance O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
social O
satire O
.” O

Why O
Austen’s O
stories O
will O
live O
forever O
Even O
if O
new O
versions O
of O
“Persuasion” O
and O
other O
classics O
aren’t O
necessarily O
successful O
in O
reinterpreting O
Austen’s O
work O
, O
they’re O
still O
worth O
making O
, O
Looser B-PER
said O
– O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
they’ll O
entice O
new O
audiences O
to O
fall O
for O
the O
brooding O
Darcy O
, O
the O
beachside O
bliss O
of O
Sanditon O
and O
the O
cunningly O
resourceful O
Lady O
Susan O
. O

If O
we O
don’t O
recreate O
Austen’s O
nineteenth-century O
stories O
for O
our O
own O
time O
, O
and O
attract O
new O
generations O
of O
viewers O
, O
then O
these O
texts O
won’t O
live O
on O
, O
” O
Looser B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

So O
I’m O
definitely O
all O
for O
adaptations O
that O
use O
Austen’s B-PER
material O
as O
an O
inspiration O
, O
and O
make O
their O
own O
mark O
on O
it O
, O
rather O
than O
treating O
her O
originals O
as O
blueprints O
that O
must O
be O
religiously O
copied O
. O

And O
continuing O
to O
spin O
new O
yarns O
out O
of O
Austen’s O
original O
work O
opens O
up O
her O
world O
to O
figures O
her O
books O
didn’t O
represent O

including O
people O
of O

Fire O

the O

framework O
of O
“Pride O

tell O
a O

Asian O
American O
gay O
men O
, O
the O
racism O
and O

experience O
from O
White O
gay O
men O
and O
the O
relationships O
they O
forge O
in O
spite O
of O
that O
hatred O
. O

Both O
“Sanditon” O

“Persuasion” O
cast O

set O
in O

era O

inspired O
debate O

since O
these O
projects O
often O
don’t O
address O

There O
are O
a O
million O
ways O
to O
tell O
an O

Elecare B-ORG
formula O

“ O

” O
– O
but O
the O
company O
has O
extended O
its O
rebates O
to O
states O
for O
another O
month O

Families O
who O
depended O
on O
certain O
formulas O
have O
already O
had O
to O
pivot O
to O
find O
new O
ways O
to O
feed O
their O
babies O

and O
they O
may O
still O
have O
to O
use O
different O
formula O
brands O
, O
travel O
long O
distances O
to O
find O
it O
and O
adhere O
to O
stores’ O
buying O
limits O

The O
Hankins’ O
9-month-old O
son O
, O
Orrin B-PER
, O
is O
allergic O
to O
ingredients O
in O
standard O
baby O
formula O
and O
needs O
a O
hypoallergenic O
variety O
. O

He O
had O
been O
on O
Similac O
Alimentum O
, O
which O
is O
made O
by O
Abbott B-ORG
. O

By O
June B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
find O
it O
in O
stores O
. O

They O
could O
order O
it O
online O
, O
but O
it O
wasn’t O
covered O
by O
benefits O
through O
Virginia’s B-LOC
Special O
Supplemental O
Nutrition O
Program O
for O
Women O
Infants O
and O
Children O
, O
or O
WIC O
. O

When O
they O
got O
it O
from O
retailers O
like O
Walmart.com B-ORG
, O
they O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
out O
of O
pocket O
– O
an O
expense O
that O
strained O
the O
family’s O
budget O
. O

So, O
in O
July, O
Hankins B-PER
worked O
with O
her O
state O
WIC B-ORG
program O
to O
switch O
her O
son O
to O
a O
different O
brand O
of O
hypoallergenic O
formula O
called O
Gerber B-ORG
Good I-ORG
Start I-ORG
Extensive I-ORG
HA, O
which O
is O
being O
flown O
into O
the O
US B-LOC
from O
the O
Netherlands. B-LOC

It’s O
one O
of O
several O
overseas O
brands O
being O
sold O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
since O
the O
shortage O
began O

Orrin B-PER
had O
struggled O
to O
switch O
formula O
in O
the O
past O
, O
but O
he O
did O
great O
, O
Hankins B-PER
said O

Still, O
the O
family O
travels O
about O
two O
hours O
round-trip O
from O
their O
home O
in O
Prince B-LOC
George I-LOC
County I-LOC
to O
get O
to O
stores O
that O
carry O
Orrin’s O
new O
formula. O

But O
Hankins B-PER
said O
she O
can O
always O
find O
the O
right O
one O

On O
their O
last O
trip O
, O
they O
found O
it O
at O
Kroger B-ORG
and O
Publix B-ORG
stores O
right O
next O
to O
each O
other O
and O
bought O
the O
maximum O
allowed O
: O
four O
cans O
at O
one O
store O
and O
three O
cans O
at O
the O
other O
. O

We O
got O
to O
use O
our O
WIC O
benefits O
for O
the O
month O
in O
one O
trip O
, O
which O
was O
great O
, O
” O
Hankins B-PER
said O
. O

If O
I’m O
only O
doing O
that O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
month O
instead O
of O
every O
couple O
days O
, O
it O
really O
is O
such O
an O
improvement O
. O

Vulnerable O
families O
still O
hit O
hard O
For O
families O
who O
can O
be O
flexible O
with O
the O
brands O
or O
types O
of O
formula O
they O
buy O
or O
the O
amount O
they O
can O
afford O
to O
pay O
, O
the O
shortage O
has O
eased O
considerably O
. O

But O
for O
others O
, O
the O
pain O
continues O
. O

Hypoallergenic O
and O
easy-to-digest O
formulas O
are O
still O
in O
very O
short O
supply O
, O
and O
Abrams B-PER
said O
families O
that O
need O
them O
face O
hardships O
. O

Hospital O
dietitians O
are O
scrambling O
to O
track O
them O
down O
for O
families O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
find O
a O
formula O
that O
a O
baby O
can O
tolerate O
, O
it O
may O
run O
out O
before O
it’s O
even O
delivered O
to O
the O
family’s O
home O
. O

Then O
the O
process O
of O
prescribing O
and O
ordering O
starts O
all O
over O
again O

Families O
that O
depend O
on O
WIC B-ORG
program O
benefits O
have O
more O
limited O
choices O
, O
too O
. O

Not O
all O
stores O
accept O
their O
benefits O
, O
and O
not O
all O
states O
have O
given O
families O
the O
flexibility O
to O
purchase O
alternatives O
if O
their O
normal O
brand O
is O
out O
of O
stock O
. O

Families O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
who O
may O
have O
only O
one O
or O
two O
stores O
in O
their O
area O
that O
sell O
baby O
formula O
, O
may O
also O
be O
looking O
at O
long O
drives O
to O
find O
more O
if O
those O
stores O
run O
out O
. O

The O
federal O
government O
has O
been O
working O
to O
alleviate O
the O
shortage O

The O
US B-ORG
Food I-ORG

Drug I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
eased O
rules O
allowing O
foreign O
manufacturers O
to O
sell O
their O
infant O
formula O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

In O
July O
, O
the O
agency O
said O
it O
was O
creating O
a O
framework O
to O
keep O
the O
door O
to O
foreign O
formula O
brands O
open O
permanently O
. O

The O

has O
sped O
the O
delivery O
of O
some O
of O
those O
cans O
through O

As O

says O
, O
17 O

missions O
had O
delivered O
enough O
powdered O
formula O
to O
make O
more O
than O
61 O
million O
8-ounce O
bottles O
. O

There’s O
a O
backlog O
that’s O
having O
to O
be O
filled O
out O
, O
but O
we O
are O
seeing O
measurable O
improvement O
, O
Dr. O
Robert B-PER
Califf I-PER
, O
commissioner O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
Food I-ORG
and I-ORG
Drug I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
, O
said O
Saturday O
on O
NPR’s B-ORG
All I-ORG
Things I-ORG
Considered I-ORG
. O

There’s O
more O
formula O
on O
the O
shelves O
, O
and O
the O
production O
now O
is O
exceeding O
the O
demand O
by O
a O
significant O
amount O
every O
week O
. O

So O
we’re O
on O
the O
road O
to O
recovery O
, O
but O
I O
don’t O
want O
anyone O
to O
think O
we O
are O
sitting O
back O
at O
this O
point O
. O

He O
said O
that O
when O
consumers O
see O
empty O
spots O
on O
store O
shelves O
, O
it O
doesn’t O
mean O
that O
type O
of O
formula O
is O
entirely O
out O
of O
stock O
, O
but O
certain O
sizes O
of O
it O
might O
be O

When O
formula O
manufacturers O
need O
to O
step O
up O
production O
, O
they O
cut O
back O
on O
the O
number O
of O
products O
they O
make O
to O
speed O
the O
process O
. O

Whereas O
they O
may O
have O
, O
let’s O
say O
, O
been O
making O
a O
1-pound O
, O
5-pound O
and O
a O
10-pound O
pack O
, O
they O
may O
reduce O
to O
just O
one O
type O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
as O
efficient O
as O
possible O
in O
turning O
out O
the O
formula O
, O
Califf B-PER
said O
. O

The O
key O
now O
is O
to O
stay O
the O
course O
, O
he O
said O
. O
“ O

What O
we O
need O
is O
just O
to O
continue O
for O
the O
next O
six O
to O
eight O
weeks O
for O
the O
production O
to O
far O
outstrip O
the O
amount O
that O
people O
need O
for O
their O
babies O
, O
and O
then O
we’ll O
be O
back O
in O
good O
shape O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
volume O
of O
formula O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

Still, O
the O
country O
is O
not O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
woods. O

How O
much O
longer O

on O
Monday O

that O
the O

was O

about O
going O

The O
comments O
by O
Mark B-PER
Robinson I-PER
, O
who O
has O
testified O
to O
the O
January B-LOC
6 I-LOC
committee O
, O
further O
corroborate O
key O
details O
first O
revealed O
by O
former O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
aide O
Cassidy B-PER
Hutchinson I-PER
, O
who O
spoke O
at O
length O
about O
Trump’s B-PER
behavior O
to O
the O
House B-ORG
select I-ORG
committee O
. O

Hutchinson O
said O
that O
she O
was O
told O
that O
Trump B-PER
became O
“irate” O
when O
informed O
by O
security O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
going O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
on O
January O
6 O
, O
because O
the O
situation O
was O
not O
secure O
. O

Robinson O
was O
not O
physically O
with O
Trump B-PER
on O
January O
6 O

He O
was O
in O
the O
lead O
car O
of O
the O
motorcade O
and O
said O
that O
he O
learned O
Trump B-PER
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Capitol O
through O
communications O
from O
the O
Secret B-ORG
Service I-ORG

We’ve O
heard O
it O
several O
times O
while O
it O
was O
on O
the O
motorcade O

I O
think O
during O
the O
speech O
, O
shortly O
thereafter O
, O
he O
had O
finished O
the O
speech O
, O
that O
the O
President O
was O
getting O
into O
the O
motorcade O
and O
he O
was O
upset O
. O

And O
he O
adamantly O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
,” O
Robinson B-PER
told O
Lemon B-PER
. O

And O
even O
when O
we O
departed O
from O
the O
Ellipse B-LOC
it O
was O
repeated O
again O
. O

It O
was O
a O
heated O
argument O
in O
the O
limo O
. O

And O
he O
wanted O
to O
definitely O
go O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
. O

In O
his O
first O
interview O
since O
testifying O
, O
Robinson B-PER
said O
he O
wasn’t O
aware O
of O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
riot O
when O
Trump B-PER
demanded O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
. O

Speaking O
in O
hindsight O
, O
Robinson B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
Now O
knowing O
what O
actually O
happened O
, O
that O
would’ve O
been O
horrible O
. O
” O

Had O
the O
motorcade O
responded O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
, O
I O
think O
, O
would’ve O
just O
been O
far O
worse O
. O
” O

I O
think O
it O
would O
have O
probably O
encouraged O
more O
rioting O

And O
(the O
rioters O
would O
have) O
felt O
supported. O

If O
the O
presidential O
motorcade O
came O
in O
support O
of O
them O

So O
I O
think O
the O
insurrectionists O
probably O
would O
have O
felt O
as O
though O
they O
had O
the O
support O
of O
the O
President O
,” O
Robinson B-PER
said O
. O

When O
questioned O
as O
to O
the O
former O
President’s O
possible O
motives O
for O
wanting O
to O
return O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
on O
January O
6 O
, O
Robinson B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
anyone O
, O
especially O
in O
that O
position O
, O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
. O
” O

You O
talk O
about O
the O
president O

I O
just O
can’t O
imagine O
someone O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
under O
those O
conditions O
.” O

Robinson O
said O
he O
is O
“so O
thankful” O
that O
the O
motorcade O
did O
not O
turn O
around. O

Had O
we O
made O
that O
move O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
been O
an O
insane O
movement O
and O
I O
think O
the O
sentiment O
was O
felt O
even O
with O
the O
Secret B-ORG

This O

with O
no O

One O
reason O
for O
( O
the O
) O
reduction O
in O
Atlantic B-LOC
seasonal O

from O
CSU B-ORG
is O
due O
to O
development O
of O
below-normal O
sea O

temperatures O

, O
Klotzbach B-PER
said O
. O

When O
the O
subtropical O
Atlantic B-LOC
is O
cooler O
than O
normal O
, O
it O
can O
sometimes O
favor O
increased O
shear O
in O

The O
probability O
of O

then O

Why O
the O
forecast O
numbers O
change O
These O
forecasts O
take O
into O
account O
a O
lot O
, O
such O
as O
sea-surface O
temperatures O
, O
La O
Niña O

“ O

One O
reason O
for O

in O
Atlantic B-LOC
seasonal O
#hurricane O
forecast O
from O

is O
due O
to O
development O

, O
it O
can O
sometimes O
favor O
increased O
shear O
in O
the O
tropical O
Atlantic B-LOC
. O

The O
world O
is O
in O
a O
La O
Niña O
pattern O
– O
a O
main O
reason O
forecasters O
initially O
went O
with O
above-average O
hurricane O
activity O
estimates O
early O
in O
the O
season O

La O
Niña O
pattern O
is O
a O
natural O
ocean-atmospheric O
phenomenon O
marked O
by O
cooler-than-average O
sea O
surface O
temperatures O
across O
the O
central O
and O
eastern O
Pacific B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
near O
the O
equator O
that O
consequently O
impact O
weather O
across O
the O
world O

While O
La O
Niña O
is O
certainly O
a O
big O
seasonal O
driver O
of O
how O
the O
tropical O
weather O
should O
play O
out O
, O
other O
phenomena O
that O
drive O
shorter-term O
variability O
are O
also O
key O
to O
updated O
forecasts O
. O

The O
Madden-Julian O
oscillation O
can O
either O
increase O
or O
decrease O
Atlantic B-LOC
hurricane O
activity,” O
Klotzbach B-PER
has O
said. O

The O
MJO O
is O
deep O
thunderstorm O
activity O
that O
propagates O
around O
the O
globe O
every O
about O
30 O
to O
60 O
days O
. O

As O
it O
does O
so O
, O
it O
can O
alter O
levels O
of O
vertical O
wind O
shear O
and O
mid-level O
moisture O
. O

Saharan O
dust O
and O
dry O
air O
have O
also O
been O
key O
contributors O
over O
the O
last O
month O

The O
MJO O
has O
prohibited O
thunderstorm O
development O
over O
Africa B-LOC
– O
important O
because O
thunderstorms O
that O
form O
in O
western O
Africa B-LOC
tend O
to O
flow O
west O
into O
the O
Atlantic B-LOC
, O
becoming O
the O
building O
blocks O
of O
tropical O
weather O
development O
. O

Forecasters O
are O
confident O
changes O
will O
soon O
foster O
an O
uptick O
in O
tropical O
systems O
. O

The O
models O
are O
generally O
forecasting O
a O
more O
conducive O
pattern O
for O
the O
Atlantic B-LOC
by O
the O
time O
that O
we O
get O
to O
the O
middle O
of O
August B-LOC
,” O
Klotzbach B-PER
reported O
. O

Air O
is O
forecast O
to O
more O
consistently O
rise O
over O
Africa B-LOC
and O
sink O
over O
the O
tropical O
Pacific B-LOC

This O
pattern O
should O
result O
in O
reduced O
vertical O
wind O
shear O
. O

This O
means O
environmental O
conditions O
will O
become O
ideal O
just O
in O
time O
for O
peak O
hurricane O
season O

Gulf B-LOC

East B-LOC
coasts O
face O
higher O
risks O
With O
only O
three O

far O
this O

, O
the O

off O

slower O

which O
had O
five O

by O
this O
date O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
point O
out O
that O
even O
the O

experienced O
a O
monthlong O
summer O
lull O
until O
Tropical O

Here’s O
why O
>>> O
Climatologically O
, O
about O
30% O
of O
all O
Atlantic B-LOC

make O
US B-LOC
landfall O
. O

But O
that O
statistic O
doesn’t O
always O
adequately O
reflect O
an O
eventful O
season O
. O

It’s O
important O
to O
understand O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
matter O
if O
there’s O
20 O
storms O
or O
one O
; O
if O
it O
impacts O
you O
, O
it’s O
a O
busy O
season O

For O
the O
Gulf B-LOC
Coast I-LOC
, O
the O
probability O
of O
a O
major O
hurricane O
landfall O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
this O
season O
is O
43 O
% O
, O
exceeding O
the O

of O
30 O

official O
said O
abortion O
rights O
are O
not O
a O
part O
of O

the O
issue O
has O
given O
Harris B-PER
some O
momentum O
after O
a O

the O

found O
herself O
fighting O
off O
negative O

internal O

Sen. O
Jean B-PER
Breaux I-PER
, O
a O

told O
CNN B-ORG
Sunday O
she O
could O
see O
abortion O

a O
chance O
for O
Harris B-PER

show O
off O
her O
leadership O

both O
now O

in O
the O

. O

I O
thought O
that O
there O
was O
something O
behind O
it O
for O
her O
, O
as O
well O
. O

That O
she O
was O
trying O
to O
position O
herself O
as O
a O
leader O
on O
this O
issue O
so O
that O
she O
could O
show O
America B-LOC
that O
she O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
lead O
and O
can O
articulate O
an O
issue O
that O
is O
resonating O
with O
voters O
all O
across O
the O
country O
, O
” O
she O
said O
after O
attending O
a O
roundtable O
event O
with O
the O
vice O
president O
last O
week O
. O

Breaux B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
still O
, O
she O
believed O
Harris B-PER
is O
“ O
sincerely O
concerned O
about O
abortion O
and O
the O
loss O
of O
abortion O
rights O
for O
women O
across O
this O
country O
” O
and O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
and O
others O
downplay O
the O
idea O
Harris B-PER
is O
making O
a O
political O
play O
by O
focusing O
on O
abortion O
. O

They O
argue O
she O
is O
only O
responding O
to O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court’s I-ORG
decision O
to O
overturn O
Roe B-PER
v. I-PER
Wade I-PER
, O
which O
established O
abortion O
as O
a O
constitutional O
right O
. O

This O
is O
not O
about O
the O
next O
election O
. O

This O
is O
about O
an O
assault O
on O
women’s O
reproductive O
rights O

This O
is O
about O
an O
extreme O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
that O
is O
willing O
to O
dismantle O
freedoms O
and O
erode O
rights O

I O
don’t O
think O
anybody’s O

it O

no O
action O
President O

take O
to O
restore O
the O

advocates O
have O
been O
pressuring O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
to O
do O
more O
on O
abortion O
rights O

The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
has O
dismissed O
several O
progressive O
ideas O

protect O

including O
allowing O

providers O

work O
from O
federal O
property O

where O
the O

Abortion O
rights O
have O
long O
been O
a O
prominent O
issue O
for O
Harris B-PER
in O
her O
campaigns O

When O
she O
ran O
for O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
presidential O
nomination O
in O
2019 O
, O
she O
vowed O
, O
if O
elected O
, O
to O
require O
states O
with O
a O
history O
of O
restricting O
abortion O
rights O
to O
obtain O
federal O
approval O
before O
any O
new O
abortion O
law O
could O
take O
effect O
. O

We O
cannot O
tolerate O
a O
perspective O
that O
is O
about O
going O
backward O
and O
not O
understanding O
women O
have O
agency O
, O
Harris B-PER
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O

She’s O
bringing O
that O
same O
intensity O
to O
her O
discussions O
with O
state O
lawmakers O
about O
how O
to O
respond O
to O
the O
Dobbs B-LOC

which O
the O

Harris B-PER

As O
a O

keenly O

The O

Harris B-PER
finds O
her O
voice O
on O
the O
road O
The O
vice O
president O
has O
been O
traveling O
from O
state-to-state O
this O
summer O
, O
sometimes O
making O
several O
trips O
per O
week O
since O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
overturned O
Roe B-PER
v. I-PER
Wade I-PER
at O
the O
end O
of O
June B-LOC

Harris B-PER
has O
focused O
on O
deeply O
red O
and O
purple O
states O
like O
Florida B-LOC
, O
Indiana B-LOC
, O
Virginia B-LOC
, O
North B-LOC
Carolina I-LOC
and O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
where O
state O
lawmakers O
have O
already O
put O
in O
place O
, O
or O
are O
discussing O
, O
newrestrictive O
measure O
to O
curtail O
or O
simply O
eliminate O
women’s O
access O
to O
an O
abortion O
. O

Harris O
will O
increase O
that O
already-ramped-up O
political O
travel O
over O
the O
next O
few O
months O
, O
with O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
trips O
focused O
on O
raising O
money O
for O
the O
DNC B-ORG
and O
Democratic B-ORG
Grassroots I-ORG
Victory I-ORG
Fund I-ORG
, O
according O
to O
a O
DNC B-ORG
official O
. O

She O
has O
been O
intentional O
about O
going O
to O
places O
and O
calling O
out O
mainly O
Republican O
governors O
in O
a O
way O
that O
we O
really O
haven’t O
done O
up O
until O
now O
, O
one O
aide O
said O
. O

Harris O
allies O
, O
who O
had O
previously O
criticized O
the O
administration’s O
use O
of O
the O
vice O
president O
, O
now O
herald O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
for O
positioning O
her O
in O
an O
effective O
way O
on O
an O
issue O
where O
she O
has O
“deep O
credibility O
.” O

This O
is O
just O
an O
area O
where O
she O
has O
a O
more O
defined O
profile O
, O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
official O
said O
, O
who O
noted O
her O
focused O
intensified O
after O
Harris B-PER
gave O
a O
forceful O
pro-abortion O
speech O
at O
Emily’s B-ORG
List I-ORG
hours O
after O
the O
draft O
opinion O
leaked O
. O

It O
was O
a O
confluence O
of O
events O
, O
ability O
and O
opportunity O
all O
in O
one O
. O

The O
official O
said O
Harris B-PER
then O
tasked O
her O
office O
with O
providing O
her O
data O
about O
wider O
implications O
of O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court’s I-ORG
decision O
, O
such O
as O
the O
effects O
if O
could O
have O
in O

fertilization O
( O
IVF O
) O
, O
access O
to O
birth O
control O
and O
same-sex O
marriage O
. O

Still, O
these O
latest O
appearances O
are O
giving O
hope O
to O
supporters O
who O
may O
have O
questioned O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
fierce O
former O
prosecutor O
who O
made O
headlines O
grilling O
Republicans O
during O
high-profile O
Senate O
hearings. O

If O
you O
think O
about O
her O
as O
a O
rising O
star O
in O
the O
party O
, O
that’s O
what O
people O
saw O
, O
one O
person O
allied O
with O
Harris B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

They’re O
like O
‘Yes, O
she’s O
a O
fighter O
for O
us.’ O

And O
so O
, O
her O
voice O
out O
there O
on O
this O
issue O
is O
helping O
both O
to O
literally O
fight O
the O
fight O
, O
but O
then O
also O
to O
mobilize O
voters O
and O
remind O
voters O
what O
she O
is O
uniquely O
adept O
at O
.” O

Less O
than O
100 O
days O
The O
roundtables O
with O
state O
legislators O
have O
been O
a O
winning O
model O
for O
the O
vice O
president O
, O
allies O
say O
, O
as O
it O
props O
up O
Harris’ B-PER
ability O
to O
convene O
and O
organize O
, O
while O
also O
shining O
a O
light O
on O
restrictive O
policy O
proposals O
across O
the O
country O
. O

They’ve O
also O
provided O
Harris B-PER
with O
an O
avenue O
to O
show O
the O
skills O
honed O
over O
years O
as O
a O
prosecutor O
and O
attorney O
general O
in O
California B-LOC
, O
providing O
a O
more O
emphatic O
voice O
on O
abortion O
rights O
than O
the O
President O
, O
who O
has O
a O
complicated O
history O
on O
the O
issue O
. O

I O
think O
on O
issues O
like O
this O
, O
it’s O
clear O
why O
they O
are O
a O
good O
pair O
, O
one O
source O
close O
to O
Harris B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

In O
this O
moment O
in O
crisis O
her O
unique O
history O
, O
credibility O
, O
and O
expertise O
is O
just O
invaluable O
both O
to O
the O
administration O
as O
well O
as O
the O
country O
, O
” O
said O
Karen B-PER
Finney I-PER
, O
vice O
chair O
of O
NARAL B-ORG

Democratic O
strategist O
The O
vice O
president O
has O
tasked O
staff O

with O
putting O
more O
of O
a O
focus O
on O
engaging O
younger O
voters O
as O
November O
grow O
closer O

And O
a O
source O
with O
a O
Democratic-aligned O
super O
PAC B-ORG
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
their O
focus O
groups O
show O
that O
Harris O
is O
still O
a O
popular O
figure O
with O
Black O
voters O
, O
despite O
the O
general O
dip O
in O
approval O
rating O
for O
the O
President O
. O

So O
that’s O
going O
to O
be O
an O
important O
angle O
down O
the O
road O
,” O
the O
source O
said O
, O
suggesting O
Harris O
be O
deployed O
to O
help O
Democrats O
in O
tight O
House O
races O
, O
such O
as O
Georgia’s B-LOC
Sanford B-PER
Bishop I-PER
or O
Ohio’s B-LOC
Amelia B-PER
Sykes I-PER
, O
who O
is O
vying O
for O
an O
open O
seat O
. O

The O
vice O
president O
will O
start O
campaigning O
with O
a O
relatively O
new O
team O
around O
her O
, O
after O
a O
series O
of O
staffers O
departed O
her O
office O
. O

A O
source O
familiar O
with O
office O
relations O
says O
that O
quicker O
decision-making O
has O
streamlined O
coordination O
with O
the O
West B-LOC
Wing I-LOC
and O
the O
vice O
president’s O
office O
during O
the O
administration’s O
second O
year O

One O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
official O
credited O
Anita B-PER

who O
returned O
to O
the O
White B-ORG

changes O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Wing I-LOC
, O
as O
responsible O
for O
some O
of O
the O
positive O
change O
. O

That’s O
led O
to O
Harris B-PER
becoming O
more O
of O
a O
public O
face O
than O
she O
was O
during O
her O
first O
year O
, O
doing O
more O
media O
interviews O
in O
2022 O
than O
in O

taken O

more O

the O

Abortion O
roundtables O
Harris B-PER
has O
held O
more O
than O
two O

roundtables O
on O
abortion O
rights O
since O
a O
draft O

In O
some O
ways O
, O
Harris B-PER
has O
been O
trying O
to O
create O
a O
national O
message O
for O
Democrats B-ORG

repeating O
at O
nearly O
every O

how O
“one O

for O

But O
advocates O
say O
Harris B-PER

be O

Salem B-LOC
witch O
trials O
reverberated O
in O
the O
North B-LOC
Andover I-LOC
area O
– O
and O
it O
was O
within O
those O
pages O
that O
she O
learned O
of O
Johnson O
. O

While O
many O
other O
convicted O
witches O
were O
exonerated O
, O
many O
of O
them O
posthumously O
, O
the O
late O
Johnson B-PER
– O
or O
“EJJ,” O
as O
LaPierre B-PER
and O
her O
students O
called O
her O
– O
had O
“somehow O
been O
overlooked O
while O
all O
other O
convicted O
witches O
had O
been O
exonerated O
over O
the O
years O
, O
LaPierre B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
an O
email O
. O

Details O
of O
Johnson’s B-PER
life O
are O
slim O
, O
but O
her O
family O
was O
a O
major O
target O
of O
the O
Salem B-LOC
witch O
trials O
, O
driven O
by O
hysteria O
, O
Puritanical O
rule O
and O
feuding O
between O
families O
. O

She O
was O
one O
of O
28 O
family O
members O
accused O
of O
witchcraft O
in O
1692 O
, O
according O
to O
the O
Boston B-ORG
Globe I-ORG
. O

Johnson O
made O
a O
compelling O
confession O
during O
a O
court O
examination O
: O
She O
said O
that O
another O
woman O
, O
Martha B-PER
Carrier I-PER
, O
“perswaded O
her O
to O
be O
a O
witch” O
and O
that O
Carrier B-PER
told O
her O
she O
“Should O
be O
Saved O
if O
she O
would O
be O
a O
witch,” O
according O
to O
a O
1692 O
document O
digitized O
by O
the O
University B-ORG
of O
Virginia’s O
Salem B-LOC
Witch O
Trials O

Archive O

Some O
of O
the O
details O
of O
her O
story O
were O
sordid O
and O
mortifying O
to O
Salem’s B-LOC
residents O
: O
Johnson B-PER
said O
the O
devil O
appeared O
to O
her O
“ O
like O
two O
black O
Catts O
,” O
and O
she O
named O
several O
other O
people O
in O
Salem B-LOC
whom O
she O
said O
were O
involved O
in O
witchcraft O
. O

She O
also O
showed O
her O
knuckles O
, O
where O
it O
appeared O
fellow O
“witches” O
had O
“suckt O
her,” O
according O
to O
the O
1692 O
examination O
document O
. O

For O
her O
“crimes,” O
Johnson B-PER
was O
sentenced O
to O
death O
at O
age O
22, O
as O
the O
Boston B-ORG
Globe I-ORG
reported O
last O
year, O
but O
she O
was O
given O
a O
reprieve O
by O
the O
governor O
at O
the O
time O
( O
whose O
wife O
had O
also O
been O
accused O
of O
witchcraft O
) O

In O
1711 O
, O
after O
state O
officials O
realized O
they’d O
had O
little O
evidence O
to O
convict O
and O
execute O
or O
imprison O
women O
( O
and O
some O
men O
) O
for O
witchcraft O
, O
they O
exonerated O
many O
of O
those O
who’d O
been O
convicted O
or O
even O
hanged O
, O
including O
John B-PER
Proctor I-PER
, O
later O
one O
of O
the O
protagonists O
in O
Arthur B-PER
Miller’s I-PER
play O
“ O
The O
Crucible O
.” O

Johnson’s O
name O
though O
was O
omitted O
from O
this O
list O
. O

So O
in O
1712 O
, O
she O
petitioned O
Salem B-LOC
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
act O
, O
which O
provided O
restitution O
to O
families O
of O
the O
accused O
. O

In O
the O
letter O
, O
she O
asked O
“ O
That O
the O
Honourable O
Court O
would O
please O
to O
allow O
me O
Something O
in O
consideration O
of O
my O
charges O
by O
reason O
of O
my O
Long O
Imprisonment O
, O
which O
will O
be O
thankfully O
acknowledged O
as O
a O
great O
favour O
.” O

Why O
, O
exactly O
, O
Johnson B-PER
was O
left O
out O
is O
unclear O
. O

But O
LaPierre B-PER
decided O
, O
after O
connecting O
with O
the O
North B-LOC
Andover I-LOC
Historical B-ORG
Society I-ORG
, O
LaPierre B-PER
that O
taking O
up O
the O
case O
of O
a O
long-dead O
“witch” O
and O
clearing O
her O
name O
could O
be O
an O
engaging O
project O
for O
her O
students O
– O
a O
real-life O
application O
of O
civics O
in O
action O
. O

Johnson B-PER
is O
the O
last O
Salem B-LOC
witch O
to O
be O
exonerated O
So O
LaPierre’s B-PER
eighth-graders O
set O
out O
on O
exonerating O
EJJ O
, O
petitioning O
the O
Massachusetts B-LOC
legislature O
with O
the O
hopes O
that O
a O
lawmaker O
would O
introduce O
a O
bill O
to O
clear O
her O
name O
. O

Eventually O
, O
after O
three O
years O
and O
“numerous O
disappointments,” O
one O
state O
senator O
heard O
them O
– O
Diana B-PER
DiZoglio I-PER
sponsored O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
state O
budget O
this O
year O
to O
add O
Johnson’s O
name O
to O
an O
existing O
resolution O
that O
exonerated O
other O
“witches” O
by O
name. O

All O
that O
petitioning O
and O
bureaucratic O
navigating O
was O
instructive O
for O
her O
eighth-grade O
classes O
, O
but O
LaPierre B-PER
said O
“ O
the O
long-lasting O
lessons O
are O
probably O
more O
important O
: O
Standing O
up O
for O
justice O
, O
advocating O
for O
those O
who O
cannot O
do O
so O
for O
themselves O
, O
recognizing O
that O
their O
voices O
have O
power O
in O
the O
community O
and O
the O
world O
, O
and O
understanding O
that O
persistence O
is O
necessary O
to O
achieve O
their O
goals O
. O
” O

The O
amendment O
adds O
Johnson’s O
name O
to O
a O
1957 O
resolution O
that O
exonerated O
several O
people O
convicted O
of O
witchcraft O
– O
and O
so O
, O
finally O
, O
Johnson’s O
wish O
for O
absolution O
was O
granted O
. O

But O
the O
work O
for O
LaPierre B-PER
continues O
: O
She’ll O
have O
to O
find O
a O
new O
project O
for O
her O
incoming O
eighth-graders O
now O
that O
Johnson’s B-PER
case O
is O
closed O
. O

She’s O
leaving O
it O
up O
to O
her O
students O
this O
year O
to O
determine O
the O
issues O
they O
care O
about O
and O
the O
courses O
of O
action O
they’ll O
take O
to O
address O
them O

Whatever O
her O
students O
choose O
to O
tackle O
this O
year O
, O
witches O
are O
likely O
off O
the O
table O
: O
Johnson B-PER
is O
the O
final O
woman O
convicted O
in O
the O
Salem B-LOC
trials O
to O
be O
exonerated O
. O

And O
with O
that O
, O
LaPierre B-PER
and O
her O
class O
ended O
a O
chapter O
in O
history O
that O
began O
centuries O

Months O

what O

But O
since O

their O

derailed O
by O
the O
highest O
inflation O
in O
more O
than O
40 O

and O
slumping O

Rising O

has O
forced O
many O

to O
pull O

particularly O
low-and-middle O

several O

Cash-strapped O

struggling O

have O
curtailed O
their O

This O
has O
left O

with O
too O
much O
of O
the O
wrong O
stuff O
: O
Think O
back O
to O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
pandemic O
, O
when O
everyone O
was O
redoing O
their O
homes O
and O
buying O
new O

Stores O
are O
overloaded O
with O
that O

they O
need O
to O
discount O
those O

These O

mispositioned O
their O

said O
Brian B-PER

“In O

Marcos B-PER
has O
not O

There, O
the O

a O

its O

With O
so O
many O
options O
to O
consider O
, O
choosing O
a O
new O
credit O
card O
can O
be O
daunting O
. O

But O
for O
most O
Americans O
, O
it’s O
a O
necessary O
step O
to O
establishing O
credit O
. O

About O
92 O
million O
Americans O
have O
little O
to O
no O
credit O
history O
, O
according O
to O
Equifax B-ORG
. O

With O
scant O
information O
to O
go O
on O
, O
it’s O
harder O
for O
credit O
bureaus O
to O
assess O
the O
likelihood O
that O
a O
person O
will O
be O
able O
to O
pay O
back O
a O
loan O
or O
line O
of O
credit O
. O

One O
way O
to O
build O
your O
credit O
history O
is O
by O
opening O
and O
using O
a O
credit O
card O

So O
how O
do O
you O
decide O
which O
card O
is O
right O
for O
you O
? O

Here O
are O
the O
most O
important O
factors O
to O
consider O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
new O
card O
: O
Is O
your O
credit O
score O
high O
enough O
? O

Most O
cards O
have O
credit O
score O
requirements O
, O
among O
other O
criteria O
, O
so O
it’s O
important O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
your O
score O
is O
and O
whether O
it’s O
good O
enough O
for O
you O
to O
be O
approved O

But O
what O
exactly O
constitutes O
a O
good O
credit O
score O
? O

Ted B-PER
Rossman I-PER
, O
senior O
industry O
analyst O
at O
Bankrate.com B-ORG
, O
explains O
that O
an O
excellent O
credit O
score O
is O
“ O
generally O
defined O
[ O
as O
740 O
or O
higher O
on O
the O
FICO O
scale O
, O
which O
goes O
from O
300 O
to O
850 O
.” O

The O
FICO O
score O
represents O
how O
likely O
you O
are O
to O
pay O
back O
your O
credit O
card O
bill O
based O
off O
previous O
payments O

Although O
many O
credit O
cards O
have O
a O
FICO O
score O
cutoff O
of O
670 O
, O
it’s O
not O
a O
strict O
limit O
. O

“ O
The O
average O
FICO O
score O
is O
716 O
, O
so O
most O
people O
are O
in O
the O
right O
ballpark O
for O
most O
cards O
,” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
” O

If O
you O
want O
to O
raise O
your O
credit O
score O
, O
Rossman B-PER
said O
the O
key O
is O
paying O
your O
credit O
card O
bills O
on O
time O
, O
keeping O
your O
balance O
low O
and O
proving O
that O
you O
can O
successfully O
manage O
various O
types O
of O
credit O
over O
the O
long O
haul O
. O

And O
that O
can O
take O
time O

Much O
of O
this O
is O
a O
marathon O
, O
not O
a O
sprint O
, O
” O
he O
noted O
. O

For O
those O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
improve O
a O
lower O
credit O
score O
or O
who O
are O
seeking O
to O
build O
credit O
, O
Rossman B-PER
suggests O
secured O
cards O
, O
which O
are O
backed O
by O
a O
security O
deposit O
and O
are O
often O
held O
in O
a O
linked O
bank O
account O
. O

This O
functions O
as O
collateral O
should O
you O
fail O
to O
pay O
your O
monthly O
bill O

These O
cards O
also O
have O
strict O
limits O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
cardholders O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
than O
they O
deposited O
upfront O

So O
if O
your O
security O
deposit O
was O
$500 O
, O
your O
spending O
limit O
will O
be O
$500 O
. O

What O
rewards O
does O
it O
offer O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
types O
of O
credit O
card O
rewards O
– O
cash O
back O
, O
points O
and O
miles O
. O

Cash O
back O
rewards O
pay O
cardholders O
a O
percentage O
of O
what O
they O
have O
spent O
on O
purchases O

The O
cash O
accumulated O
can O
typically O
be O
redeemed O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
check O
or O
direct O
deposit O
, O
applied O
to O
future O
balances O
as O
a O
statement O
credit O
, O
or O
sometimes O
used O
to O
make O
purchases O
. O

Points O
and O
miles O
rewards O
cards O
give O
cardholders O
the O
option O
to O
redeem O
their O
rewards O
for O
travel O
, O
and O
other O
products O
and O
services O
. O

Whichever O
form O
of O
rewards O
you O
choose O
, O
you’ll O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
enables O
you O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
your O
purchases O
. O

Start O
by O
considering O
how O
you O
spend O
your O
money O
. O

While O
some O
cards O
offer O
more O
rewards O
for O
spending O
categories O
like O
travel O
and O
dining O
, O
others O
offer O
better O
benefits O
for O
grocery O
store O
purchases O
and O
gas O
. O

Others O
will O
rotate O
the O
categories O
that O
offer O
the O
highest O
rewards O
, O
or O
even O
let O
you O
choose O
. O

Many O
people O
prefer O
cash O
back O
rewards O
because O
they O
are O
easier O
to O
navigate O
and O
do O
not O
require O
tracking O
purchase O
categories O
, O
according O
to O
Rossman B-PER

He O
suggests O
finding O
a O
card O
that O
gives O
2% O
cash O
back O
on O
every O
purchase O

If O
you’re O
willing O
to O
dabble O
with O
different O
cards O
in O
order O
to O
chase O
more O
rewards O
, O
Rossman B-PER
recommends O
having O
a O
cash O
back O
card O
for O
general O
purchases O
, O
and O
then O
layering O
in O
other O
cards O
for O
more O
specific O
categories O
. O

Use O
something O
like O
[ O
a O
general O
cash O
back O
card O
] O
as O
a O
floor O
, O
guaranteeing O
you’ll O
never O
get O
less O
than O
2% O
cash O
back O
on O
a O
given O
purchase O
, O
and O
lean O
into O
categories O
in O
which O
you O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER

Be O
mindful O
of O
fees O
While O
many O
banks O
won’t O
charge O
you O
anything O
just O
to O
have O
a O
credit O
card O
, O
some O
rewards O
cards O
will O
charge O
annual O
fees O
, O
typically O
ranging O
from O
$95 O
per O
year O
to O
as O
much O
as O
$695 O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
the O
better O
the O
rewards O
, O
the O
more O
annual O
fees O
, O
” O
said O
David B-PER
Lord I-PER
, O
general O
manager O
at O
Credit.com B-ORG
. O

While O
some O
of O
those O
fees O
might O
seem O
high O
, O
they O
can O
be O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
know O
you O
will O
use O
all O
the O
benefits O
the O
card O
offers O
. O

These O
are O
often O
travel O
cards O
with O
premium O
perks O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O

The O
annual O
fee O
might O
be O
well O
worth O
it O
if O
you’re O
going O
to O
make O
good O
use O
of O
the O
airport O
lounge O
, O
the O
free O
checked O
bags O
or O
other O
perks O
, O
but O
not O
if O
you O
rarely O
travel O
. O

Another O
common O
fee O
is O
the O
foreign O
transaction O
fee O
– O
which O
typically O
adds O
3% O
to O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
products O
and O
services O
bought O
in O
other O
countries O

If O
you O
travel O
abroad O
often O
, O
you’ll O
want O
to O
avoid O
cards O
that O
charge O
such O
fees O
. O

Most O
cards O
will O
also O
charge O
late O
payment O
fees O
. O

Up O
to O
$30 O
for O
the O
first O
offense O
and O
up O
to O
$41 O
for O
subsequent O
offenses O
within O
six O
billing O
cycles O
,” O
said O
Rossman B-PER

Another O
important O
fee O
to O
consider O
is O
a O
cash O
advance O
fee O
. O

But O
Rossman B-PER
advises O
against O
using O
a O
credit O
card O
to O
get O
cash O
. O

There’s O
a O
separate O
fee, O
plus O
interest O
starts O
accruing O
immediately O
at O
a O
higher O
rate O
than O
normal O
purchases. O

How O
high O
are O
the O
interest O
rates O
? O

While O
credit O
card O
interest O
rates O
can O
go O
as O
high O
as O
36% O
, O
the O
average O
credit O
card O
charges O
about O
17% O
, O
according O
to O
Bankrate B-ORG
. O

These O
fees O
can O
really O
add O
up O
if O
you O
don’t O
pay O
off O
your O
balance O
every O
month O
. O

For O
those O
who O
carry O
a O
balance O
, O
the O
accrued O
interest O
can O
easily O
cancel O
out O
any O
rewards O
the O
card O
offers O
. O

It O
doesn’t O
make O
sense O
to O
pursue O
1% O
, O
2% O
or O
even O
5% O
in O
cash O
back O
( O
or O
an O
equivalent O
amount O
of O
airline O
miles O
or O
hotel O
points O
) O
if O
you’re O
paying O
a O
high O
interest O
rate O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER

But O
figuring O
out O
the O
interest O
rate O
might O
not O
be O
as O
simple O
as O
it O
sounds O

Cards O
often O
charge O
different O
rates O
on O
purchases O
versus O
balance O
transfers O
or O
cash O
advances O

And O
most O
credit O
card O
issuers O
offer O
variable O
rates O
, O
which O
means O
they O
can O
change O
over O
time O
. O

Many O
cards O
will O
also O
offer O
an O
introductory O
rate O
– O
some O
as O
low O
as O
0% O
– O
for O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
time O

But O
cardholders O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
the O
rate O
can O
skyrocket O
when O
the O
period O
ends O

As O
long O
as O
you’re O
diligent O
about O
paying O
the O
card O
off O
before O
the O
introductory O
period O
expires O
, O
a O
0% O
rate O
on O
purchases O
can O
prove O
to O
be O
a O
big O
financial O
benefit O
. O

That’s O
especially O
true O
for O
people O
looking O
to O
make O
a O
few O
big O
purchases O
– O
like O
a O
vacation O
or O
wedding O
– O
early O
in O
the O
term O
but O
need O
a O
little O
more O
time O
to O
pay O
it O
off O

You O
can O
divide O
what O
you O
owe O
by O
the O
number O
of O
months O
remaining O
and O
try O
to O
stick O
to O
it O
, O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O

I O
think O
this O
makes O
more O
sense O
than O
constantly O
making O
a O
series O
of O
purchases O
with O
the O
0% O
card O
. O

Overall O
, O
when O
picking O
that O
new O
plastic O
, O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
one-size-fits-all O
. O

Instead, O
it’s O
about O
doing O
the O
research O
and O
finding O
what O
works O
best O
for O
you. O

, O
and O
87 O
people O
were O
arrested O
for O
criminal O

In O
September O
, O
protests O
began O
to O
take O
place O
nightly O
in O
Louisville B-LOC
after O
a O

didn’t O
charge O
the O

By O
then O
, O
Taylor B-PER

was O
known O
nationally O
and O
beyond O
, O
just O
as O
Floyd B-PER

was O
, O
and O
her O
death O
was O
a O
central O
part O
of O
the O
protests O
that O
rocked O
the O
country O
throughout O
much O
of O
2020 O
. O

Celebrities O
took O
up O
the O

of O
Taylor’s O

, O
who O
put O
Taylor O

The O
aftermath O
Those O
protests O
sparked O
a O
movement O
demanding O
a O
change O
in O
policing O
and O
even O
seeking O
to O
defund O
police O
departments O

Police O
and O
some O
witnesses O
gave O
conflicting O
reports O
on O
whether O
the O
officers O
announced O
themselves O
before O
battering O
down O
Taylor’s O
door O

but O
her O
death O
drew O
attention O
to O
no-knock O

The O
officer O
who O
rammed O
the O
door O
at O
Taylor’s B-PER
apartment O
testified O
at O
Hankison’s B-PER
state O
trial O
that O
police O
announced O
themselves O
four O
or O
five O
times O

In O
Louisville B-LOC
, O
the O
controversy O
led O
to O
the O
passing O
of O
“Breonna’s O
Law” O
in O
June O
2020 O
, O
which O
bans O
such O
warrants O
and O
requires O
officers O
to O
wear O
body O

when O
carrying O
out O
search O

. O

Almost O
a O
year O
later O
, O
in O
April O
2021 O
, O
the O
Kentucky B-LOC
state O
legislature O
passed O
a O
bill O
setting O
restrictions O
on O
no-knock O
warrants O
but O
did O
not O
outlaw O
them O
outright O
. O

In O

In O
September O
2020 O
, O
the O
city O
of O
Louisville B-LOC
agreed O
to O
pay O
a O
historic O
$12 O
million O
in O
a O

with O
Taylor’s B-PER
family O
. O

It O
included O
an O
agreement O
for O
the O
city O
to O
introduce O
police O
reforms O

The O
settlement O
stipulated O
the O
city O
would O
establish O
a O

credit O
program O
as O
an O

for O

to O
live O
in O
the O
areas O
they O
serve O

use O
social O
workers O
to O
provide O

on O
certain O
police O

require O

to O
review O
and O
approve O
search O

before O
seeking O
judicial O
approval O
, O
among O
other O
changes O

lives O
in O
her O
honor O

Taylor’s O

at O
the O

No O
amount O

process O
all O
the O

sometimes O
there’s O

the O

Sigmund B-PER
Freud I-PER
, O
who O
wrote O
the O
first O
scholarly O
research O
on O
interpreting O
dreams O
, O
thought O
they O
primarily O
reveal O
secrets O
and O
embarrassing O
moments O
from O
our O
past O

But O
his O
mentee-turned-rival O
, O
Carl B-PER
Jung I-PER
, O
thought O
dreams O
tap O
into O
universal O
archetypes O

contain O
clues O

our O
subconscious O
life O
to O
help O
us O
find O
happiness O
and O
answers O

Another O
theory O
is O
that O
dreams O
act O

, O
a O
way O
to O

That O
seems O
a O
likely O
explanation O
of O

where O
intense O
negative O
emotions O
such O
as O

fear O
reside O
, O
Peterkin B-PER
explained O

They O
are O
useful O
, O
according O
to O
researchers O

because O
they O
can O
help O
train O
your O
brain O
to O
prepare O
for O
challenges O

fears O
in O

By O
the O
way O

by O

you O
travel O

I O
’ve O
been O

attention O

my O

lately O

Sarah B-PER
Polley I-PER

“ O

After O
20 O
years O
in O
psychoanalysis O
and O
psychotherapy O
I’m O
used O
to O
noticing O
them O

They’re O
smoke O
signals O

my O
attention O

But O
lately O
I’ve O
also O
started O
to O
see O
dreams O
as O
guides O
, O
pointing O
the O
way O
forward O

‘Poor O

One O
more O
benefit O
of O
recounting O

recording O
your O
dreams O
is O
simply O
escape. O

And O
who O
doesn’t O
need O
a O
vacation O

In O
your O
dreams O
you O
can O
visit O
the O
past O
or O
future O
, O
go O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
or O
off O

and O
fly O

As O
Kahlil B-PER
Gibran I-PER
put O
it O
more O
poetically O

“permit O
us O

surrender O
ourselves O

perhaps O
the O
beautiful O

The O
word O
dream O
comes O
from O
the O
Old O
English O
word O
for O
“joy, O
noise O
or O
music.” O

And O
there O
is O
joy O
in O
recording O
the O
music O
or O
deciphering O
the O
noise O

Dreams O
can O
be O
“an O
incredible O
virtual O

model O
of O

Peterkin B-PER

“updated O

others O
, O
Sarah B-PER
Silverman I-PER
was O
my O
therapist O
, O
Ally B-PER
Sheedy I-PER
and O
I O
had O
a O
fling O
while O
we O
made O
an O
’80s O
movie O
together O
, O
and O
I O
played O
Han B-PER

version O

I O
went O

the O
1800s O

with O

at O

time O
I O
attended O
Gen. O

E. I-PER
Lee’s I-PER
funeral O
. O

And O
I O
was O
the O
Batman O

I O
can O
remember O
these O
dreams O
and O
hundreds O
more O
because O
I O
have O
been O
writing O
them O
down O
since O
high O
school O

It’s O
the O
simple O
act O
of O
recording O
dreams O
that O
keeps O
them O
from O
evaporating O
in O
the O
sunlight O
of O
day O

Total O
recall O
Of O
the O
many O
dream-themed O
movies O
, O
my O
two O
favorites O
are O
Christopher B-PER
Nolan I-PER
’s O
“Inception” O
and O
the O
lesser-known O
1991 O
Wim B-PER
Wenders I-PER

“Until O

World,” O

Sam B-PER
Neill I-PER

Max B-PER

Sydow I-PER

As O
a O
subplot O
in O
“Until,” O
the O
main O
characters O
find O
a O
way O
to O
video-record O
their O
dreams O
and O
subsequently O
become O
narcissistically O
addicted O
to O
watching O
them O
( O
to O
the O
point O
of O
madness O
) O

You’re O
now O
looking O
at O
the O
human O
soul O
, O
singing O
to O
itself O
. O

To O
its O
own O
God O
! O

von O
Sydow B-PER
’s O
character O
says O
. O

As O
fun O
as O
that O
sounds O
, O
present-day O
technology O
has O
not O
advanced O
us O
to O
the O
point O
of O
DVRing O
our O
dreams O
( O
yet O
) O

The O
closest O
thing O
available O
is O
writing O
them O
down O
. O

There’s O
little O
you O
need O
to O
get O
started O

Find O
a O
dream O
journal O
app O
or O
designate O
a O
notebook O
to O
keep O
next O
to O
your O
bed O

And O
the O
next O
time O
you O
recall O
a O
dream O
, O
even O
a O
hazy O
, O
half-remembered O
one O
, O
write O
it O
down O
. O

Even O
if O
it’s O
boring O
and O
doesn’t O
seem O
worth O
remembering O
, O
write O
it O
down O
. O

The O
more O
you O
get O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
recording O
them O
, O
the O
better O
your O
recall O
will O
get O
. O

I O
also O
leave O
a O
scrap O
of O
paper O
out O
in O
case O
I O
make O
some O
scribbled O
notes O
of O
key O
words O
and O
elements O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O

Even O
a O
single O
detail O
can O
bring O
back O
the O
memory O
of O
an O
entire O
dream O

Telling O
someone O
your O
dream O
soon O
after O
you O
wake O
up O
can O
also O
help O
hold O
on O
to O
it O
until O
you O
write O
it O
down O

My O
dream O
journals O
have O
evolved O
over O
the O
years O
to O
include O
headlines O
for O
them O
, O
tracking O
themes O
, O
people O
and O
locations O
, O
as O
well O
as O
noting O
how O
many O
were O
“good” O
“bad” O
or O
“neutral/in O
between.” O

I O
do O
that O
to O
look O
for O
trends O
, O
but O
don’t O
make O
the O
bar O
too O
high O
for O
yourself O
, O
especially O
when O
you’re O
starting O
. O

I O
also O
, O
on O
occasion O
, O
will O
write O
a O
note O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dream O
if O
I O
feel O
I O
have O
some O
insight O
into O
its O
meaning O
. O

I O
may O
instantly O
recognize O
that O
a O
dream O
about O
being O
lost O
in O
a O
city O
is O
really O
about O
losing O
a O
work O
file O
, O
for O
example O
. O

Dream O
dictionaries O
compile O
mythology O
, O
psychology O
and O
cultural O
symbolism O
and O
can O
be O
interesting O
to O
look O
up O
reoccurring O
themes O
in O
, O
even O
if O
there O
is O
little O
that O
is O
scientific O
about O
them O
, O
except O
in O
a O
Jungian O
collective O
, O
unconscious O
way O
. O

Just O
remember O
always O
to O
interpret O
a O
dream O
through O
your O
personal O
experience O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
dream O
dictionary O
may O
suggest O
a O
dog O
in O
a O
dream O
means O
loyalty O
. O

But O
if O
you’re O
scared O
of O
dogs O
, O
it O
more O
likely O
represents O
something O
else O
you’re O
afraid O
of O
. O

Or O
if O
your O
mom O
owns O
five O
dogs O
, O
your O
dream O
dog O
may O
be O
standing O
in O
for O
her O
. O

As O
the O
great O
myth O
expert O
Joseph B-PER
Campbell I-PER
put O
it O
, O
“Myths O
are O
public O
dreams O
, O

six O
takeaways O
from O
Tuesday O
night’s O
primaries O
: O
Kansas B-LOC
maintains O
constitutional O
right O
to O
abortion O
Kansas B-LOC
voters O
sent O
a O
dramatic O
message O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
opting O
to O
maintain O
the O
right O
to O
an O
abortion O
in O
their O
state’s O
constitution O
just O
weeks O
after O
the O
US B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
decided O
to O
overturn O
Roe B-PER
v. I-PER
Wade I-PER
. O

Polls O
have O
long O
shown O
that O
voters O
overwhelmingly O
support O
protecting O
abortions O
rights O

But O
the O
win O
for O
the O
“no” O
vote O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
is O
proof O
of O
that O
and O
signals O
that O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
decision O
has O
further O
angered O
voters O
and O
possibly O
shifted O
the O
politics O
of O
the O
issue O
ahead O
of O
the O
November B-LOC
elections O
. O

The O
“no” O
leaves O
the O
state O
constitution O
unchanged O

While O
lawmakers O
in O
the O
state O
can O
still O
try O
to O
pass O
restrictive O
abortion O
laws O
, O
courts O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
have O
recognized O
a O
right O
to O
abortion O
under O
the O
state O
constitution O
. O

The O
biggest O
warning O
to O
Republicans B-ORG
, O
many O
of O
whom O
have O
trumpeted O
the O
overturning O
of O
Roe O
and O
backed O
pushes O
to O
pass O
stricter O
abortions O
laws O
, O
is O
perhaps O
the O
turnout O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
. O

With O
78% O
of O
the O
vote O
in O
on O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
nearly O
700,000 O
people O
have O
cast O
ballots O
in O
the O
primary O
, O
a O
figure O
that O
already O
dwarfs O
the O
turnout O
in O
the O
2020 O
presidential O
primary O
election O
. O

This O
is O
further O
proof O
of O
what O
poll O
after O
poll O
has O
told O
us O
: O

that O

The O
latest O
case O
in O
point: O
the O
coronavirus O
rebound. O

The O
condition O
grabbed O
international O
attention O
last O
week O
when O
US O
President O

tested O
positive O
for O
the O
virus O
six O
days O
after O
testing O
negative O
following O
his O
first O
bout O
of O
the O
illness O

The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
said O
Biden O
, O
who O
is O
back O
in O
isolation O
, O
was O
experiencing O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
“loose O
cough” O
but O
did O
not O
have O
a O
fever O
and O
his O
lungs O
were O
“clear.” O

The O
President O
tested O
positive O
again O
after O
being O
treated O
with O
the O
antiviral O
Paxlovid O
. O

White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
had O
previously O
suggested O
a O
rebound O
case O
of O
Covid O
was O
unlikely O
, O
based O
on O
reports O
of O
cases O
around O
the O
country O
, O
but O
Biden’s B-PER
doctors O
continued O
to O
monitor O
his O
health O
and O
test O
him O
. O

Dr. O
Ashish B-PER
Jha I-PER
, O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
Covid O
response O
coordinator O
, O
said O
clinical O
data O
shows O
the O
rate O
of O
rebound O
infections O
is O
low O
and O
noted O
that O
even O
those O
who O
suffer O
them O
are O
still O
generally O
protected O
from O
serious O
illness O
. O

Biden B-PER
is O
not O
the O
only O
high-profile O
patient O
to O
develop O
the O
condition O

Fauci I-PER
also O
experienced O
rebound O
Covid-19 O

Unlike O
Biden B-PER
’s O
his O
symptoms O
got O
worse O
when O
they O
returned O
after O
treatment O
with O
Paxlovid B-ORG
, O
and O
his O
doctors O
prescribed O
another O
course O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

Experts O
have O
been O
calling O
for O
more O
systematic O
research O
into O
the O
instances O
of O
rebound O
to O
understand O
who O
is O
most O
at O
risk O
and O
whether O
the O
standard O
five-day O
course O
of O
Paxlovid O
should O
be O
lengthened O
to O
prevent O
it O

Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
people O
can O
pass O
the O
infection O
to O
others O

a O
rebound O

is O
another O
reason O

The O

that O
Paxlovid B-ORG
“continues O

in O
both O

YOU O

Q: O
How O
does O
Paxlovid B-ORG
work? O

A: O
Considered O
a O
game-changer O
when O
it O
was O
authorized O
in O
December O
because O
of O
its O
strong O
performance O
in O
lowering O
the O
risk O
of O
severe O
Covid-19 O
, O
Paxlovid O
– O
in O
combination O
with O
vaccines O
and O
boosters O
– O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ways O
to O
protect O
people O
at O
high O
risk O
for O
severe O
illness O
. O

The O
drug O
suppresses O
the O
coronavirus O
, O
blocking O
an O
enzyme O
that O
helps O
it O
reproduce O
inside O
the O
body O
. O

As O
with O
all O
antivirals O
, O
the O
treatment O
is O
thought O
to O
work O
best O
if O
started O
within O
five O
days O
of O
the O
first O
symptoms O
appearing O
. O

Clinical O
trials O
of O
Paxlovid B-ORG
showed O
that O
it O
reduced O
the O
risk O
of O
hospitalization O
and O
death O
by O
88% O
when O
given O
within O
five O

the O
current O
$7,500 O

as O
well O
as O
a O
$4,000 O

off O

It O
also O
gets O

that O

automakers O
off O

after O
they’ve O
sold O
200,000 O

and O
it O
is O
written O
so O

can O

instead O
of O
waiting O

there’s O

take O

the O

Shortly O
before O
the O
US B-LOC
withdrawal O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Defense B-ORG
Department I-ORG
created O
a O
task O
force O
responsible O
for O
handling O
counterterrorism O
strikes O
inside O
the O
country O
after O
American B-LOC
troops O
had O
left O
– O
a O
so-called O
“over O
the O
horizon” O
strategy O
that O
officials O
promised O
would O
keep O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
once O
again O
becoming O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
terror O
groups O
like O
al B-ORG

and O
ISIS B-ORG
to O
flourish O
. O

More O
than O
a O
year O
after O
the O
creation O
of O
that O
task O
force O
, O
sources O
say O
it O
hasn’t O
sent O
a O
single O
proposed O
target O
to O
the B-ORG
Pentagon I-ORG
for O
approval O
– O
largely O
because O
without O
a O
presence O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
it O
hasn’t O
been O
able O
to O
build O
enough O
intelligence O
on O
targets O
to O
meet O
the O
administration’s O
standards O
for O
avoiding O
civilian O
casualties O
. O

The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
has O
hailed O
the O
CIA B-ORG
operation O
that O
killed O
al O
Qaeda O
leader O
Ayman B-PER
al-Zawahiri I-PER
in O
Kabul B-LOC
on O
Saturday O
as O
evidence O
that O
using O
over O
the O
horizon O
counterterrorism O
capabilities O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
has O
been O
effective O

Current O
and O
former O
officials O
say O
the O
successful O
Zawahiri B-PER
strike O
certainly O
proves O
that O
with O
the O
right O
intelligence O
, O
the O
US B-ORG
is O
perfectly O
capable O
of O
tackling O
a O
specific O
target O
from O
afar O
– O
but O
those O
same O
sources O
also O
said O
that B-PER
Zawahiri I-PER
, O
a O
single O
, O
high-value O
target O
long O
in O
the O
CIA’s B-ORG
crosshairs O
, O
was O
a O
special O
case O
that O
doesn’t O
alone O
prove O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
strategy O
. O

There’s O
a O
difference O
between O
tracking O
one O
senior O
high O
value O
target O
and O
dealing O
with O
the O
resurgence O
of O
these O
terrorist O
groups O
inside O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
said O
Beth B-PER
Sanner I-PER

It’s O
a O
just O
a O
whole O
different O
ball O
of O
wax O
. O

Some O
intelligence O
officials O
have O
publicly O
raised O
concerns O
that O
terrorist O
activity O
incubated O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
will O
spread O
outside O
the O

borders O
and O
pose O
a O
threat O
to O
the O

– O
and O
that O
the O

will O
be O
blind O

it O

I’m O
worried O
about O
the O
possibility O
that O
we O
will O
see O

reconstitute O

he O
added O

Hinting O
at O
how O
high O
the O
hurdles O
have O
become O
, O
some O
intelligence O
and O
military O
officials O
who O
were O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
closely-held O
planning O
details O
of O
the O
Zawahiri B-PER
operation O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
was O
still O
able O
to O
successfully O
carry O
out O
such O
a O
precision O
strike O
, O
according O
to O
a O
former O
intelligence O
official O
still O
in O
contact O
with O
former O
colleagues O
. O

Administration O
officials O
say O
that O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
Zawahiri B-PER
strike O
is O
proof O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
is O
successfully O
monitoring O
and O
countering O
the O
threat O
without O
American O
boots O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

Sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
intelligence O
behind O
the O
strike O
say O
the O
US B-ORG
integrated O
lots O
of O
different O
nuggets O
of O
data O
from O
multiple O
streams O
of O
intelligence O
to O
locate O
and O
target O
Zawahiri B-PER

I O
think O
I’m O
more O
satisfied O
and O
more O
confident O
[ O
in O
US B-ORG
intelligence O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
] O
than O
I O
was O
even O
a O
week O
ago O
because O
of O
what O
that O
collection O
just O
enabled O
, O
which O
was O
a O
pretty O
remarkable O
, O
pretty O
precise O
action O
, O
” O
a O
senior O
administration O
official O
told O
CNN B-ORG
on O
Friday O
. O
“ O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
haven’t O
been O
other O
uses O
of O
force O
of O
that O
type O
in O
the O
past O
year O
means O
that O
we O
are O
monitoring O
and O
we O
are O
being O
judicious O
– O
and O
where O
we O
think O
it O
reaches O
the O
point O
of O
needing O
to O
act O
, O
we’re O
acting O
, O
” O
the O
official O
said O
. O

But O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
pretty O
powerful O
demonstration O
of O
what O
that O
capability O
can O
provide O
. O

The O
US B-LOC
now O
largely O
relies O
on O
drone O
flights O
and O
human O
networks O
on O
the O
ground O
to O
gather O
information O
about O
what O
is O
going O
on O
inside O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
according O
to O
a O
former O
intelligence O
official O
and O
the O
source O
familiar O
with O
the O
intelligence O
. O

But O
drone O
flights O
from O
the O
Gulf B-LOC
are O
logistically O
complicated O
and O
have O
limited O
loiter O
time O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
thanks O
to O
the O
long O
flight O
, O
making O
them O
expensive O
to O
use O
and O
limiting O
their O
usefulness O
. O

And O
without O
a O
US B-LOC
presence O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
intelligence O
professionals O
expect O
human O
networks O
may O
degrade O
over O
time O
. O

I O
think O
we O
don’t O
know O
what O
we O
don’t O
know O
, O
one O
former O
official O
said O
. O

Difficult O
questions O
For O
now O
, O
there O
is O
broad O
consensus O
inside O
the O
intelligence O
community O
that O
the O
immediate O
threat O
that O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
Afghanistan B-LOC
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
to O
plan O
attacks O
on O
the O
US B-ORG
homeland O
or O
US B-ORG
interests O
remains O
low O
. O

But O
difficult O
questions O
remain O
about O
whether O
that O
risk O
will O
grow O
over O
time O

Much O
depends O
on O
current O
unknowns O
– O
in O
particular O
, O
how O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
responds O
to O
the O
killing O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
. O

Will O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
actually O
let O
AQ O
use O
Afghanistan B-LOC
? O

said O
one O
source O
familiar O
with O
the O
intelligence O
. O

There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
factors O
that O
play O
into O
this O
debate O
, O
this O
person O
said O
. O
“ O

And O
all O
complicated O
. O

The O
intelligence O
community O
in O
its O
annual O
threat O

released O
this O

rates O
the O
threat O
from O
al O

in O
Yemen B-LOC

Somalia B-LOC

West B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
as O
a O
greater O
risk O
to O
US B-ORG
interests O
abroad O
than O
its O
weakened O
leadership O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
officials O
believe O
, O
is O
still O
gauging O
its O
ability O
to O
operate O
under O
Taliban B-ORG
rule O
and O
will O
likely O
remain O
focused O
on O
maintaining O
its O
safe O
haven O
rather O
than O
planning O
external O
operations O
– O
at O
least O
for O
now O
. O

And O
although O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
leaders O
have O
enjoyed O
“increased O
freedom O
of O
action” O
under O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
, O
according O
to O
a O
recent O
UN B-ORG
report O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O
major O
influx O
of O
new O
fighters O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
since O
the O
US B-ORG
withdrawal O
— O
a O
reflection O
of O
how O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
has O
evolved O
away O
from O
centrally-planned O
attacks O
, O
according O
to O
some O
analysts O
. O

But O
as O
for O
what O
happens O
next O
, O
one O
US B-ORG
source O
described O
the O
analysis O
across O
intelligence O
agencies O
as O
“ O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O
” O

What O
we O
don’t O
think O
we O
have O
occurring O
is O
some O
sort O
of O
regrowth O
[ O
or O
] O
regeneration O
of O
an O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
operational O
presence O
— O
even O
with O
less O
famous O
names O
[ O
than O
Zawahiri B-PER
] O
, O
” O
the O
senior O
administration O
official O
said O
. O

There O
is O
one O
school O
of O
thought O
that O
while O
some O
elements O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
may O
feel O
honor-bound O
to O
uphold O
its O
oath O
to O
shield O
old O
guard O
members O
of O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
like O
Zawahiri B-PER
, O
it O
has O
no O
obligation O
or O
incentive O
to O
make O
welcome O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
fighters O
. O

And O
according O
to O
intelligence O
officials O
, O
there O
are O
vanishingly O
few O
members O
of O
the O
original O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
leadership O
who O
remain O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
none O
of O
whom O
are O
likely O
to O
replace O
Zawahiri B-PER
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
recent O
strike O
, O
some O
analysts O
argue O
, O
may O
dissuade O
terrorist O
leaders O
from O
traveling O
to O
the O
country O
from O
elsewhere O
. O

They O
argue O
that O
the O
far O
greater O
risk O
is O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
affiliates O
in O
Africa B-LOC
and O
elsewhere O
that O
are O
only O
loosely O
connected O
to O
core O
leaders O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC

There’s O
some O
people O
who O
are O
very O
worried O
,” O
said O
Sanner B-PER
, O
who O
is O
now O
a O
contributor O
at O
CNN B-ORG
. O

I O
personally O
think O
that O
AQ O
core O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
doesn’t O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
operational O
planning O
. O

Others O
assess O
that O
it’s O
more O
likely O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
– O
consumed O
with O
trying O
to O
legitimize O
its O
government O
amid O
a O
financial O
implosion O
and O
an O
ongoing O
conflict O
with O
ISIS-K B-ORG
– O
simply O
may O
not O
have O
the O
bandwidth O
to O
prevent O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
being O
used O
by O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
or O
its O
affiliates O
to O
plan O
attacks O
on O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC

There O
are O
also O
concerns O
that O
the O
remnants O
of O
al O

may O
simply O
be O
absorbed O
into O
the O
Taliban B-ORG

The O
UN B-ORG

How O

it’s O
not O
clear O

Some O

are O
hopeful O

, O
that O

help O
push O
the O

towards O
some O
sort O
of O

cooperation O
with O
the O

a O

according O
to O
two O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O

I O
think O
this O
was O
a O
symbolic O
strike O
that O
removed O
an O

It O
completes O
the O
task O
of O
removing O
the O
two O
people O
who O
were O
at O
the O
center O
of O
9/11 O

But O
it O
is O
the O
end O
of O
an O

it O
is O
not O
about O

it’s O
a O

through O
the O
West B-LOC

This O
is O
the O
driest O
it O
has O
been O
in O
1,200 O
years O
. O

Who O
has O
the O
right O
? O

The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
runs O
from O
the O
Rocky B-LOC
Mountains I-LOC
in O
Colorado B-LOC
, O
through O
Denver B-LOC
, O
and O
courses O
northeast O
alongside O
I-76 O
toward O
Nebraska B-LOC
. O

Along O
the O
way O
, O
the O
city O
gives O
way O
to O
miles O
of O
farms O
and O
ranches O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
Colorado-Nebraska B-LOC
border O
. O

But O
much O
of O
that O
land O
is O
now O
brown O

Concerns O
about O
how O
much O
water O
– O
or O
how O
little O
– O
is O
flowing O
down O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
led O
Ricketts B-PER
to O
announce O
the O
$500 O
million O
plan O
to O
build O
a O
canal O
on O
Colorado B-LOC
land O
to O
funnel O
water O
into O
a O
Nebraska B-LOC
reservoir O
system O
during O
the O
non-irrigation O
months O
in O
the O
fall O
and O
winter O

Without O
this O
compact O
and O
our O
ability O
to O
enforce O
our O
rights O
, O
we O
will O
see O
the O
dramatic O
impact O
upon O
our O
state O
, O
Ricketts B-PER
said O
in O
an O
April O
press O
conference O
, O
pointing O
to O
Colorado’s B-LOC
ever-growing O
population O
and O
its O
estimate O
of O
nearly O
$10 O
billion O
for O
282 O
new O
projects O
along O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
. O

Should O
all O
the O
long-term O
goals O
be O
affected O
, O
they O
would O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
water O
flows O
coming O
to O
the O
state O
of O
Nebraska B-LOC
by O
90 O
%. O

That O
rationale O
raised O
eyebrows O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
. O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
many O
of O
those O
projects O
are O
not O
necessarily O
going O
to O
come O
to O
fruition O
, O
” O
Kevin B-PER
Rein I-PER
, O
Colorado’s B-LOC
state O
engineer O
and O
director O
of O
the O
Colorado B-LOC
Division O
of O
Water O
Resources O
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
noting O
that O
the O
state O
curtails O
usage O
based O
on O
water-rights O
seniority O
to O
ensure O
that O
Nebraska B-LOC
still O
gets O
the O
water O
it O
has O
the O
right O
to O
. O

In O
the O
99-year O
history O
of O
the O
compact O
, O
we O
have O
complied O
with O
those O
provisions O
of O
the O
compact O
, O
” O
Rein B-PER
said O
. O

They O
are O
getting O
what O
they O
agreed O
to O
. O

Despite O
the O
population O
growth O
in O
Denver B-LOC
, O
Rein B-PER
said O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
water O
used O
has O
decreased O
because O
of O
conservation O
efforts O
. O

However O
, O
the O
state O
acknowledges O
future O
expansion O
could O
impact O
supplies O
. O

Development O
along O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
could O
begin O
to O
diminish O
flows O
as O
they O
travel O
down O
the O
river O
toward O
the O
lower O
section O
of O
the O
river O
and O
ultimately O
Nebraska B-LOC
, O
Rein B-PER
said O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
building O
a O
canal O
would O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
Colorado B-LOC
water O
rights O
, O
Rein B-PER
said O
. O

But O
overall O
he O
believes O
the O
compact O
is O
good O
for O
Colorado B-LOC

It’s O
really O
two O
states O
getting O
along O
, O
he O
explained O
. O

What O
we O
have O
is O
good O
for O
farmers O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
and O
good O
for O
farmers O
in O
Nebraska B-LOC
in O
that O
region O
that O
are O
part O
of O
a O
community O
and O
work O
together O

And O
they’re O
the O
ones O
that O
could O
be O
impacted O
. O

The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
Compact O
allows O
Nebraska B-LOC
500 O
cubic O
feet O
of O

with O
some O
conditions O

in O
the O

However O
, O
during O

, O
from O

Critically O

For O
Jay B-PER
Goddard I-PER
, O
a O

fifth-generation O
rancher O
in O
this O
corner O
of O

history O
literally O
stretches O
across O
his O
land O
. O

Goddard’s O
ranch O
bears O
a O
two-and-a-half-mile O
scar O
from O
when O
Nebraska B-LOC
began O
— O
but O
never O
finished O
— O
digging O
a O
Perkins B-LOC
County I-LOC
canal O
more O
than O
a O
century O
ago O

Well O
, O
obviously O
, O
nobody O
wants O
to O
lose O
any O
of O
their O
property O
, O
Goddard B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
while O
walking O
along O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
ditch O
, O
with O
the O
interstate O
highway O
and O
Nebraska B-LOC
visible O
in O
the O
distance O
. O

The O
ground O
on O
his O
ranch O
is O
dry O
and O
brittle O
. O

There’s O
usually O
water O
standing O
in O
some O
of O
these O
lagoons O
and O
they’re O
completely O
dry O
right O
now O
. O

He’s O
also O
concerned O
about O
the O
impacts O
of O
the O
canal O
on O
the O
overall O
health O
of O
the O
river O

I O
hope O
it O
doesn’t O
knock O
down O
the O
flow O
during O
the O
wintertime O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hunters O
that O
come O
to O
this O
area O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
wildlife O
— O
whether O
geese O
, O
turkey O
, O
deer O
and O
ducks O
— O
that O
come O
through O
on O
a O
migration O
and O
so O
I’m O
worried O
that O
it O
will O
dry O
up O
the O
river O
at O
the O
wrong O
time O
, O
” O
Goddard B-PER
said O
. O

Not O
only O
would O
that O
hurt O
Julesburg B-LOC
’s O
tourism O
and O
economy O
, O
but O
it O
would O
also O
impact O
its O
neighbors O
’ O
businesses O
as O
well O
. O

Goddard O
explained O
that O
the O
border O
is O
porous O
, O
with O
many O
— O
like O
him O
— O
having O
operations O
in O
both O
states O
. O

I O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
my O
[agriculture] O
producers O
and O
the O
folks O
that O
bank O
on O
our O
[agriculture] O
lending O
side O
are O
taken O
care O
of O
well O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
line O
Goddard B-PER
said O

Just O
on O
the O
other O
side O
in O
Nebraska B-LOC
, O
farmer O
Darrel B-PER
Armstrong I-PER
sees O
the O
issue O
as O
less O
about O
Nebraska B-LOC
versus O
Colorado B-LOC
and O
more O
a O
battle O
of O
“ O
agriculture O
against O
urban O
.” O

We O
feel O
that O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
agreements O
that O
have O
been O
made O
that O
[rural O
areas O
are] O
coming O
up O
short,” O
Armstrong B-PER
said O
to O
CNN B-ORG
. O

The O
people O
who O
are O
upholding O
the O
agreements O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
making O
the O
agreements O
. O

According O
to O
Cech B-PER
, O
the O
population O
expansion O
in O
the O
High B-LOC
Plains I-LOC
was O
enabled O
by O
the O
agriculture O
industry O
. O

If O
you O
don’t O
have O
irrigation O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
– O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
– O
all O
you’re O
going O
to O
grow O
is O
probably O
prickly O
pear O
cactus O
and O
sagebrush O
,” O
Cech B-PER
said O
. O

Water O
is O
key O
to O
that O
economic O
growth O
, O
not O
only O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
or O
Western B-LOC
Nebraska I-LOC
, O
but O
in O
California B-LOC
and O
the O
West B-LOC
in O
general O
. O

As O
the O
drought O
lingers O
, O
which O
Armstrong B-PER
called O
, O
“ O
very O
devastating O
, O
” O
the O
tougher O
the O
conditions O
for O
his O
business O
. O

We O
are O
looking O
at O
potentially O
zero O
production O
on O
our O
dry O
land O
crops O
without O
water O
,” O
he O
said O

He O
agrees O
with O
Goddard B-PER
that O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
needs O
to O
be O
protected O

“ O
The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
basically O
is O
the O
lifeblood O
to O
our O
surface O
aquifer O
and O
so O
we O
need O
to O
somehow O
keep O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
running O
,” O
Armstrong B-PER
said O
.” O

We’re O
seeing O
less O
and O
less O
come O
down O
the O
river O
from O
what O
we O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Lawsuits O
could O
delay O
Nebraska B-LOC
from O
moving O
forward O
with O
its O
canal O
project O

But O
for O
now O
, O
on O
these O
farms O
and O
ranches O
, O
there O
are O
more O
questions O
than O
answers O
. O

What O
can O
they O
do O
for O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it’s O
not O
disrupting O
my O
production O
, O
but O
also O
my O
other O
producers O
in O
this O
area O
. O

rancher O
Goddard O
wondered O

It’s O
just O
beginning O
of O
a O
new O
era O
of O
water O
wars O
in O
an O
age O
of O
unprecedented O
climate O
change O
as O

dry O
up O

Human O
nature O
is O
our O

, O
I O
believe O
, O
in O
trying O
to O

in O

, O
Cech B-PER

The O
Federal B-ORG

war O

eventually O
kill O
the O
economic O
recovery O
from O
Covid-19 O
, O
former O
Fed B-ORG
official O
Bill B-PER
Dudley I-PER
warns O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
began O
its O
quest O
to O
tame O
inflation O
late O
, O
leaving O
the O
central O
bank O
little O
choice O
other O
than O
to O
slam O
the O
brakes O
on O
the O
economy O
by O
drastically O
raising O
interest O
rates O
. O

Almost O
certainly O
there O
will O
be O
a O
full-blown O
recession O

If O
we’re O
not O
in O
one O
yet O
, O
I O
think O
we O
will O
be O
in O
the O
next O
12 O
months O

” O
Dudley B-PER

told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
a O

Recession O
fears O
mounted O
after O
government O
statistics O
last O
week O
showed O
the O
US B-LOC
economy O
contracted O
in O
the O
spring O
for O
the O
second O
quarter O
in O
a O
row O

Although O
Dudley B-PER
concedes O
the O
US O
economy O
has O
clearly O
slowed O
, O
he O
doesn’t O
believe O
it O
has O
weakened O
enough O
to O
qualify O
as O
a O
recession O
— O
at O
least O
not O
yet O
. O

He O
pointed O
to O
“too O
strong” O
payroll O
growth O
and O
factory O
activity. O

It’s O
not O
broad O
or O
deep O
enough O
,” O
Dudley B-PER
said O
of O
the O
slowdown O
. O
“ O

What O
we O
have O
seen O
to O
date O
is O
not O
sufficient O
by O
itself O
to O
be O
a O

. O

The O
unemployment O
rate O
remains O
at O
3.6% O
, O
near O
the O
lowest O
levels O
in O
the O
past O
half-century O

However O
, O
if O
the O

continues O
to O

later O

Dudley B-PER

it’s O

the O

, O
the O

Soft O
or O

? O

Federal O

insist O
they O
can O
still O
pull O
off O
a O
so-called O
soft O

the O

at O
a O

We O
think O
there’s O
a O
path O
for O
us O
to O
be O
able O
to O
bring O

down O
while O
sustaining O

” O
Federal B-ORG

Chairman O

last O

Yet O
Powell B-PER
conceded O
the O
task O

gotten O
trickier O

We O
know O
that O
the O

it O

Dudley B-PER
‘They’re O

rates O
last O
week O
by O
three-quarters O
of O
a O
percentage O
point O
at O
its O
second O
consecutive O

Dudley O
said O
the O
challenge O
for O
the O
Fed B-ORG
is O
due O
in O
part O
to O
its O
own O
poor O
forecasting O
: O
the O
central O
bank O
didn’t O
begin O
to O
raise O
interest O
rates O
until O
inflation O
was O
already O
very O
high O
. O

They O
got O
going O
really O
slowly O
Dudley B-PER
said O

They’re O
late O
and O
that O
means O
they O
have O
to O
do O
more O

And O
that O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
recession O

I O
think O
a O
recession O
is O
highly O
likely O
, O
and O
I’ll O
be O
very O
, O
very O
surprised O
if O
they O
avoid O
a O
recession O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
Dudley B-PER
is O
betting O
any O
looming O
recession O
would O
be O
“mild” O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
decline O
because O
corporate O
and O
household O
balance O
sheets O
are O
in O
decent O
shape O

He O
did O
caution O
however O
that O
continued O
high O
inflation O
means O
the O
Fed B-ORG
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
swiftly O
come O
to O
the O
rescue O
with O
interest O
rate O
cuts O
aimed O
at O
curtailing O

It O
could O
last O

it O
may O
be O
that O
the O

ease O

US B-LOC
markets O
have O
ripped O
higher O
since O
last O
week’s O
Fed B-ORG
meeting O
as O
investors O
seized O
on O
potential O
hints O
from O
Powell B-PER
that O
the O
central O
bank O
may O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
slow O
the O
pace O
of O
its O
rate O
hikes O

Stocks O
have O
continued O
to O
rally O
despite O
a O
flurry O
of O
comments O
this O
week O
from O
current O
Fed B-ORG
officials O
signaling O
the O
war O
on O
inflation O
is O
nowhere O
near O
over O

Dudley B-PER
warns O
investors O
are O
misinterpreting O
the O
signals O
from O
the O
Fed O
, O
adding O
that O
he O
was O
“ O
a O
little O
bit O
puzzled O
” O
by O
the O
market O
reaction O
. O

The O
Fed B-ORG
is O
still O
far O
away O
from O
the O
amount O
of O
slack O
they O
need O
in O
the O
labor O
market O
and O
from O
the O
2% O
inflation O
target O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Dudley O
added O
that O
another O
rate O
hike O
of O
three-quarters O
of O
a O
percentage O
point O
is O
still O
“potentially O
in O
play,” O
depending O
on O
how O
the O
economy O
evolves. O

He O
expects O
the O
Fed B-ORG
will O
need O
to O
raise O
interest O
rates O
to O
4% O
or O
higher O
— O
up O
from O
2.5% O
today O

All O
of O
that O
runs O
counter O
to O
the O
enthusiasm O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
S&P O
500 O
finished O
Wednesday O
at O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
nearly O
two O
months O
, O
while O
the O
Nasdaq O
has O
surged O
to O
levels O
unseen O
since O
early O
May O
. O

Dudley O
warned O
that O
the O
uptick O
in O
the O
stock O
market O
may O
be O
counterproductive O
because O
it O
translates O
to O
easier O
financial O
conditions O

And O
that’s O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O
Fed B-ORG
wants O
as O
it O
tries O
to O
tame O
inflation O

Ironically O
, O
Dudley B-PER
said O
, O
the O
big O
rally O
in O
financial O
markets O
increases O
pressure O
on O
the O
Fed O
to O
do O
more O
. O

World B-ORG

, O
told O

the O
announcement O
represents O
a O
major O
win O
for O

alike O
. O

Tigers O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
and O
everywhere O
else O
that O
they O
live O
in O
Asia B-LOC
, O
about O
10 O
countries O
, O
were O
on O
a O
steady O
decline O
because O
of O
two O
key O
reasons O
, O
” O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

The O
most O
immediate O
reason O
was O
poaching O
for O
the O
illegal O
animal O
trade O

The O
second O
reason O
was O
loss O
of O
habitat O
.” O
“ O

In O
2010 O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
we O
were O
going O
to O
lose O
tigers O
unless O
we O
made O
a O
concerted O
effort O
to O
turn O
things O
around O
. O

Governments O
of O
countries O
home O
to O
tigers O
then O
set O
a O
goal O
to O
double O
the O
number O
of O
wild O
tigers O
by O
2022 O
at O
the O
St. B-LOC
Petersburg I-LOC
International I-ORG
summit O
on O
tiger O
conservation O

Nepal B-LOC
is O
the O
first O
country O
to O
release O
updated O
tiger O
numbers O
in O
2022 O

Hemley O
said O
Nepal B-LOC
“really O
does O
stand O
out O
as O
a O
leader O
in O
conservation, O
especially O
for O
tigers.” O

There O
is O
support O
for O
conservation O
of O
tigers O
at O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
government O
,” O
she O
said O
. O

That O
has O
translated O
into O
really O
effective O
habitat O
conservation O
, O
bolstering O
the O
protection O
of O
tigers O
in O
national O
parks O
, O
the O
wildlife O
reserves O
. O

According O
to O
Hemley B-PER
, O
one O
of O
Nepal’s B-LOC
major O
conservation O
strengths O
is O
its O
focus O
on O
wildlife O
corridors O
, O
which O
are O
forested O
pathways O
to O
help O
connect O
otherwise O
fragmented O
pieces O
of O
tiger O
habitat O
. O

Nepal B-LOC
has O
been O
a O
pioneer O
in O
reforesting O
areas O
to O
make O
sure O
those O
connections O
are O
restored O
and O
maintained O
,” O
she O
explained O
. O

As O
they O
mature O
and O
move O
away O
from O
their O
parents O
, O
“ O
tigers O
need O
to O
disperse O
. O
” O

That O
dispersal O
is O
only O
possible O
if O
tigers O
can O
move O
around O
safely O
. O

The O
other O
key O
factor O
in O
Nepal’s B-LOC
tiger O
comeback O
is O
community O
involvement O
in O
conservation O
projects O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Communities O
are O
the O
driving O
force O
behind O
this O
” O
she O
said O
.” O

They O
are O
employed O
to O
do O
reforestation O
, O
maintain O
that O
habit O
, O
and O
are O
directly O
involved O
in O
conservation O
. O

The O
World B-ORG
Wildlife I-ORG
Fund I-ORG
has O
become O
involved O
in O
ecotourism O
projects O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
, O
added O
Hemley B-PER

As O
the O
tiger O
population O
has O
recovered O
, O
protected O
national O
parks O
for O
tigers O
have O
become O
popular O
tourist O
attractions O
, O
with O
the O
revenue O
from O
parks O
helping O
to O
support O
community O
needs O
. O

This O
fosters O
a O
sense O
of O
community O
investment O
in O
conservation O
projects O
, O
Hemley B-PER
explained O

Another O
key O
ingredient O
in O
recovering O
tiger O
populations O
is O
finding O
ways O
for O
humans O
and O
tigers O
to O
safely O
coexist O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

What’s O
really O
needed O
is O
a O
holistic O
approach O
,” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

Monitoring O
tigers O
, O
knowing O
where O
they’re O
living O
, O
can O
help O
communities O
stay O
safer O
. O

Nepal B-LOC
has O
also O
found O
success O
with O
practical O
tools O
, O
like O
predator-proof O
fencing O
for O
livestock O
and O
lighting O
the O
perimeters O
of O
villages O
at O
night O
to O
ward O
off O
tigers O
. O

Deploying O
compensation O
programs O
for O
farmers O
whose O
livestock O
are O
killed O
by O
tigers O
also O
enables O
better O
human-tiger O
coexistence O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER

Conservationists O
refer O
to O
a O
concept O
known O
as O
“social O
carrying O
capacity” O
to O
describe O
the O
capacity O
for O
a O
certain O
community O
to O
tolerate O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
animals O
like O
tigers. O

Understanding O
that O
dynamic O
and O
that O
social O
carrying O
capacity O
is O
a O
new O
area O
of O
focus O
for O
us O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Unless O
people O
living O
with O
tigers O
want O
them O
there O
, O
we’re O
not O
gonna O
have O
them O
there O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O

Protecting O
tigers O
also O
helps O
protect O
other O
endangered O
or O
threatened O
species O
. O

Effectively O
, O
if O
we’re O
gonna O
protect O
one O
tiger O
, O
we’re O
gonna O
protect O
10,000 O
hectares O
of O
forest O
, O
” O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Tigers O
also O
live O
in O
“some O
of O
the O
most O
carbon-rich O
forests.” O

It O
will O
“help O
us O
mitigate O
climate O
change O
as O
well O
if O
we O
protect O
these O
very O
rich O
forests O
.” O

But O
while O
Nepal B-LOC
is O
a O
tiger O
success O
story O
, O
Hemley B-PER
pointed O
out O
there O
are O
still O
many O
countries O
where O
tigers O
are O
in O
“ O
crisis O
.” O

Tigers O
have O
gone O
extinct O
in O
Vietnam B-LOC
, O
Cambodia B-LOC
, O
and O
Laos B-LOC
since O
2000 O
, O
she O
said O
. O

We O
have O
to O
look O
at O
the O
elements O
that O
have O
led O
to O
success O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
and O
India B-LOC
and O
try O
to O
get O
them O
replicated O

The O
most O
important O
piece O
of O
it O
is O
political O
will O
and O
political O
leadership O
.” O

The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
also O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
tiger O
conservation O

120 O

150 O
minutes O

Tanzi B-PER
, O
who O
was O

the O

, O
has O
examined O
the O
role O
of O
exercise O
in O
mice O
genetically O

found O
exercise O
induces O
the O
birth O

the O
section O

followed O
296 O

They’re O
fully O

but O
what O
they O
have O
to O
go O
through O

They’re O

to O

in O
the O
early O
stages O
and O
accomplish O
things O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
but O
the O
toll O
is O
immense O
. O
” O

Participants O
in O
the O
study O
underwent O
cognitive O
testing O
and O
then O
were O
randomized O
into O
two O
groups O

One O
group O
did O
moderate-intensity O
aerobic O
training O
on O
treadmills O
or O
stationary O
bikes O
, O
striving O
for O
a O
goal O
of O
70% O
to O
85% O
of O
heart O
rate O
reserve O
: O
“ O
That’s O
about O
120 O
heartbeats O
per O
minute O
for O
about O
30 O
to O
40 O
minutes O
for O
a O
standard O
70-year-old O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O

The O
other O
group O
did O
stretching O
, O
balance O
and O
range O
of O
motion O
exercises O
designed O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
move O
their O
body O
in O
ways O
that O
would O
help O
them O
navigate O
in O
real O
life O
. O

Folks O
in O
the O
balance-range O
of O
motion O
group O
said O
they O
were O
thrilled O
– O
they O
could O
go O
to O
soccer O
games O
with O
grandchildren O
without O
being O
concerned O
about O
tripping O
, O
or O
they O
could O
drive O
and O
turn O
their O
neck O
to O
see O
the O
back O
, O
which O
they O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
before O
, O
” O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O

Importance O
of O
support O
Both O
groups O
exercised O
twice O
a O
week O
with O
a O
personal O
trainer O
and O
then O
two O
other O
times O
weekly O
on O
their O
own O
for O
the O
first O
12 O
months O

Combined O
, O
the O
groups O
completed O
more O
than O
31,000 O
exercise O
sessions O
during O
that O
time O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
12 O
months O
, O
cognitive O
function O
had O
not O
declined O
in O
either O
group O
. O

That’s O
impressive O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
, O
because O
a O
control O
group O
of O
equally O
matched O
people O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
– O
who O
did O
not O
exercise O
– O
did O
decline O

Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
social O
support O
is O
also O
key O
to O
improving O
brain O
health O

So O
is O
it O
possible O
the O
results O
of O
the O
study O
were O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
of O
social O
support O
and O
not O
the O
exercise O
. O

Well, O
we O
don’t O
know O
for O
sure,” O
Baker B-PER
said. O

But O
there O
is O
enough O
science O
showing O
the O
benefits O
of O
exercise O
on O
brain O
health O
alone O

So O
this O
is O
not O
something O
to O
sweep O
under O
the O
carpet O
. O

And O
our O
recommendation O
would O
never O
be O
for O
people O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
to O
do O
this O
alone O
she O
added O

They O
are O
going O
to O
need O
support O

So O
exercise O
alone O
is O
not O
a O
prescription O
. O

Exercise O
with O
support O
is O
a O
prescription O
, O
and O
that O
is O
going O
to O
be O
our O
recommendation O
. O

It O
isn’t O
often O
that O
Democrats B-ORG
look O
to O
deep-red O
Kansas B-LOC
for O
resounding O
affirmation O

But O
on O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
when O
Kansans B-LOC
overwhelmingly O
voted O
to O
keep O
protections O
for O
abortion O
rights O
in O
their O
state O
constitution O
, O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
happened O
. O

The O
size O
and O
scope O
of O
the O
result O
were O
a O
shock O
to O
even O
the O
most O
optimistic O
Democrats B-ORG

Not O
only O
did O
voters O
reject O
a O
proposed O
constitutional O
amendment O
that O
would O
have O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
strict O
abortion O
laws O
in O
the O
Republican O
state O
, O
but O
they O
did O
it O
by O
turning O
out O
in O
huge O
numbers O
, O
dwarfing O
turnout O
in O
more O
recent O
primary O
elections O
and O
signaling O
that O
the O
issue O
can O
motivate O
even O
Republican-leaning O
voters O
in O
a O
state O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
won O
by O
15 O
points O
in O
2020 O
. O

The O
political O
impact O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
will O
be O
most O
directly O
felt O
in O
the O
November O
midterm O
elections O
– O
particularly O
in O
races O
for O
governor O
and O
attorney O
general O
after O
the O
US B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
overturned O
Roe O
v. O
Wade O
, O
throwing O
the O
issue O
of O
abortion O
to O
the O
states O
. O

The O
June O
ruling O
has O
led O
to O
bans O
on O
the O
procedure O
being O
enforced O
in O
several O
states O
while O
opening O
the O
door O
to O
more O
restrictions O
in O
others O

At O
least O
four O
other O
states B-LOC
will O
be O
voting O
on O
abortion-related O
ballot O
measures O
this O
November O
, O
but O
Democratic B-ORG
strategists O
are O
looking O
to O
the O
Kansas B-LOC
result O
to O
extrapolate O
lessons O
for O
states O
where O
abortion O
won’t O
be O
on O
the O
ballot O
. O

As O
the O
first O
state O
to O
vote O
on O
abortion O
rights O
following O
the O
fall O
of O
Roe B-ORG
v. I-ORG
Wade I-ORG
, O
Kansas B-LOC
is O
a O
model O
for O
a O
path O
to O
restoring O
reproductive O
rights O
across O
the O
country O
through O
direct O
democracy O

Alexis B-PER
McGill I-PER
Johnson I-PER
, O

We O
know O
that O
Kansas B-LOC
will O
not O
be O
our O
last O
fight O
, O
or O
our O
last O
victory O
. O

Democratic O
and O
Republican O
operatives O
acknowledged O
Wednesday O
that O
the O
result O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
, O
while O
limited O
to O
one O
state O
, O
could O
shift O
the O
way O
each O
party O
approaches O
the O
midterms O

Democrats B-ORG
, O
buoyed O
by O
polling O
and O
the O
Kansas B-LOC
result O
, O
will O
likely O
attempt O
to O
make O
abortion O
a O
top O
issue O
in O
key O
races O
, O
hoping O
to O
link O
their O
Republican B-ORG
opponents O
to O
the O
support O
for O
stricter O
abortion O
laws O
. O

Republicans O
, O
likewise O
, O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
cautious O
on O
the O
issue O
, O
largely O
ignoring O
their O
party’s O
long-held O
desire O
to O
tighten O
abortion O
laws O
across O
the O
country O
and O
instead O
hoping O
to O
keep O
the O
focus O
on O
the O
economy O
. O

I O
think O
our O
Republican O
candidates O
are O
going O
to O
keep O
focusing O
on O
the O
issues O
most O
important O
to O
voters O
, O
and O
every O
poll O
keeps O
saying O
that O
is O
rising O
costs O
and O
the O
economy O
,” O
said O
a O
Republican O
operative O
working O
on O
House O
races O
. O

A O
GOP O
operative O
working O
on O
Senate B-ORG
races O
added O
: O
“ O
The O
midterms O
are O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
a O
vacuum O
, O
and O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
that O
voters O
are O
considering O
when O
they O
cast O
their O
ballot O
in O
the O
fall O
.” O

It O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
an O
up-or-down O
vote O
on O
one O
issue O
.” O

Democrats O
were O
more O
hopeful O
that O
the O
Kansas B-LOC
result O
was O
a O
positive O
sign O
for O
the O
party’s O
midterm O
prospects O
, O
amid O
low O
approval O
ratings O
for O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
and O
rising O
inflation O
and O
other O
economic O
concerns O
. O

We O
already O
knew O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
Americans B-LOC
support O
abortion O
rights O
, O
but O
last O
night’s O
results O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
showed O
us O
that O
it’s O
also O
a O
motivating O
factor O
for O
voters O
, O

Interactive I-ORG
. O

We’ll O
likely O
see O
more O
Democratic O
candidates O
learn O
from O
Kansas B-LOC
and O
lean O
in O
on O
the O
threat O
and O
urgency O
of O
abortion O
bans O
across O
the O
country O
and O
start O
communicating O
that O
directly O
to O
voters O
. O

The O
results O
across O
the O
country O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
however O
, O
also O
highlighted O
a O
complicated O
relationship O
between O
voters O
and O
abortion O
. O

While O
Kansas B-LOC
voters O
resoundingly O
rejected O
the O
abortion O
amendment O
, O
Republican B-ORG
primary O
voters O
in O
places O
such O
as O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
Michigan B-LOC
and O
Missouri B-LOC
also O
nominated O
candidates O
for O
governor O
, O
US B-ORG
senator O
and O
other O
top O
positions O
who O
support O
enacting O
stricter O
abortion O
restrictions O
. O

Republicans B-ORG
look O
for O
footing O
on O
abortion O
issue O
Since O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court’s I-ORG
decision O
in O
June O
, O
many O
Republicans B-ORG
have O
been O
attempting O
to O
walk O
a O
fine O
line O
on O
abortion O
. O

Pennsylvania B-LOC
gubernatorial O
nominee O
Doug B-PER
Mastriano I-PER
is O
one O
of O
the O
clearest O
examples O
. O

While O
running O
in O
the O
commonwealth’s O
GOP B-ORG
primary O
, O
Mastriano B-PER
called O
abortion O
his O
“No O
. O

1 O
issue O
.” O

Since O
winning O
the O
nomination O
, O
he O
has O
been O
less O
emphatic O
, O
instead O
arguing O
that O
it’s O
the O
“people O
of O
Pennsylvania” B-LOC
who O
will O
decide O
the O
future O
of O
abortion O
in O
the O
state O
. O

In O
a O
statement O
after O
the O
June O
ruling O
, O
Mastriano B-PER
– O
a O
state O
senator O
who O
has O
backed O
and O
sponsored O
strict O
anti-abortion O

– O
said O
Republicans O
“ O
must O
not O
take O
our O
focus O
away O
from O
the O
key O
issues O
facing O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
families O
.” O

And O
Mastriano B-PER
is O
not O
alone O
as O
Republicans B-ORG
across O
the O
country O
try O
to O
keep O
the O
focus O
on O
sky-high O
inflation O
and O
voters’ O
sense O
of O
economic O
malaise O
instead O
of O
more O
controversial O
issues O
like O
abortion O

The O
National B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Senatorial I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
put O
out O
a O
memo O
following O
the O
May O

of O
a O
draft O
opinion O
that O
foretold O
the O
Supreme B-ORG

urging O
candidates O
to O
“ O
be O
the O
compassionate O

disagree O
with O
them O
on O
the O
issue O

A O
Republican O
operative O
working O

said O
that O
while O
the O
Kansas B-LOC
result O
“reflects O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
more O
nuance O
in O
the O
politics O
of O
abortion O
than O
most O
people O
realize,” O
the O
NRSC B-ORG
has O
been O
advising O
candidates O
to O
“make O
up O
their O
minds O
how O
much O
they O
want O
to O
talk O

the O

to O

want O

make O
it O
about O
the O
issues O
that O
are O
impacting O
their O
lives O
day O
to O
day,” O
like O
the O
economy. O

Some O
Republicans B-ORG
also O
believe O
a O
focus O
on O
abortion O
would O
allow O
Republicans B-ORG
to O
go O
on O
offense O
against O
Democrats B-ORG
who O
oppose O

You O

that O
the O
Supreme B-ORG

broadly O
unpopular O

that O

55% O

But O
the O

the O

real O
world O
test O

that O
support O
in O
an O
era O
without O
the O

and O
the O
result O
points O
to O
not O
just O
the O
accuracy O
of O
recent O

to O
how O
voters O
– O
even O
in O
a O

are O
energized O
over O
the O

what O

prosecutors O
say O
the O
parents O
of O
accused O
Oxford B-LOC
High I-LOC
School I-LOC
shooter O
Ethan B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
exposed O
him O
to O
years O
of O
chaotic O
, O
toxic O
conflict O
, O
and O
that O
they O
left O
him O
in O
an O
unstable O
home O
often O
with O
little O
supervision O
, O
creating O
a O
pathway O
to O
violence O
. O

In O
a O
court O
filing O
Thursday O
, O
prosecutors O
argued O
that O
evidence O
of O
Jennifer B-PER

James B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
’s O
personal O
problems O
, O
including O
an O
extramarital O
affair O
and O
substance O
abuse O
, O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
be O
introduced O
at O
their O
trial O
. O

Attorneys O
for O
the O
couple O
have O
called O
the O
evidence O
“extraneous.” O

The O
parents O
were O
each O
charged O
with O
four O
counts O
of O
involuntary O
manslaughter O
after O
their O
teenage O
son O
allegedly O
shot O
and O
killed O
four O
students O
and O
injured O
seven O
other O
people O
at O
Oxford B-LOC
High I-LOC
School I-LOC
in O
November O

Prosecutors O
argued O
that O
Jennifer B-PER
and O
James B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
played O
“ O
a O
much O
larger O
role O
than O
just O
buying O
their O
son O
a O
gun O
,” O
and O
that O
there O
were O
many O
things O
the O
parents O
could O
have O
done O
, O
other O
than O
simply O
locking O
up O
the O
gun O
, O
that O
could O
have O
prevented O
the O
tragedy O
. O

They O
also O
argued O
the O
parents O
had O
“every O
reason” O
to O
know O
their O
son O
was O
dangerous. O

What O
the O
evidence O
will O
actually O
show O
is O
that O
these O
defendants O
exposed O
their O
son O
to O
years O
of O
chaotic O
toxic O
conflict O
, O
which O
is O
a O
well-known O
risk O
factor O
for O
entering O
the O
pathway O
to O
violence O
, O
” O
the O

The O
investigation O
paints O
a O
clear O
picture O
of O
parents O
who O
were O
not O
just O
in O
constant O
conflict O
, O
or O
who O
just O
exposed O
their O
son O
to O
conflict O
, O
but O
who O
actively O
inserted O
him O
into O
their O
conflict O
… O
Investigators O
have O
interviewed O
witnesses O
from O
across O
the O
country O
who O
interacted O
with O
the O

far O
back O
as O
when O
Ethan B-PER
was O
in O
kindergarten O
, O
the O

Neighbors O

told O

that O
the O
parents O
would O
consistently O
fight O
and O
drink O
to O
excess O
, O
often O
leaving O
Ethan B-PER
unsupervised O
. O

Evidence O
also O
shows O
the O
parents O
spent O
thousands O
of O
dollars O
on O
alcohol O
and O
care O
for O
horses O
and O
negligible O
amounts O
on O

Ethan B-PER
felt O

said O

My O

my O

Prosecutors O
also O
allege O
that O
when O
Ethan B-PER
was O
six O
, O
his O
mother O
took O
him O
to O
stay O
the O

with O
a O

she O
was O

an O

left O
him O

When O
he O
was O
older O

prosecutors O
said O

Jennifer B-PER

James B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
would O
ask O
their O

When O
Ethan B-PER
went O
through O
stretches O
of O
poor O
sleep O
or O
insomnia O
, O
he O
“complained O
of O
seeing O
demons O

asked O
for O

” O
but O
his O
parents O
ignored O
him O

prosecutors O
said O

Their O
son O
was O
deteriorating O

he O
went O
through O

that O
shared O
a O

with O
the O
shooter’s O

prosecutors O
said O

Witnesses O
also O
told O
investigators O
the O
parents O
were O
“routinely O
intoxicated” O
in O

that O

( O
ASPR B-ORG

, O
an O

One O
of O
the O
most O
powerful O
volcanic O
eruptions O
on O
the O

blasted O
such O
a O
massive O
amount O
of O
water O

high O
into O
the O

that O
it’s O
likely O
to O
temporarily O
warm O

When O
the O
undersea O
Hunga B-LOC
Tonga-Hunga I-LOC
Ha’apai I-LOC
volcano O
erupted O
on O
January O
15 O
, O
40 O
miles O
( O
65 O
kilometers O
) O
north O
of O
Tonga’s B-LOC
capital O
, O
it O
created O
a O
tsunami O
as O
well O
as O
a O
sonic O
boom O
that O
rippled O
around O
the O
world O
– O
twice O

The O
eruption O
sent O
a O
tall O
plume O
of O
water O
vapor O
into O
the O
stratosphere O
, O
which O
is O
located O
between O
8 O
and O
33 O
miles O
( O
12 O
and O
53 O
kilometers O
) O
above O
the O
Earth’s O
surface O
. O

It O
was O
enough O
water O
to O
fill O
58,000 O
Olympic-sized O
swimming O
pools O
, O
according O
to O
detections O
from O
a O
NASA B-ORG
satellite O

The O

was O
made O
by O
the O
Microwave B-ORG

After O
the O
eruption O
occurred O
, O
the O
scientists O
were O
surprised O
by O
the O
water O
vapor O
readings O
. O

They O
estimate O
that O
the O
eruption O
delivered O
146 O
teragrams O
of O
water O
to O
the O
stratosphere O

One O
teragram O
is O
the O
equivalent O
of O
a O
trillion O
grams O
, O
and O
in O
this O
case O
, O
it O
was O
equal O
to O
10% O
of O
the O
water O
already O
present O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
. O

That’s O
nearly O
four O
times O
the O
amount O

We O
had O
to O
carefully O

by O
the O

” O
Millán B-PER
said O
. O

The O
Aura O
satellite O
launched O
in O
2004 O
and O
since O
then O
it O
has O
only O
measured O
two O
volcanic O
eruptions O
that O
lofted O
substantial O
water O
vapor O
so O
high O
up O
in O
the O
atmosphere O

But O
the O
water O
vapor O
from O
the O
2008 O
Kasatochi O
event O
in O
Alaska B-LOC
and O
the O
2015 O
Calbuco O
eruption O
in O
Chile B-LOC
dissipated O
rather O
quickly O

Typically O
, O
powerful O
volcanic O
eruptions O
like O
Mount B-LOC
Pinatubo I-LOC
or O
the O
1883 O
Krakatoa B-LOC
event O
in O
Indonesia B-LOC
cool O
Earth’s O
surface O
temperature O
because O
the O
gas O
, O
dust O
and O
ash O
they O
spew O
reflects O
sunlight O
into O
space O
. O

This O
volcanic O
winter O
happened O
after O
the O
Mount B-LOC
Tambora I-LOC
eruption O
in O
1815 O
, O
triggering O
the O
year O
without O
a O
summer O
in O
1816 O
. O

The O
Tonga B-LOC
eruption O
was O
different O
because O
the O
water O
vapor O
it O
sent O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
can O
trap O
heat O
which O
could O
cause O
warmer O
surface O
temperatures O

The O
excess O
water O
vapor O
could O
stay O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
for O
several O
years O
, O
according O
to O
the O
researchers O
. O

The O
additional O
water O
vapor O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
could O
also O
lead O
to O
chemical O
reactions O
that O
temporarily O
contribute O
to O
the O
depletion O
of O
Earth’s O
protective O
ozone O

Anatomy O
of O
an O
eruption O
Fortunately O
, O
the O
warming O
effect O
of O
the O
water O
vapor O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
small O
and O
temporary O
, O
and O
will O
dissipate O
as O
the O
extra O
vapor O
diminishes O

The O
researchers O
don’t O
believe O
it O
will O
be O
enough O
to O
exacerbate O
existing O
conditions O
due O
to O
the O
climate O
crisis O

The O
researchers O
believe O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
lofted O
water O
vapor O
was O
due O
to O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
volcano’s O
caldera O
490 O
feet O
( O
150 O
meters O
) O
below O
the O
ocean’s O
surface O

If O
it O
was O
too O
deep O
, O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
ocean O
would O
have O
muted O
the O
eruption O
, O
and O
it O
was O
too O
shallow O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
seawater O
heated O
by O
the O
erupting O
magma O
wouldn’t O
have O
matched O
what O
reached O
the O
stratosphere O
, O
the O
researchers O
said O
. O

Scientists O
are O
still O
working O
to O
understand O
the O
unusually O
energetic O
eruption O
and O
all O
of O
its O
superlatives O
, O
including O
hurricane-strength O
winds O

a O
confidential O
version O
of O
the O
answer O
last O
week O
to O
give O
Twitter B-ORG

time O
to O

it O
for O
company O
information O
that O
should O
be O
redacted O
, O
before O
making O
it O
publicly O

Friday O
) O

Taylor B-PER
called O
Musk’s B-PER
claims O
“factually O
inaccurate, O
legally O
insufficient, O
and O
commercially O
irrelevant.” O

In O
its O
response O
, O
Twitter B-ORG
takes O
issue O
with O
Musk’s B-PER
analysis O
of O
spam O
bots O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
“firehose” O
of O
data O
he O
used O
“reflects O
many O
Twitter B-ORG
accounts O
that O
are O
not O
included O
in O
mDAU O
” O
and O
that O
the O
Botometer B-ORG
tool O
he O
used O
relies O
on O
a O
different O
process O
than O
the O
company O
to O
determine O
whether O
an O
account O
may O
be O
a O
bot O
. O

It O
added O
that O
Botometer B-ORG
“ O
earlier O
this O
year O
designed O
Musk O
himself O
as O
highly O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
bot O
.” O

The O
back-and-forth O
between O
Twitter B-ORG
and O
Musk B-PER
offers O
a O
preview O
of O
the O
arguments O
each O
side O
will O
make O
when O
the O
case O
goes O
to O
trial O
, O
assuming O
they O
don’t O
agree O
to O
a O
settlement O
first O
. O

A O
five-day O
trial O
is O
set O
to O
kick O
off O
on O
October O
17 O
, O
after O
Twitter B-ORG
had O
pressed O
to O
expedite O
the O
proceedings O
. O

Musk O
last O
month O
moved O
to O
terminate O
his O
agreement O
to O
buy O
Twitter B-ORG
, O
accusing O
the O
company O
of O
breaching O
the O
deal O
by O
making O
misleading O
statements O
about O
the O
number O
of O
bot O
accounts O
on O
its O
platform O
and O
withholding O
information O
that O
he O
claims O
could O
help O
him O
evaluate O
the O
issue O
. O

Days O
later O
, O
Twitter B-ORG
filed O
a O
lawsuit O
against O
the O
billionaire O
, O
alleging O
that O
he’d O
violated O
the O
agreement O
and O
asking O
a O
court O
to O
compel O
him O
to O
follow O
through O
with O
the O
deal O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
doubling O
down O
on O
concerns O
about O
bot O
accounts O
, O
Musk’s B-PER
responses O
also O
criticized O
Twitter’s B-ORG
use O
of O
monetizable O
daily O
active O
users O
, O
a O
metric O
Twitter B-ORG
publicly O
reports O
to O
advertisers O
and O
shareholders O
to O
represent O
its O
growth O
. O

Musk B-PER
claims O
that O
his O
evaluations O
show O
only O
a O
small O
portion O
of O
the O
users O
Twitter B-ORG
considers O
mDAU O
actually O
generate O
significant O
revenue O
for O
the O
company O
by O
viewing O
and O
engaging O
with O
advertisements O
, O
alleging O
that O
the O
measure O
is O
not O
actually O
as O
good O
an O
indicator O
of O
future O
revenue O
growth O
potential O
and O
long-term O
performance O
as O
Twitter’s B-ORG
public O
filings O
imply O
. O

“ O
Twitter B-ORG
also O
does O
not O
publish O
the O
methodology O
it O
follows O
to O
determine O
its O
mDAU O
count O
, O
or O
how O
it O
excludes O
nonmonetizable O
accounts O
from O
that O
metric O
, O
” O
Musk B-PER
’s O
answer O
states O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
difficult O
for O
any O
third O
party O
to O
completely O
recreate O
Twitter’s B-ORG
mDAU O
calculations O
. O

Musk’s O
answer O
alleges O
Twitter B-ORG
leadership O
has O
incentives O
to O
report O
“high O
mDAU O
numbers O
to O
stoke O
investor O
interest” O
and O
because O
its O
executive O
compensation O
structure O
is O
based O
partly O
on O
mDAU. O

In O
its O
answer O
, O
Musk’s B-PER
team O
explains O
that O
the O
billionaire O
is O
concerned O
with O
the O
spam O
bot O
issue O
because O
“ O
transitioning O
users O
who O
do O
not O
generate O
any O
revenue O
into O
more O
active O
users O
… O
is O
no O
easy O
task O
. O
” O

Musk’s O
team O
adds O
: O
“ O
A O
company O
focused O
on O
adding O
these O
active O
users O
would O
invest O
substantial O
resources O
towards O
trying O
to O
improve O
Twitter B-ORG
to O
maximize O
engagement O
, O
such O
as O
by O
effectively O
targeting O
spam O
or O
false O
accounts O
. O
” O

Twitter B-ORG
said O
in O
its O
response O
to O
Musk’s B-PER
counterclaims O
that O
its O
mDAU O
count O
has O
never O
purported O
to O
show O
how O
many O
users O
generate O
significant O
revenue O
by O
interacting O
with O
ads O
, O
but O
rather O
shows O
the O
number O
of O
real O
users O
who O
could O
be O
monetized O
by O
being O
shown O
ads O
. O

It O
also O
noted O
that O
Musk’s B-PER
mDAU-related O
claims O
were O
not O
included O
in O
his O
initial O
termination O
filing O
and O
“are O
a O
newly O
invented O
litigating O
position.” O

The O
company O
also O
continues O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
issue O
of O
bots O
is O
not O
, O
and O
has O
never O
been O
, O
germane O
to O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
acquisition O
deal O
. O

Musk O
has O
received O
massive O
amounts O
of O
information O
from O
Twitter B-ORG
, O
for O
months O
, O
and O
has O
been O
unable O
to O
find O
a O
valid O
excuse O
to O
back O
out O
of O
the O
contract O
, O
” O
Twitter’s B-ORG
response O
states O
. O

In O
a O

that O
was O
included O
in O
Friday’s O

, O
Twitter B-ORG
General O

Sean B-PER

that O
while O

had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
request O
redactions O
in O
Musk’s O

, O
it O
chose O
not O

Twitter B-ORG
had O
previously O
sent O
a O
letter O
to O
the O

asking O
her O
to O
ensure O

they O
would O
have O
enough O
time O

it O

But O
not O
this O
time O

The O
FBI B-ORG
’s O
Monday O
morning O
search O
of O
Mar-a-Lago B-LOC
– O
a O
thunderclap O
in O
American B-LOC
political O
history O
– O
happened O
so O
quietly O
, O
so O
secretly O
, O
that O
it O
wasn’t O
caught O
on O

at O
all O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
reporters O
didn’t O
catch O
wind O
of O
the O
FBI B-ORG
action O
until O
after O
it O
was O
over O

By O
the O
time O
local O
TV O
news O
cameras O
showed O
up O
outside O
the O
club O
, O
there O
was O
almost O
nothing O

of O
the O
Florida B-LOC

since O
there O
were O
no O
dramatic O
shots O
of O
the O
search O

What O
everyone O
wants O
to O
see O
is O
the O
search O
warrant O

As O
Elie B-PER
Honig I-PER
pointed O
out O
right O
away O
on O
CNN B-ORG
, O
“ O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
search O
warrant O
in O
the O
federal O
system O
, O
prosecutors O
have O
to O
establish O
probable O
cause O
that O
a O
crime O
was O
committed O
, O
” O
and O
a O
judge O
has O
to O
sign O
off O
. O

The O
warrant O
may O
become O
public O
later O

But O
for O
the O
time O
being O
we’re O
only O
seeing O
leaks O
from O
anonymous O
sources O
; O
interpretations O
from O
analysts O
; O
and O
incendiary O
responses O
from O
Trump B-PER
family O
members O

Mark B-PER
Levin I-PER
said O
on O

that O
“this O
is O
the O
worst O
attack O
on O
this O
republic O
in O
modern O
history O
, O
period O
. O

The O
hyperbolic O
, O
man-the-battle-stations O
reactions O
are O
a O
big O
part O
of O
the O
story O
because O
they O
showcase O

solidly O
right O
next O
to O
Trump B-PER
regardless O
of O

First O
four O
hours O
of O
coverage O
This O
feels O
like O
a O
“where O
were O
you O
when?” O

moment O
of O
the O
Trump B-ORG
era O
– O
an O
era O
that O
is O
very O
much O
overlapping O
with O
the O
Biden B-ORG
era O

But O
its O
ultimate O
level O
of O
import O
is O
impossible O
to O

right O

So O
here O
are O
some O
notes O
about O
the O
first O
four O
hours O
of O

coverage O
: O
– O
Trump B-PER
tried O
to O
manage O
the O

by O
announcing O
it O
himself O
in O
a O
lengthy O
screed O

Trump B-PER
and O
some O
of O

“have O
a O

Maggie B-PER

it’s O

an O
hour O

Symptoms O
of O
vasculitis O
Vasculitis O
occurs O
when O
the O
body’s O
immune O
system O
attacks O
veins O
, O
arteries O
and O
small O
capillaries O
. O

The O
resulting O
inflammation O
narrows O
those O
blood O
vessels O
and O
restricts O
the O
flow O
of O
blood O
or O
even O
cuts O
blood O
flow O
off O
entirely O
, O
possibly O
causing O
organ O
damage O
or O
creating O
aneurysms O
( O
a O
bulge O
in O
the O
wall O
of O
a O
blood O
vessel O
) O
, O
according O
to O
the O
National B-ORG
Institutes I-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
. O

If O
an O
aneurysm O
bursts O
, O
it O
can O
cause O
internal O
bleeding O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
death O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
specific O
type O
and O
severity O
of O
the O
condition O
and O
which O
organs O
are O
targeted O
, O
symptoms O
of O
vasculitis O
vary O
and O
can O
be O
mild O
, O
moderate O
or O
life-threatening O
. O

Common O
symptoms O
include O
loss O
of O
appetite O
, O
weight O
loss O
, O
fatigue O
, O
rash O
, O
aches O
, O
pains O
and O
fever O
. O

Age O
, O
ethnicity O
, O
family O
history O
and O
lifestyle O
factors O
such O
as O
smoking O
and O
illegal O
drug O
use O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
risk O
for O
vasculitis O
. O

Certain O
medications O
for O
high O
blood O
pressure O
, O
thyroid O
disease O
and O
infections O
can O
contribute O
as O
well O
, O
the O
NIH O
noted O
. O

Vasculitis O
can O
occur O
alone O
or O
in O
conjunction O
with O
other O
rheumatic O
diseases O
, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
, O
lupus O
or O
scleroderma O
. O

Having O
a O
hepatitis O
B O
or O
C O
infection O
can O
also O
be O
a O
trigger O
, O
as O
can O
blood O
cancers O
such O
as O
leukemia O
and O
lymphoma O
. O

Treatment O
is O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
inflammation O

For O
mild O
cases O
, O
over-the-counter O
pain O
medicines O
can O
help O

For O
more O
severe O
cases O

However O
, O
it’s O

CNN B-ORG
has O
previously O
reported O
on O
Pompeo’s O
negotiations O
with O
the O
committee O
about O
his O
testimony O

The O

shown O
an O
increased O
interest O
in O
members O
of O
former O

Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER

regarding O

and O
the O

focus O
in O
the O
Pompeo B-PER

was O
expected O
to O
be O
on O
the O
25th O

, O
the O
source O
said O
. O

A O
portion O
of O
the O
25th O
Amendment O
, O
which O
addresses O
presidential O
succession O
, O
allows O
a O
vice O
president O
and O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
Cabinet O
to O
vote O
to O
remove O
a O
president O
from O
office O
due O
to O
his O
inability O
to O
“discharge O
the O
powers O
and O
duties O
of O
his O
office O
.” O

Pompeo B-PER
served O
as O
CIA B-ORG
director O
for O
the O
first O
year O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
presidency O
, O
and O
led O
the O
State B-ORG

for O
Trump’s B-PER
final O
three O
years O
, O
where O
he O
was O
a O

Lofgren O
refused O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
particulars O
of O
Pompeo’s O
testimony O
in O
an O
interview O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
but O
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Wolf B-PER
Blitzer I-PER
on O
“ O
The O

” O
that O
“ O
he O
came O
in O
willingly O

and O
he O
did O
answer O
questions O
for O
quite O
some O
time O

When O
asked O
if O
the O
committee O
learned O
any O
new O
information O
from O
Pompeo’s B-PER
testimony O
, O
Lofgren B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
I O
think O
we O
fill O
in O
a O
few O
pieces O
here O
and O
there O
each O
time O
we O

someone O

Obviously, O
we’ve O
had O
testimony O
from O
others O
about O
what O
he O
said O

did. O

And O
so O
it’s O
just O
a O

out O
the O

the O

Why O
the O
‘dollar O
smile’ O
leads O
to O
frowns O
The O
US B-LOC
dollar O
tends O
to O
climb O
in O
value O
when O
America’s B-LOC
economy O
is O
very O
strong O
, O
or O
, O
somewhat O
counterintuitively O
, O
when O
it’s O
weak O
and O
the O
world O
is O
facing O
a O
recession O
. O

In O
either O
situation O
, O
investors O
view O
the O
country’s O
currency O
as O
an O
opportunity O
to O
lock O
in O
growth O
, O
or O
as O
a O
relatively O
secure O
place O
to O
park O
cash O
while O
they O
ride O
out O
the O
storm O
. O

The O
phenomenon O
is O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
“dollar O
smile,” O
since O
it O
rises O
at O
both O
extremes. O

But O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
is O
left O
with O
less O
to O
grin O
about O

Manik B-PER
Narain I-PER
, O
head O
of O
cross-asset O
strategy O
for O
emerging O
markets O
at O
UBS B-ORG
, O
identified O
three O
main O
reasons O
that O
a O
stronger O
dollar O
could O
hurt O
countries O
around O
the O
world O
with O
smaller O
economies O
. O

1 O

It O
can O
add O
fiscal O
strain O

Not O
every O
country O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
borrow O
money O
in O
their O
local O
currency O
, O
since O
foreign O
investors O
may O
not O
have O
faith O
in O
their O
institutions O
or O
they O
have O
less O
developed O
financial O
markets O
. O

That O
means O
some O
have O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
issue O
debt O
denominated O
in O
dollars O

But O
if O
the O
value O
of O
the O
dollar O
shoots O
up O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
more O
expensive O
to O
repay O
their O
liabilities O
, O
draining O
government O
coffers O
. O

It O
also O
makes O
it O
costlier O
for O
governments O
or O
businesses O
to O
import O
food O
, O
medicine O
and O
fuel O
. O

That’s O
what O
happened O
when O
the O
value O
of O
Sri B-LOC
Lanka’s I-LOC
rupee O
crashed O
against O
the O
dollar O
earlier O
this O
year O

The O
government O
drained O
its O
foreign O
reserves O
, O
which O
were O
already O
low O
in O
part O
due O
to O
a O
slump O
in O
tourism O
during O
the O

When O
a O

dramatically O
weakens O

wealthy O

and O
foreign O
investors O
start O
withdrawing O
their O
money O
, O
hoping O
to O
stash O
it O
somewhere O
safer O
. O

That O
pushes O
the O
currency O
down O
even O
lower O
, O
exacerbating O
fiscal O
problems O
. O

If O
you’re O
sitting O
in O
Sri B-LOC

the O
moment O
and O
you’re O

they O
need O
to O

their O

, O
they O
won’t O

they O
won’t O
be O

sell O
as O
much O
, O
even O
if O

robust O

When O
the O

that O

some O
of O
the O

Many O

when O

That’s O
tough O

Disappointment O

much O

of O
an O

The O
former O

came O
out O
with O
a O
statement O
earlier O
this O
month O
saying O
he O
would O
not O
back O
Hartzler O

a O

But O
her O
lack O
of O

seem O
to O

even O
those O
who O

made O
up O
their O

I O
thought O

well O
, O
yeah O
, O
because O
they’re O
not O
the O

But O
that O
doesn’t O

It O
goes O
over O

Hartzler B-PER

even O
if O
they O

I O
know O

considering O
an O

I’d O
love O
to O
have O
it,” O
Schmitt B-PER
told O
reporters O
Wednesday O
in O

He O
added O
that O
he O
wouldn’t O
support O
Mitch B-PER
McConnell I-PER
for O
Senate O

– O
an O
appeal O
to O
Trump B-PER

his O

instead O

Mike B-PER
Lee I-PER
, O
both O

that’s O
a O
pledge O
Greitens B-PER
had O
already O
made O
, O
and O
one O
that O
Hartzler B-PER
soon O
made O
too O

The O
Marine O

is O
running O
a O
populist O
campaign O
, O
on O
the O
premise O
that O
a O

can O
win O
Missouri B-LOC
by O
picking O
off O

out O

Even O
though O
she O
comes O
from O
the O
Anheuser B-ORG

it O
seems O
that O
she O
has O

Not O
all O

adds O
an O
element O
of O

to O

Neither O

admit O
last O

Two O

suggested O
his O
omission O
of O
a O

Afterward O

both O
Greitens B-PER

Schmitt B-PER
sought O
to O
lay O

Greitens B-PER

Basically O
everyone O

doing O
it O

so O
you’d O
think O
it O
would O
be O
tempting O
for O
Tito’s B-ORG

to O
enter O
the O
canned O
cocktail O
craze O

Instead, O
they’re O
doing O
the O
complete O
opposite. O

The O
vodka O
brand O
is O
selling O
a O
completely O
empty O
can O
that O
encourages O
customers O
to O
make O
canned O
cocktails O
however O
they O
like O
them O
, O
preferably O
with O
Tito’s O
vodka O
. O

Tito’s O
in O
a O
Can” O
is O
just O
that…almost: O
It’s O
a O
16-ounce, O
refillable O
can O
that O
costs O
$20 O
that’s O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
cheeky O
knock O
at O
the O
ever-growing O
cocktail-to-go O
trend. O

Despite O
the O
flood O
of O
different O

and O

, O
we’ve O
always O
believed O
the O
idea O
of O

been O
asking O

to O
enter O

, O
Berry B-PER
said O

The O
brand O
has O
so O
far O
resisted O

and O
Berry’s B-PER
said O
that’s O
because O
Tito’s O
would O
rather O
focus O
on O
simply O
making O

We’ve O
been O
around O

a O
quarter-century O

and O
there’s O

a O

[ O

] O
holding O
true O
to O
what O
we O
know O
and O
the O
strategy O
we’ve O
had O
from O
the O
beginning O
— O
making O
vodka O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

There’s O
an O
element O
of O
this O
brand O
not O
being O
sellouts O
. O

We’ve O
all O
experienced O
it O
before O

You O
go O
to O
rent O
a O
car O
and O
you’re O
handed O
a O
laundry O
list O
of O
coverage O
options O
— O
all O
with O
a O
price O
tag O
attached O

You O
want O
to O
ensure O
you’re O
covered O
, O
but O
you O
also O
aren’t O
looking O
forward O
to O
spending O
even O
more O
on O
your O
car O
rental O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there’s O
often O
a O
different O
option O
: O
your O
credit O
card O
travel O
insurance O
. O

There O
are O
many O
credit O
cards O
that O
will O
actually O
provide O
you O
with O
car O
rental O
coverage O
as O
long O
as O
you O
use O
the O
card O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
rental O

This O
largely O
unknown O
perk O
could O
in O
fact O
save O
you O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
money O
on O
your O
next O
car O
rental O

Additionally O
, O
some O
credit O
cards O
even O
offer O
special O
perks O
, O
such O
as O
car O
rental O
elite O
status O
and O
discounts O
. O

But O
not O
all O
credit O
cards O
offer O
coverage O
, O
and O
some O
offer O
better O
coverage O
than O
others O
. O

So O
before O
you O
rent O
your O
next O
car O
— O
whether O
it’s O
on O
vacation O
or O
just O
around O
town O
— O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
best O
credit O
card O
in O
your O
pocket O
to O
ensure O
you’re O
covered O

Best O
credit O
cards O
for O
car O
rentals O
in O
2022 O
How O
does O
credit O
card O
car O
rental O
insurance O
work O
? O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
when O
renting O
a O
car O
, O
you O
must O
pay O
for O
your O
rental O
with O
the O
specific O
credit O
card O
that O
offers O
car O
rental O
protection O
. O

And, O
if O
there O
are O
multiple O
drivers O
on O
the O
rental O
contract, O
the O
primary O
renter O
must O
be O
the O
card O
holder. O

Additionally O
, O
for O
the O
credit O
card O
coverage O
to O
take O
effect O
in O
the O
unfortunate O
case O
that O
an O
accident O
occurs O
, O
you O
must O
decline O
the O
Collision O
Damage O
Waiver O
( O
CDW O
) O
— O
sometimes O
called O
Loss O
Damage O
Waiver O
( O
LDW O
) O
— O
in O
your O
rental O
agreement O
. O

You O
might O
find O
that O
some O
car O
rental O
companies O
automatically O
include O
this O
extra O
insurance O
— O
and O
cost O
— O
into O
your O
agreement O
, O
so O
you’ll O
want O
to O
double-check O
your O
paperwork O
. O

Once O
you O
rent O
the O
car O
, O
you’ll O
then O
be O
covered O
if O
your O
rented O
car O
incurs O
theft O
or O
damage O
from O
a O
collision O
. O

This O
coverage O
will O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
financial O
responsibility O
of O
covering O
the O
cost O

However O
, O
the O
included O
policy O
will O
not O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
cost O
of O
damage O
or O
injuries O
to O
another O
car O
if O
you’re O
found O
at O
fault O
. O

Typically O
, O
your O
personal O
car O
rental O
insurance O
will O
cover O
you O
in O
these O
situations O
or O
you O
can O
purchase O
separate O
policies O
from O
the O
car O
rental O
company O
. O

You’ll O
also O
notice O
that O
there O
are O
two O
different O
types O
of O
credit O
card O
car O
rental O
coverage O
: O
primary O
and O
secondary O

Primary O
coverage O
means O
that O
if O
there’s O
a O
covered O
accident O
, O
the O
claim O
will O
go O
directly O
through O
the O
credit O
card O
company O
, O
allowing O
you O
to O
avoid O
the O
hassle O
of O
involving O
your O
own O
auto O
insurance O
policy O
. O

This O
will O
not O
only O
save O
you O
time O
but O
will O
also O
avoid O
any O
premiums O
to O
your O
own O
policy O

If O
the O
credit O
card O
offers O
secondary O
car O
rental O
insurance O
, O
you’ll O
have O
to O
first O
make O
a O
claim O
with O
any O
other O
policy O
you O
have O
. O

Once O
the O
claim O
is O
settled O
, O
you O
can O
then O
file O
a O
claim O
with O
your O
credit O
card O
and O
you’ll O
be O
covered O
for O
anything O
that O
wasn’t O
initially O
covered O
with O
your O
primary O
policy O
, O
such O
as O
your O
deductible O
. O

However O
, O
one O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
many O
credit O
cards O
that O
offer O
secondary O
coverage O
switch O
to O
primary O
coverage O
if O
you O
don’t O
have O
car O
insurance O
or O
if O
you’re O
renting O
outside O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
where O
your O
personal O
policy O
won’t O
cover O
you O
. O

You’ll O
also O
find O
that O
many O
coverage O
options O
are O
slightly O
different O
from O
one O
another O

Some O
policies O
will O
only O
cover O
you O
to O
the O
maximum O
value O
of O
the O
car O
you’re O
renting O
, O
while O
others O
have O
higher O
limits O
. O

Many O
policies O
will O
also O
only O
cover O
you O
for O
a O
certain O
time O
period O
— O
31 O
days O
is O
very O
common O

So O
if O
you’re O
renting O
a O
car O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
you O
might O
find O
that O
your O
credit O
card O
coverage O
will O
not O
actually O
apply O
. O

Additionally O
, O
there O
are O
some O
car O
types O
that O
aren’t O
covered O
, O
such O
as O
luxury O
cars O
and O
pick-up O
trucks O
. O

You’ll O
also O
find O
that O
some O
countries O
are O
excluded O
, O
and O
while O
the O
list O
changes O
depending O
on O
the O
card O
issuer O
, O
Australia B-LOC
, O
New B-LOC
Zealand I-LOC
, O
Italy B-LOC
and O
Jamaica B-LOC
are O

our O

for O
the O

Whether O
it’s O

the O

a O
“costly O

But O
it’s O
a O
conflict O
climatologists O

out O
more O

how O
much O
water O
– O
or O
how O
little O

flowing O
down O
the O
South B-LOC

Ricketts B-PER

the O

land O

Without O

we O
will O
see O
the O
dramatic O
impact O

Ricketts B-PER

in O

pointing O
to O
Colorado’s B-LOC
ever-growing O

its O
estimate O

nearly O
$10 O
billion O
for O
282 O

along O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC

Should O
all O
the O
long-term O
goals O
be O
affected O

they O
would O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
water O
flows O
coming O
to O
the O
state O
of O
Nebraska B-LOC
by O
90 O
%. O

That O
rationale O
raised O
eyebrows O
in O
Colorado B-LOC

The O
fact O
is O
, O
many O
of O
those O
projects O
are O
not O
necessarily O
going O
to O
come O
to O
fruition O

Kevin B-PER

, O
Colorado’s B-LOC
state O
engineer O

director O
of O
the O
Colorado B-LOC
Division O
of O
Water O
Resources O
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
noting O
that O
the O
state O
curtails O

seniority O

ensure O
that O
Nebraska B-LOC

gets O
the O

In O

we O
