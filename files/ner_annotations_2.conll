With O
so O
many O

daunting O

But O
for O
most O
Americans B-LOC

it’s O
a O
necessary O
step O

establishing O
credit O

About O
92 O

Americans B-LOC
have O
little O

no O

according O

Equifax B-ORG

One O
way O
to O
build O
your O

is O
by O
opening O

using O
a O

So O
how O

to O

when O
shopping O
for O
a O
new O

: O
Is O
your O
credit O

high O
enough O
? O

Most O
cards O
have O
credit O
score O
requirements O
, O
among O
other O
criteria O
, O
so O
it’s O
important O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
your O
score O
is O
and O
whether O
it’s O
good O
enough O
for O
you O
to O
be O
approved O
. O

But O
what O
exactly O
constitutes O
a O
good O
credit O
score O
? O

Ted B-PER
Rossman I-PER
, O
senior O
industry O
analyst O
at O
Bankrate.com B-ORG
, O
explains O
that O
an O
excellent O
credit O
score O
is O
“ O
generally O
defined O
[ O
as O
 ] O
740 O
or O
higher O
on O
the O
FICO O
scale O
, O
which O
goes O
from O
300 O
to O
850 O
.” O

The O
FICO B-ORG
score O
represents O
how O
likely O
you O
are O
to O
pay O
back O
your O
credit O
card O
bill O
based O
off O
previous O
payments O

Although O
many O
credit O
cards O
have O
a O
FICO O
score O
cutoff O
of O
670 O
, O
it’s O
not O
a O
strict O
limit O
. O

“ O
The O
average O
FICO O
score O
is O
716 O
, O
so O
most O
people O
are O
in O
the O
right O
ballpark O
for O
most O
cards O
,” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O
“ O

If O
you O
want O
to O
raise O
your O
credit O
score O
, O
Rossman B-PER
said O
the O
key O
is O
paying O
your O
credit O
card O
bills O
on O
time O
, O
keeping O
your O
balance O
low O
and O
proving O
that O
you O
can O
successfully O
manage O
various O
types O
of O
credit O
over O
the O
long O
haul O
. O

And O
that O
can O
take O
time O

Much O
of O
this O
is O
a O
marathon O
, O
not O
a O
sprint O
, O
he O
noted O
. O

For O
those O
who O
are O
trying O
to O
improve O
a O
lower O
credit O
score O
or O
who O
are O
seeking O
to O
build O
credit O
, O
Rossman B-PER
suggests O
secured O
cards O
, O
which O
are O
backed O
by O
a O
security O
deposit O
and O
are O
often O
held O
in O
a O
linked O
bank O
account O
. O

This O
functions O
as O
collateral O
should O
you O
fail O
to O
pay O
your O
monthly O
bill O

These O
cards O
also O
have O
strict O
limits O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
cardholders O
to O
spend O
more O
money O
than O
they O
deposited O
upfront O

So O
if O
your O
security O
deposit O
was O
$500 O
, O
your O
spending O
limit O
will O
be O
$500 O
. O

What O
rewards O
does O
it O
offer O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
types O
of O
credit O
card O
rewards O
– O
cash O
back O
, O
points O
and O
miles O
. O

Cash O
back O
rewards O
pay O
cardholders O
a O
percentage O
of O
what O
they O
have O
spent O
on O
purchases O

The O
cash O
accumulated O
can O
typically O
be O
redeemed O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
check O
or O
direct O
deposit O
, O
applied O
to O
future O
balances O
as O
a O
statement O
credit O
, O
or O
sometimes O
used O
to O
make O
purchases O
. O

Points O
and O
miles O
rewards O
cards O
give O
cardholders O
the O
option O
to O
redeem O
their O
rewards O
for O
travel O
, O
and O
other O
products O
and O
services O
. O

Whichever O
form O
of O
rewards O
you O
choose O
, O
you’ll O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
enables O
you O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
your O
purchases O
. O

Start O
by O
considering O
how O
you O
spend O
your O
money O

While O
some O
cards O
offer O
more O
rewards O
for O
spending O
categories O
like O
travel O
and O
dining O
, O
others O
offer O
better O
benefits O
for O
grocery O
store O
purchases O
and O
gas O
. O

Others O
will O
rotate O
the O
categories O
that O
offer O
the O
highest O
rewards O
, O
or O
even O
let O
you O
choose O
. O

Many O
people O
prefer O
cash O
back O
rewards O
because O
they O
are O
easier O
to O
navigate O
and O
do O
not O
require O
tracking O
purchase O
categories O
, O
according O
to O
Rossman B-PER
. O

He O
suggests O
finding O
a O
card O
that O
gives O
2% O
cash O
back O
on O
every O
purchase O

If O
you’re O
willing O
to O
dabble O
with O
different O
cards O
in O
order O
to O
chase O
more O
rewards O
, O
Rossman B-PER
recommends O
having O
a O
cash O
back O
card O
for O
general O
purchases O
, O
and O
then O
layering O
in O
other O
cards O
for O
more O
specific O
categories O
. O

Use O
something O
like O
[ O
a O
general O
cash O
back O
card O
] O
as O
a O
floor O
, O
guaranteeing O
you’ll O
never O
get O
less O
than O
2% O
cash O
back O
on O
a O
given O
purchase O
, O
and O
lean O
into O
categories O
in O
which O
you O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
, O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O

Be O
mindful O
of O
fees O
While O
many O
banks O
won’t O
charge O
you O
anything O
just O
to O
have O
a O
credit O
card O
, O
some O
rewards O
cards O
will O
charge O
annual O
fees O
, O
typically O
ranging O
from O
$95 O
per O
year O
to O
as O
much O
as O
$695 O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
the O
better O
the O
rewards O
, O
the O
more O
annual O
fees O
, O
” O
said O
David B-PER
Lord I-PER
, O
general O
manager O
at O
Credit.com B-ORG
. O

While O
some O
of O
those O
fees O
might O
seem O
high O
, O
they O
can O
be O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
know O
you O
will O
use O
all O
the O
benefits O
the O
card O
offers O
. O

“These O
are O
often O
travel O
cards O
with O
premium O
perks” O
said O
Rossman. B-PER

The O
annual O
fee O
might O
be O
well O
worth O
it O
if O
you’re O
going O
to O
make O
good O
use O
of O
the O
airport O
lounge O
, O
the O
free O
checked O
bags O
or O
other O
perks O
, O
but O
not O
if O
you O
rarely O
travel O
. O

Another O
common O
fee O
is O
the O
foreign O
transaction O
fee O
– O
which O
typically O
adds O
3% O
to O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
products O
and O
services O
bought O
in O
other O
countries O

If O
you O
travel O
abroad O
often O
, O
you’ll O
want O
to O
avoid O
cards O
that O
charge O
such O
fees O
. O

Most O
cards O
will O
also O
charge O
late O
payment O
fees O
. O

Up O
to O
$30 O
for O
the O
first O
offense O
and O
up O
to O
$41 O
for O
subsequent O
offenses O
within O
six O
billing O
cycles,” O
said O
Rossman. B-PER

Another O
important O
fee O
to O
consider O
is O
a O
cash O
advance O
fee O
. O

But O
Rossman B-PER
advises O
against O
using O
a O
credit O
card O
to O
get O
cash O
. O

There’s O
a O
separate O
fee, O
plus O
interest O
starts O
accruing O
immediately O
at O
a O
higher O
rate O
than O
normal O
purchases. O

How O
high O
are O
the O
interest O
rates O
. O

While O
credit O
card O
interest O
rates O
can O
go O
as O
high O
as O
36% O
, O
the O
average O
credit O
card O
charges O
about O
17% O
, O
according O
to O
Bankrate B-ORG
. O

These O
fees O
can O
really O
add O
up O
if O
you O
don’t O
pay O
off O
your O
balance O
every O
month O
. O

For O
those O
who O
carry O
a O
balance O
, O
the O
accrued O
interest O
can O
easily O
cancel O
out O
any O
rewards O
the O
card O
offers O
. O

It O
doesn’t O
make O
sense O
to O
pursue O
1% O
, O
2% O
or O
even O
5% O
in O
cash O
back O
( O
or O
an O
equivalent O
amount O
of O
airline O
miles O
or O
hotel O
points O
) O
if O
you’re O
paying O
a O
high O
interest O
rate O
” O
said O
Rossman B-PER

But O
figuring O
out O
the O
interest O
rate O
might O
not O
be O
as O
simple O
as O
it O
sounds O

Cards O
often O
charge O
different O
rates O
on O
purchases O
versus O
balance O
transfers O
or O
cash O
advances O

And O
most O
credit O
card O
issuers O
offer O
variable O
rates O
, O
which O
means O
they O
can O
change O
over O
time O
. O

Many O
cards O
will O
also O
offer O
an O
introductory O
rate O
– O
some O
as O
low O
as O
0% O
– O
for O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
time O

But O
cardholders O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
that O
the O
rate O
can O
skyrocket O
when O
the O
period O
ends O

As O
long O
as O
you’re O
diligent O
about O
paying O
the O
card O
off O
before O
the O
introductory O
period O
expires O
, O
a O
0% O
rate O
on O
purchases O
can O
prove O
to O
be O
a O
big O
financial O
benefit O
. O

That’s O
especially O
true O
for O
people O
looking O
to O
make O
a O
few O
big O
purchases O
– O
like O
a O
vacation O
or O
wedding O
– O
early O
in O
the O
term O
but O
need O
a O
little O
more O
time O
to O
pay O
it O
off O

You O
can O
divide O
what O
you O
owe O
by O
the O
number O
of O
months O
remaining O
and O
try O
to O
stick O
to O
it O
, O
said O
Rossman B-PER
. O

I O
think O
this O
makes O
more O
sense O
than O
constantly O
making O
a O
series O
of O
purchases O
with O
the O
0% O
card O

Overall O
, O
when O
picking O
that O
new O
plastic O
, O
there O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
as O
one-size-fits-all O
. O

Instead, O
it’s O
about O
doing O
the O
research O
and O
finding O
what O
works O
best O
for O
you. O

were O
arrested O
for O
criminal O

In O
September O

protests O
began O
to O
take O

nightly O
in O
Louisville B-LOC
after O

was O
known O
nationally O
and O
beyond O

just O
as O
Floyd B-PER

and O
her O
death O
was O
a O
central O
part O
of O
the O
protests O
that O
rocked O
the O
country O
throughout O
much O
of O
2020 O

Celebrities O
took O
up O
the O

, O
who O
put O
Taylor O

The O
aftermath O
Those O
protests O
sparked O
a O
movement O
demanding O
a O
change O
in O

and O
even O
seeking O
to O
defund O
police O
departments O

Police O
and O
some O
witnesses O
gave O
conflicting O
reports O
on O
whether O
the O
officers O
announced O
themselves O
before O
battering O
down O
Taylor’s B-PER
door O

but O
her O
death O
drew O
attention O

The O
officer O
who O
rammed O
the O

at O
Taylor’s B-PER
apartment O
testified O
at O
Hankison’s B-PER
state O
trial O
that O
police O
announced O
themselves O
four O
or O
five O
times O

In O
Louisville B-LOC
, O
the O
controversy O
led O
to O
the O
passing O
of O
“Breonna’s B-ORG

in O
June O
2020 O
, O
which O
bans O
such O

. O

Almost O
a O
year O
later O
, O
in O
April O
2021 O
, O
the O
Kentucky B-LOC
state O
legislature O
passed O
a O
bill O
setting O
restrictions O
on O
no-knock O

did O
not O
outlaw O
them O
outright O
. O

In O
June O

In O
September O
2020 O
, O
the O
city O

Louisville B-LOC
agreed O
to O
pay O
a O
historic O
$12 O

It O
included O
an O
agreement O
for O
the O

The O
settlement O
stipulated O
the O
city O
would O
establish O
a O

an O

the O
areas O

Literally O

I’ve O
repeatedly O
had O
that O
dream O
, O
going O
back O
decades O
. O

I O
have O
traveled O
to O
space O
, O
back O
in O
time O
and O
turned O
into O
a O
superhero O
. O

I’ve O
been O
close O
friends O
with O
many O
celebrities O
. O

I’ve O
created O
new O
memories O
with O
friends O
and O
family O
, O
some O
deceased O
. O

I O
have O
committed O
terrible O
crimes O

And O
I’ve O
saved O
the O
day O
, O
repeatedly O

Our O
sleeping O
mind O
is O
a O
private O
theater O
where O
you O
are O
the O
director O
and O
usually O
the O
star O
and O
there O
is O
no O
limit O
to O
the O
production O
budget O

Yes O
, O
some O
of O
them O
are O
boring O
( O
the O
majority O
of O
mine O
are O
about O
work O
) O
, O
but O
many O
are O
entertaining O
, O
incisive O
and O
occasionally O
problem-solving O
. O

That’s O
why O
you O
should O
consider O
turning O
a O
blank O
notebook O
into O
your O
first O
dream O
journal O

There O
is O
little O
scientific O
research O
into O
the O
benefits O
of O
dream O
journaling O
, O
but O
those O
who O
make O
it O
a O
practice O
find O
it O
useful O

insightful O

interesting O

very O

The O
first O
potential O
benefit O
of O
dream O
journaling O
is O
that O
it O
may O
lead O
to O
a O
creative O
breakthrough O

Your O
subconscious O
dreaming O
mind O
is O
by O
nature O
, O
more O
inventive O
. O

Your O
dreams O
jump O
around O
in O
time O
, O
make O
leaps O
in O
logic O
, O
accept O
contradictions O
and O
sometimes O
make O
no O
sense O
at O
all O
to O
our O
more O
conventional O
conscious O
mind O
. O

Dreaming O
permits O
each O
and O
every O
one O
of O
us O
to O
be O
quietly O
and O
safely O
insane O
every O
night O
of O

Inception O
In O
centuries O
past O
, O
people O
believed O
dreams O
were O
messages O
from O
the O
dead O
that O
contained O
clues O
for O
what O
the O
living O
should O
do O

Egyptian O
pharaohs O
believed O
gods O
sent O
messages O
to O
us O
in O
our O
dreams O
; O
they O
called O
them O
omina O
, O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
word O
omen O
. O

And O
the O
major O
faiths O
today O
contain O
stories O
in O
their O
sacred O
texts O
in O
which O
dreams O
are O
important O
riddles O
whose O
meaning O
must O
be O
worked O
out O

A O
more O
current O
theory O
about O
why O
we O
dream O
is O
that O
it O
helps O
sort O
, O
organize O
and O
process O
all O
the O
stimuli O
from O
our O
waking O
life O
, O
like O
clearing O
out O
cobwebs O
. O

But O
sometimes O
there’s O
silk O
to O
be O
made O
of O
the O
webs O
, O
when O
the O
answer O
to O
a O
problem O
you O
can’t O
solve O
in O
your O
waking O
life O
gets O
worked O
out O
in O
your O
more O
creative O
dreaming O
one O

Dream O
solutions O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
operating O
“ O
without O

Sigmund B-PER
Freud I-PER
, O
who O
wrote O
the O
first O

thought O
they O
primarily O
reveal O
secrets O

But O
his O
mentee-turned-rival O

us O
find O

answers O

Another O
theory O
is O
that O

act O

a O
way O

That O
seems O
a O
likely O
explanation O
of O

in O

where O
intense O
negative O
emotions O

, O
Peterkin B-PER
explained O

They O
are O
useful O
, O
according O
to O

can O
help O
train O

And O
by O

what O

, O
you O
travel O
along O

After O

noticing O

One O
more O

can O
be O
“an O
incredible O
virtual O
reality O
model O
of O
the O
world,” O
Peterkin B-PER
wrote, O
“updated O
with O
cool O
new O
content O
several O
times O
each O
night.” O

In O
some O
of O
my O
wildest O
dreams O
, O
I O
married O
Nicole B-PER
Kidman I-PER
, O
joined O
Laird B-PER
Hamilton I-PER
’s O
surfing O
crew O
, O
beat O
LL O
Cool B-PER
J I-PER
in O
a O
rap O
battle O
and O
drove O
Speed B-PER
Racer I-PER
’s O
car O
, O
the O
Mach O
5 O
. O

In O
still O
others O
, O
Sarah B-PER
Silverman I-PER
was O
my O
therapist O
, O
Ally B-PER
Sheedy I-PER
and O
I O
had O
a O
fling O
while O
we O
made O
an O
’80s O
movie O
together O
, O
and O
I O
played O
Han B-PER
Solo I-PER
in O
a O
version O
of O
“Hamlet,” O
using O
a O
script O
made O
out O
of O
graham O
crackers O
. O

I O
went O
to O
high O
school O
in O
the O
1800s O
, O
with O
Hulk B-PER
Hogan I-PER
, O
at O
which O
time O
I O
attended O
Gen. O
Robert B-PER
E. I-PER
Lee’s I-PER
funeral O
. O

And O
I O
was O
the O
Batman O

I O
can O
remember O
these O
dreams O
and O
hundreds O
more O
because O
I O
have O
been O
writing O
them O
down O
since O
high O
school O

It’s O
the O
simple O
act O
of O
recording O
dreams O
that O
keeps O
them O
from O
evaporating O
in O
the O
sunlight O
of O
day O

Total O
recall O
Of O
the O
many O
dream-themed O
movies O
, O
my O
two O
favorites O
are O
Christopher B-PER
Nolan’s I-PER
“Inception” O
and O
the O
lesser-known O
1991 O
Wim B-PER
Wenders’ I-PER
film O
, O
“Until O
the O
End O
of O
the O
World,” O
with O
William B-PER
Hurt I-PER
, O
Sam B-PER
Neill I-PER
and O
Max B-PER
von I-PER
Sydow I-PER
. O

As O
a O
subplot O
in O
“Until,” O
the O
main O
characters O
find O
a O
way O
to O
video-record O
their O
dreams O
and O
subsequently O
become O
narcissistically O
addicted O
to O
watching O
them O
( O
to O
the O
point O
of O
madness O
) O

You’re O
now O
looking O
at O
the O
human O
soul O
, O
singing O
to O
itself O
. O

To O
its O
own O
God O
! O

von O
Sydow B-PER
’s O
character O
says O

As O
fun O
as O
that O
sounds O
, O
present-day O
technology O
has O
not O
advanced O
us O
to O
the O
point O
of O
DVRing O
our O
dreams O
( O
yet O
) O

The O
closest O
thing O
available O
is O
writing O
them O
down O
. O

There’s O
little O
you O
need O
to O
get O
started O

Find O
a O
dream O
journal O
app O
or O
designate O
a O
notebook O
to O
keep O
next O
to O
your O
bed O

And O
the O
next O
time O
you O
recall O
a O
dream O
, O
even O
a O
hazy O
, O
half-remembered O
one O
, O
write O
it O
down O
. O

Even O
if O
it’s O
boring O
and O
doesn’t O
seem O
worth O
remembering O
, O
write O
it O
down O
. O

The O
more O
you O
get O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
recording O
them O
, O
the O
better O
your O
recall O
will O
get O
. O

I O
also O
leave O
a O
scrap O
of O
paper O
out O
in O
case O
I O
make O
some O
scribbled O
notes O
of O
key O
words O
and O
elements O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O

Even O
a O
single O
detail O
can O
bring O
back O
the O
memory O
of O
an O
entire O
dream O

Telling O
someone O
your O
dream O
soon O
after O
you O
wake O
up O
can O
also O
help O
hold O
on O
to O
it O
until O
you O
write O
it O
down O

My O
dream O
journals O
have O
evolved O
over O
the O
years O
to O
include O
headlines O
for O
them O
, O
tracking O
themes O
, O
people O
and O
locations O
, O
as O
well O
as O
noting O
how O
many O
were O
“good” O
“bad” O
or O
“neutral/in O
between.” O

I O
do O
that O
to O
look O
for O
trends O
, O
but O
don’t O
make O
the O
bar O
too O
high O
for O
yourself O
, O
especially O
when O
you’re O
starting O
. O

I O
also O
, O
on O
occasion O
, O
will O
write O
a O
note O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dream O
if O
I O
feel O
I O
have O
some O
insight O
into O
its O
meaning O
. O

I O
may O
instantly O
recognize O
that O
a O
dream O
about O
being O
lost O
in O
a O
city B-LOC
is O
really O
about O
losing O
a O
work O
file O
, O
for O
example O
. O

Dream O
dictionaries O
compile O
mythology O
, O
psychology O
and O
cultural O
symbolism O
and O
can O
be O
interesting O
to O
look O
up O
reoccurring O
themes O
in O
, O
even O
if O
there O
is O
little O
that O
is O
scientific O
about O
them O
, O
except O
in O
a O
Jungian B-PER
collective O
, O
unconscious O
way O
. O

Just O
remember O
always O
to O
interpret O
a O
dream O
through O
your O
personal O
experience O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
dream O
dictionary O
may O
suggest O
a O
dog O
in O
a O
dream O
means O
loyalty O
. O

But O
if O
you’re O
scared O
of O
dogs O
, O
it O
more O
likely O
represents O
something O
else O
you’re O
afraid O
of O
. O

Or O
if O
your O
mom O
owns O
five O
dogs O
, O
your O
dream O
dog O
may O
be O
standing O
in O
for O
her O
. O

As O
the O
great O
myth O
expert O
Joseph B-PER
Campbell I-PER
put O
it O
, O
“Myths O
are O
public O
dreams O
, O
dreams O
are O
private O

Kansas B-LOC
voters O
handed O
abortion-rights O
advocates O
a O
massive O
victory O
Tuesday O
, O
surging O
to O
the O
polls O
to O
defeat O
a O
measure O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
the O
GOP-led O
legislature O
to O

The O
vote O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
tests O
of O
the O
potency O
of O
abortion O
rights O
at O
the O
ballot O
box O
since O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court’s I-ORG
decision O

reverse O
Roe B-PER
v. O
Wade I-PER
and O
end O
the O
federal O
protection O

Catch O
up O
on O
the O
night’s O
news O
here O
Meanwhile O
, O
in O
Michigan B-LOC
, O
one O
of O
the O
10 O
House O
Republicans O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
was O
ousted O
, O
while O
the O
matchup O
was O
set O
for O
what O
will O
be O
one O
of O
the O
key O
gubernatorial O
races O
this O
fall O

And O
in O
Missouri B-LOC
, O
the O
political O
comeback O
of O
a O
former O
governor O
was O
shut O
down O
. O

In O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
local O
elections O
officials O
were O
still O
counting O
votes O
, O
but O
some O
of O
the O
slate O
of O
statewide O
candidates O
who O
were O
endorsed O
by O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
and O

Republican O
primaries O
, O
CNN B-ORG
projects O

Here O
are O
six O
takeaways O
from O
Tuesday O
night’s O
primaries O
: O
Kansas B-LOC
maintains O
constitutional O
right O
to O
abortion O
Kansas B-LOC
voters O
sent O
a O
dramatic O
message O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
opting O
to O
maintain O
the O
right O
to O
an O
abortion O
in O
their O
state’s O
constitution O
just O
weeks O
after O
the O
US B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
decided O
to O
overturn O
Roe B-PER
v. O
Wade I-PER
. O

Polls O
have O
long O
shown O
that O
voters O
overwhelmingly O
support O
protecting O
abortions O
rights O

But O
the O
win O
for O
the O
“no” O
vote O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
is O
proof O
of O
that O
and O
signals O
that O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
decision O
has O
further O
angered O
voters O
and O
possibly O
shifted O
the O
politics O
of O
the O
issue O
ahead O
of O
the O
November B-LOC
elections O

The O
“no” O
leaves O
the O
state O
constitution O
unchanged O

While O
lawmakers O
in O
the O
state O
can O
still O
try O
to O
pass O
restrictive O
abortion O
laws O
, O
courts O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
have O
recognized O
a O
right O
to O
abortion O
under O
the O
state O
constitution O
. O

The O
biggest O
warning O
to O
Republicans B-ORG
, O
many O
of O
whom O
have O
trumpeted O
the O
overturning O
of O
Roe O
and O
backed O
pushes O
to O
pass O
stricter O
abortions O
laws O
, O
is O
perhaps O
the O
turnout O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
. O

With O
78% O
of O
the O
vote O
in O
on O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
nearly O
700,000 O
people O
have O
cast O
ballots O
in O
the O
primary O
, O
a O
figure O
that O
already O
dwarfs O
the O
turnout O
in O
the O
2020 O
presidential O
primary O
election O
. O

This O
is O
further O
proof O
of O
what O
poll O
after O
poll O
has O
told O
us O
: O
Americans O
support O
abortion O
rights O
, O
said O
Christina B-PER

that O

They O
believe O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
make O
our O
own O
health O

they O
will O
vote O
accordingly O

it’s O
that O
Covid-19 O
is O
one O
strange O
disease O
. O

The O
latest O
case O
in O
point: O
the O
coronavirus O
rebound. O

The O
condition O
grabbed O
international O
attention O
last O
week O
when O
US O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
tested O
positive O
for O
the O
virus O
six O
days O
after O
testing O
negative O
following O
his O
first O
bout O
of O
the O
illness O

The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
said O
Biden B-PER
, O
who O
is O
back O
in O
isolation O
, O
was O
experiencing O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
“loose O
cough” O
but O
did O
not O
have O
a O
fever O
and O
his O
lungs O
were O
“clear.” O

The O
President O
tested O
positive O
again O
after O
being O
treated O
with O
the O
antiviral O
Paxlovid O
. O

White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
had O
previously O
suggested O
a O
rebound O
case O
of O
Covid O
was O
unlikely O
, O
based O
on O
reports O
of O
cases O
around O
the O
country O
, O
but O
Biden’s B-PER
doctors O
continued O
to O
monitor O
his O
health O
and O
test O
him O
. O

Dr. O
Ashish B-PER
Jha I-PER
, O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
Covid O
response O
coordinator O
, O
said O
clinical O
data O
shows O
the O
rate O
of O
rebound O
infections O
is O
low O
and O
noted O
that O
even O
those O
who O
suffer O
them O
are O
still O
generally O
protected O
from O
serious O
illness O
. O

Biden B-PER
is O
not O
the O
only O
high-profile O
patient O
to O
develop O
the O
condition O

National B-ORG
Institute I-ORG

Allergy I-ORG

Infectious I-ORG
Diseases I-ORG
Director O
Dr. O
Anthony B-PER
Fauci I-PER
also O
experienced O
rebound O
Covid-19 O

Unlike O
Biden’s B-PER
, O
his O
symptoms O
got O
worse O
when O
they O
returned O
after O
treatment O
with O
Paxlovid O
, O
and O
his O
doctors O
prescribed O
another O
course O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

Experts O
have O
been O
calling O
for O
more O
systematic O
research O
into O
the O
instances O
of O
rebound O
to O
understand O
who O
is O
most O
at O
risk O
and O
whether O
the O
standard O
five-day O
course O
of O
Paxlovid O
should O
be O
lengthened O
to O
prevent O
it O

Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
people O
can O
pass O
the O
infection O
to O
others O
during O
a O
rebound O
, O
which O
is O
another O
reason O
to O
try O
to O
understand O
it O
better O

The O

( O

issued O
a O
health O
alert O
to O
doctors O
in O
May O
about O
the O
potential O
for O
Covid-19 O
rebound O
, O
saying O
symptoms O
sometimes O
come O
back O

and O
that O
may O
just O
be O
how O
the O
infection O
plays O
out O
in O
some O
people O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
they’re O
vaccinated O
or O
treated O
with O
medications O
like O
Paxlovid O
. O

The O
CDC B-ORG
said O
most O
cases O
of O
rebound O
involve O
mild O
disease O
and O
that O
Paxlovid B-ORG
“continues O
to O
be O
recommended O
for O
early-stage O
treatment O
of O
mild O
to O
moderate O
COVID-19 O
among O
persons O
at O
high O

progression O

severe O
disease O
.” O

Pfizer B-ORG
, O
the O
company O
that O
makes O
Paxlovid O
, O
has O
said O
its O
studies O
showed O
rebounds O
were O
rare O
, O
and O
that O
they O
happened O
in O
both O
people O
who O
took O
the O
drug O
and O
those O
who O
took O
a O
placebo O
pill O
. O

Because O
investigators O
noted O
the O
phenomenon O
in O
both O
groups O

the O

doesn’t O
believe O
it O
is O
tied O

YOU O

WE O
ANSWERED O

Q: O
How O
does O
Paxlovid O
work? O

A: O
Considered O
a O
game-changer O
when O
it O
was O
authorized O
in O
December O
because O
of O
its O
strong O
performance O
in O
lowering O
the O
risk O
of O
severe O
Covid-19 O
, O
Paxlovid O
– O
in O
combination O
with O
vaccines O
and O
boosters O
– O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
best O
ways O
to O
protect O
people O
at O
high O
risk O
for O
severe O
illness O
. O

The O
drug O
suppresses O
the O
coronavirus O
, O
blocking O
an O
enzyme O
that O
helps O
it O
reproduce O
inside O
the O
body O
. O

As O
with O
all O
antivirals O
, O
the O
treatment O
is O
thought O
to O
work O
best O
if O
started O
within O
five O
days O
of O
the O
first O
symptoms O
appearing O
. O

Clinical O
trials O
of O
Paxlovid B-ORG
showed O
that O
it O
reduced O
the O
risk O
of O
hospitalization O
and O
death O
by O
88% O
when O

as O
well O
as O
a O
$4,000 O

It O
also O
gets O
rid O

automakers O
off O

after O
they’ve O
sold O
200,000 O

it O

the O

think O
I’m O
more O

more O
confident O
[ O

than O
I O
was O
even O
a O
week O

because O
of O
what O
that O

which O
was O
a O

pretty O
precise O
action O

” O
a O

that O

other O

that O
we O

we’re O

” O
the O

But O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
pretty O
powerful O
demonstration O
of O
what O
that O
capability O
can O
provide O
. O

The O
US B-LOC
now O
largely O
relies O

But O
drone O
flights O
from O
the O

are O
logistically O
complicated O
and O
have O
limited O
loiter O
time O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
thanks O
to O
the O
long O
flight O
, O
making O
them O
expensive O

And O
without O
a O

on O

, O

expect O

may O

I O
think O
we O
don’t O
know O
what O

Difficult O
questions O
For O
now O
, O
there O
is O
broad O
consensus O
inside O
the O
intelligence O
community O
that O
the O
immediate O
threat O
that O
al B-ORG

be O
able O
to O
use O
Afghanistan B-LOC
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
to O
plan O
attacks O
on O
the O
US B-LOC

or O
US B-LOC
interests O
remains O
low O
. O

But O
difficult O
questions O
remain O
about O
whether O
that O
risk O
will O
grow O
over O
time O

Much O
depends O
on O
current O
unknowns O
– O
in O
particular O
, O
how O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
responds O
to O
the O
killing O
of O

. O

Will O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
actually O
let O
AQ O
use O
Afghanistan B-LOC
? O

said O
one O
source O
familiar O
with O
the O

There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
factors O
that O
play O
into O
this O
debate O
, O
this O
person O

“ O

And O
all O
complicated O

The O

in O
its O
annual O

released O
this O

the O
threat O
from O
al B-ORG

as O
a O
greater O
risk O
to O

Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
officials O
believe O
, O
is O
still O
gauging O
its O
ability O
to O
operate O
under O
Taliban B-ORG
rule O
and O
will O
likely O
remain O
focused O
on O
maintaining O
its O
safe O
haven O
rather O
than O
planning O
external O
operations O
– O
at O
least O
for O
now O
. O

And O
although O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
leaders O
have O
enjoyed O
“increased O
freedom O
of O
action” O
under O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
, O
according O
to O
a O
recent O
UN B-ORG
report O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O
major O
influx O
of O
new O
fighters O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
since O
the O
US B-ORG
withdrawal O
— O
a O
reflection O
of O
how O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
has O
evolved O
away O
from O
centrally-planned O
attacks O
, O
according O
to O
some O
analysts O
. O

But O
as O
for O
what O
happens O
next O
, O
one O
US B-ORG
source O
described O
the O
analysis O
across O
intelligence O
agencies O
as O
“ O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O
” O

What O
we O
don’t O
think O
we O
have O
occurring O
is O
some O
sort O
of O
regrowth O
[ O
or O
regeneration O
of O
an O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
operational O
presence O
— O
even O
with O
less O
famous O
names O
[ O
than O
Zawahiri B-PER
],” O
the O
senior O
administration O
official O
said O

There O
is O
one O
school O
of O
thought O
that O
while O
some O
elements O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
may O
feel O
honor-bound O
to O
uphold O
its O
oath O
to O
shield O
old O
guard O
members O
of O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
like O
Zawahiri B-PER
, O
it O
has O
no O
obligation O
or O
incentive O
to O
make O
welcome O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
fighters O
. O

And O
according O
to O
intelligence O
officials O
, O
there O
are O
vanishingly O
few O
members O
of O
the O
original O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
leadership O
who O
remain O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
none O
of O
whom O
are O
likely O
to O
replace O
Zawahiri B-PER

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
recent O
strike O
, O
some O
analysts O
argue O
, O
may O
dissuade O
terrorist O
leaders O
from O
traveling O
to O
the O
country O
from O
elsewhere O
. O

They O
argue O
that O
the O
far O
greater O
risk O
is O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
affiliates O
in O
Africa B-LOC
and O
elsewhere O
that O
are O
only O
loosely O
connected O
to O
core O
leaders O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

There’s O
some O
people O
who O
are O
very O
worried O
,” O
said O
Sanner B-PER
, O
who O
is O
now O
a O
contributor O
at O
CNN B-ORG
. O

I O
personally O
think O
that O
AQ O
core O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
doesn’t O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
operational O
planning O
. O

Others O
assess O
that O
it’s O
more O
likely O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
– O
consumed O
with O
trying O
to O
legitimize O
its O
government O
amid O
a O
financial O
implosion O
and O
an O
ongoing O
conflict O
with O
ISIS-K B-ORG
– O
simply O
may O
not O
have O
the O
bandwidth O
to O
prevent O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
being O
used O
by O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
or O
its O
affiliates O
to O
plan O
attacks O
on O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

There O
are O
also O
concerns O
that O
the O
remnants O
of O
al O

may O
simply O
be O
absorbed O
into O
the O
Taliban B-ORG

How O
the O

responds O
to O
the O
death O

an O

one O
that O

are O
watching O

multiple O

According O
to O
one O

, O
it’s O
not O
clear O
to O
US B-ORG
intelligence I-ORG
how O
many O
people O
in O
the O

knew O
that O
Zawahiri B-PER

holed O
up O
in O

The O
Taliban B-ORG
has O
publicly O

that O

” O
a O
statement O
by O

White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
said O
on O
Monday O
that O
senior O

figures O
were O
aware O
of O
Zawahiri’s B-PER
presence O
in O

even O
took O
steps O
to O
conceal O
his O

after O
Saturday’s O
successful O

As O

that O

? O

the O

The O
senior O

said O
Friday O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
“ O
is O
scrambling O
a O
bit O
to O
figure O
out O
who O
knew O
what O

who O

moreover O
, O
to O
get O
their O
story O
straight O
on O
what O
happened O
.” O

Some O
US B-LOC
military O
officials O
are O
hopeful O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
that O
the O
strike O
may O
help O
push O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
towards O
some O
sort O
of O
limited O
cooperation O
with O
the O
US B-LOC
to O
target O
ISIS-K B-ORG
, O
a O
common O
enemy O
and O
separate O
terrorist O
group O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
that O
the O
US B-LOC
military O
is O
far O
more O
concerned O
about O
than O
al O

, O
according O
to O
two O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
dynamic O
. O

I O
think O
this O
was O
a O
symbolic O
strike O
that O
removed O
an O
inspirational O
leader O
,” O
Sanner B-PER
said O
. O

It O
completes O
the O
task O
of O
removing O
the O
two O
people O
who O
were O
at O
the O
center O
of O
9/11 O

But O
it O
is O
the O
end O
of O
an O
era O
– O
it O
is O
not O
about O
a O
current O
threat O
. O

Residents O

built O
their O

But O
as O
an O
intense O
and O
widespread O
drought O
digs O
into O
the O
High B-LOC

, O
flows O
have O
decreased O
. O

Unwilling O
to O
leave O
things O
to O
chance O
, O
Nebraska B-LOC
has O
taken O
action O
by O
invoking O
the O
fine O
print O
of O
a O
century-old O
water O
compact O
between O
the O
two O
states O
— O
and O
sparking O
new O
tension O
in O
the O
process O
. O

Nebraska B-LOC
Gov. O
Pete B-PER
Ricketts I-PER
in O
April O
signed O
legislation O
that O
, O
within O
the O
terms O
of O
the O

, O
would O
allow O
Nebraska B-LOC
to O
build O
a O
canal O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
to O
siphon O
water O
off O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC

In O
response O
, O
Colorado B-LOC
Gov. O
Jared B-PER
Polis I-PER
described O
the O
plan O
as O
a O
“costly O
and O
misguided O
political O
stunt. O
” O

But O
it’s O
a O
conflict O
climatologists O
say O
could O
play O
out O
more O
often O
as O
drought O
expands O
in O
the O
West B-LOC

Central B-LOC

draining O

exacerbating O

We O
go O
through O

20 O

nothing O

how O
much O
water O
– O
or O
how O
little O
– O
is O
flowing O
down O
the O
South B-LOC

Ricketts B-PER
to O
announce O
the O
$500 O

plan O
to O
build O
a O
canal O
on O

land O
to O
funnel O
water O
into O

reservoir O
system O
during O

Without O
this O

our O
ability O

enforce O
our O
rights O
, O
we O
will O
see O
the O
dramatic O
impact O
upon O
our O
state O
, O
Ricketts B-PER
said O
in O
an O
April O
press O
conference O

pointing O
to O
Colorado’s B-LOC
ever-growing O
population O

its O
estimate O
of O
nearly O
$10 O
billion O
for O
282 O

along O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC

Should O
all O
the O
long-term O
goals O
be O
affected O

they O
would O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
water O
flows O
coming O

the O
state O
of O
Nebraska B-LOC
by O
90 O
%. O

That O
rationale O
raised O
eyebrows O
in O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
many O
of O
those O
projects O
are O
not O

Rein B-PER
said O
, O
the O
amount O

Well O
, O
obviously O
, O
nobody O
wants O
to O
lose O
any O
of O
their O
property O
, O
” O
Goddard B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
while O
walking O
along O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
ditch O
, O
with O
the O
interstate O
highway O
and O
Nebraska B-LOC
visible O
in O
the O
distance O
. O

The O
ground O
on O
his O
ranch O
is O
dry O
and O
brittle O
. O

There’s O
usually O
water O
standing O
in O
some O
of O
these O
lagoons O
and O
they’re O
completely O
dry O
right O
now O
. O

He’s O
also O
concerned O
about O
the O
impacts O
of O
the O
canal O
on O
the O
overall O
health O
of O
the O
river O

I O
hope O
it O
doesn’t O
knock O
down O
the O
flow O
during O
the O
wintertime O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hunters O
that O
come O
to O
this O
area O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
wildlife O
— O
whether O
geese O
, O
turkey O
, O
deer O
and O
ducks O
— O
that O
come O
through O
on O
a O
migration O
and O
so O
I’m O
worried O
that O
it O
will O
dry O
up O
the O
river O
at O
the O
wrong O
time O
, O
” O
Goddard B-PER
said O
. O

Not O
only O
would O
that O
hurt O
Julesburg’s B-LOC
tourism O
and O
economy O
, O
but O
it O
would O
also O
impact O
its O
neighbors’ O
businesses O
as O
well O
. O

Goddard B-PER
explained O
that O
the O
border O
is O
porous O
, O
with O
many O
— O
like O
him O
— O
having O
operations O
in O
both O
states O
. O

I O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
my O
[agriculture] O
producers O
and O
the O
folks O
that O
bank O
on O
our O
[agriculture] O
lending O
side O
are O
taken O
care O
of O
well O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
line O
Goddard B-PER
said O

Just O
on O
the O
other O
side O
in O
Nebraska B-LOC
, O
farmer O
Darrel B-PER
Armstrong I-PER
sees O
the O
issue O
as O
less O
about O
Nebraska B-LOC
versus O
Colorado B-LOC
and O
more O
a O
battle O
of O
“ O
agriculture O
against O
urban O
.” O

We O
feel O
that O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
agreements O
that O
have O
been O
made O
that O
[rural O
areas O
are] O
coming O
up O
short,” O
Armstrong B-PER
said O
to O
CNN B-ORG

The O
people O
who O
are O
upholding O
the O
agreements O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
making O
the O
agreements O
. O

According O
to O
Cech B-PER
, O
the O
population O
expansion O
in O
the O
High B-LOC
Plains I-LOC
was O
enabled O
by O
the O
agriculture O
industry O
. O

If O
you O
don’t O
have O
irrigation O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
– O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
– O
all O
you’re O
going O
to O
grow O
is O
probably O
prickly O
pear O
cactus O
and O
sagebrush O
,” O
Cech B-PER
said O
. O

Water O
is O
key O
to O
that O
economic O
growth O
, O
not O
only O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
or O
Western B-LOC
Nebraska I-LOC
, O
but O
in O
California B-LOC
and O
the O
West B-LOC
in O
general O
. O

As O
the O
drought O
lingers O
, O
which O
Armstrong B-PER
called O
, O
“ O
very O
devastating O
, O
” O
the O
tougher O
the O
conditions O
for O
his O
business O
. O

We O
are O
looking O
at O
potentially O
zero O
production O
on O
our O
dry O
land O
crops O
without O
water O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

He O
agrees O
with O
Goddard B-PER
that O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
needs O
to O
be O
protected O

“ O
The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
basically O
is O
the O
lifeblood O
to O
our O
surface O
aquifer O
and O
so O
we O
need O
to O
somehow O
keep O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
running O
,” O
Armstrong B-PER
said O
.” O

We’re O
seeing O
less O
and O
less O
come O
down O
the O
river O
from O
what O
we O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Lawsuits O
could O
delay O
Nebraska B-LOC
from O
moving O
forward O
with O
its O
canal O

But O
for O
now O
, O
on O
these O
farms O
and O
ranches O
, O
there O
are O
more O
questions O
than O
answers O
. O

What O
can O
they O
do O
for O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it’s O
not O
disrupting O
my O
production O
, O
but O
also O
my O
other O
producers O
in O
this O
area O
. O

rancher O

The O
Federal B-ORG

war O
on O

eventually O
kill O
the O
economic O
recovery O
from O
Covid-19 O
, O
former O
Fed O
official O
Bill B-PER
Dudley I-PER
warns O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
began O
its O
quest O
to O
tame O
inflation O
late O
, O
leaving O
the O
central O
bank O
little O
choice O
other O
than O
to O
slam O
the O
brakes O
on O
the O
economy O
by O
drastically O
raising O
interest O
rates O
. O

Almost O
certainly O
there O
will O
be O
a O
full-blown O
recession O
. O

If O
we’re O
not O
in O
one O
yet O
, O
I O
think O
we O
will O
be O
in O
the O
next O
12 O
months O
, O
” O
Dudley B-PER
, O
the O
former O

Federal B-ORG

, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
a O
phone O
interview O

Recession O
fears O
mounted O
after O
government O
statistics O
last O
week O
showed O
the O
US B-LOC
economy O
contracted O
in O
the O
spring O
for O
the O
second O
quarter O
in O
a O
row O

Although O
Dudley B-PER
concedes O
the O
US O
economy O
has O
clearly O
slowed O
, O
he O
doesn’t O
believe O
it O
has O
weakened O
enough O
to O
qualify O
as O
a O
recession O
— O
at O
least O
not O
yet O
. O

He O
pointed O
to O
“too O
strong” O
payroll O
growth O
and O
factory O
activity. O

It’s O
not O
broad O
or O
deep O
enough O
,” O
Dudley B-PER
said O
of O
the O
slowdown O
. O
“ O

What O
we O
have O
seen O
to O
date O
is O
not O
sufficient O
by O
itself O
to O
be O
a O
recession O
.” O

The O
unemployment O
rate O
remains O
at O
3.6% O
, O
near O
the O
lowest O
levels O
in O
the O
past O
half-century O
. O

However O
, O
if O
the O
economy O
continues O
to O
weaken O
later O
this O
year O
, O
Dudley B-PER
said O
it’s O
possible O
the O
National B-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
of O
Economic B-ORG
Research I-ORG
, O
the O
official O
arbiter O
of O

, O
will O
determine O
that O
a O

did O
begin O
early O
this O

Soft O
or O
hard O

? O

Federal B-ORG

insist O
they O
can O
still O
pull O
off O
a O
so-called O

Despite O

the O

continues O
to O
grow O
steadily O
, O
albeit O
at O
a O
somewhat O
slower O
pace O
. O

We O
think O
there’s O
a O
path O
for O
us O
to O
be O
able O
to O
bring O
inflation O
down O
while O
sustaining O
a O
strong O

,” O
Federal B-ORG

Chairman O
Jerome B-PER
Powell I-PER
said O
during O
a O
press O
conference O
last O
week O
. O

Yet O
Powell B-PER
conceded O
the O
task O
has O
gotten O
trickier O
. O

We O
know O
that O
the O
path O
has O
clearly O
narrowed O
, O
really O
based O
on O
events O
that O
are O
outside O
of O
our O
control O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O

And O
it O
may O
narrow O
further O
.” O

Dudley B-PER
‘They’re O
late’ O
The O
Powell-led O
Fed B-ORG
raised O
interest O
rates O
last O
week O
by O
three-quarters O
of O
a O
percentage O
point O
at O
its O
second O
consecutive O
meeting O

Dudley B-PER
said O
the O
challenge O
for O
the O
Fed B-ORG
is O
due O
in O
part O
to O
its O
own O
poor O
forecasting O
: O
the O
central O
bank O
didn’t O
begin O
to O
raise O
interest O
rates O
until O
inflation O
was O
already O
very O
high O
. O

They O
got O
going O
really O
slowly O
Dudley B-PER
said O
. O

They’re O
late O
and O
that O
means O
they O
have O
to O
do O
more O

And O
that O
increases O
the O
risk O
of O
recession O

I O
think O
a O
recession O
is O
highly O
likely O
, O
and O
I’ll O
be O
very O
, O
very O
surprised O
if O
they O
avoid O
a O
recession O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
Dudley B-PER
is O
betting O
any O
looming O
recession O
would O
be O
“mild” O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
decline O
because O
corporate O
and O
household O
balance O
sheets O
are O
in O
decent O
shape O

He O
did O
caution O
however O
that O
continued O
high O
inflation O
means O
the O
Fed B-ORG
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
swiftly O
come O
to O
the O
rescue O
with O
interest O
rate O
cuts O
aimed O
at O
curtailing O
a O
downturn O
. O

It O
could O
last O
longer O
because O
it O
may O
be O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
can’t O
ease O
off O
the O
brakes O
too O
quickly O
, O
he O
said O

misinterpreting O
the O

from O
the O

, O
adding O
that O
he O
was O
“ O
a O
little O
bit O
puzzled O
” O
by O
the O

reaction O
. O

The O

is O
still O
far O
away O

amount O

they O

from O

he O
said O

Dudley O
added O
that O
another O
rate O
hike O
of O
three-quarters O
of O
a O
percentage O
point O
is O
still O
“potentially O
in O
play,” O
depending O
on O
how O
the O

evolves. O

He O
expects O
the O
Fed B-ORG
will O
need O
to O
raise O
interest O
rates O
to O
4% O
or O
higher O
— O
up O
from O
2.5% O

All O
of O

Dudley O
warned O
that O

a O

because O
of O
two O
key O
reasons O
, O
” O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

The O
most O
immediate O
reason O
was O
poaching O
for O
the O
illegal O
animal O
trade O
. O

The O
second O
reason O
was O
loss O
of O

. O

In O

, O
it O
was O
clear O
we O
were O
going O
to O
lose O

made O
a O

Hemley B-PER
said O
Nepal B-LOC
“really O
does O
stand O
out O
as O
a O
leader O
in O

especially O
for O

There O
is O
support O
for O
conservation O
of O
tigers O
at O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
government O
,” O
she O
said O
. O

That O
has O
translated O
into O
really O
effective O
habitat O
conservation O
, O
bolstering O
the O
protection O
of O
tigers O
in O
national O
parks O
, O
the O
wildlife O
reserves O
. O

According O
to O
Hemley B-PER
, O
one O
of O
Nepal’s B-LOC
major O
conservation O
strengths O
is O
its O
focus O
on O
wildlife O
corridors O
, O
which O
are O
forested O
pathways O
to O
help O
connect O
otherwise O
fragmented O
pieces O
of O

habitat O
. O

Nepal B-LOC
has O
been O
a O
pioneer O
in O
reforesting O
areas O
to O
make O
sure O
those O
connections O
are O
restored O
and O
maintained O
,” O
she O
explained O
. O

As O
they O
mature O
and O
move O
away O
from O
their O
parents O
, O
“tigers O
need O
to O
disperse O
. O

That O
dispersal O
is O
only O
possible O
if O
tigers O
can O
move O
around O
safely O
. O

The O
other O
key O
factor O
in O
Nepal’s B-LOC
tiger O
comeback O
is O
community O
involvement O
in O
conservation O
projects O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Communities O
are O
the O
driving O
force O
behind O
this O
” O
she O
said O

They O
are O
employed O
to O
do O
reforestation O

What’s O
really O
needed O
is O
a O
holistic O
approach,” O
she O
said. O
“ O

Monitoring O
tigers O
, O
knowing O
where O
they’re O
living O
, O
can O
help O
communities O
stay O
safer O
. O

Nepal B-LOC
has O
also O
found O
success O
with O
practical O
tools O
, O
like O
predator-proof O
fencing O
for O
livestock O
and O
lighting O
the O
perimeters O
of O
villages O
at O
night O
to O
ward O
off O
tigers O
. O

Deploying O
compensation O
programs O
for O
farmers O
whose O
livestock O
are O
killed O
by O
tigers O
also O
enables O
better O
human-tiger O
coexistence O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Conservationists O
refer O
to O
a O
concept O
known O
as O
“social O
carrying O
capacity” O
to O
describe O
the O
capacity O
for O
a O
certain O
community O
to O
tolerate O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
animals O
like O
tigers. O

Understanding O
that O
dynamic O
and O
that O
social O
carrying O
capacity O
is O
a O
new O
area O
of O
focus O
for O
us O
, O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Unless O
people O
living O
with O
tigers O
want O
them O
there O
, O
we’re O
not O
gonna O
have O
them O
there O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O

Protecting O
tigers O
also O
helps O
protect O
other O
endangered O
or O
threatened O
species O
. O

Effectively O
, O
if O
we’re O
gonna O
protect O
one O
tiger O
, O
we’re O
gonna O
protect O
10,000 O
hectares O
of O
forest O
, O
” O
said O
Hemley B-PER
. O

Tigers O
also O
live O
in O
“some O
of O
the O
most O
carbon-rich O
forests.” O

It O
will O
“help O
us O
mitigate O
climate O
change O
as O
well O
if O
we O
protect O
these O
very O
rich O
forests O
.” O

But O
while O
Nepal B-LOC
is O
a O
tiger O
success O
story O
, O
Hemley B-PER
pointed O
out O
there O
are O
still O
many O
countries O
where O
tigers O
are O
in O
“ O
crisis O
.” O

Tigers O
have O
gone O
extinct O
in O
Vietnam B-LOC
, O
Cambodia B-LOC
, O
and O
Laos B-LOC
since O
2000 O
, O
she O
said O
. O

We O
have O
to O
look O
at O
the O
elements O
that O
have O
led O
to O
success O
in O
Nepal B-LOC
and O
India B-LOC
and O
try O
to O
get O
them O
replicated O

The O
most O
important O
piece O
of O
it O
is O
political O
will O
and O
political O
leadership O

The O
United B-LOC

also O
plays O
a O

‘What O

a O

– O
120 O

150 O
minutes O

may O

Tanzi B-PER
, O
who O
was O
not O
involved O
in O
the O

, O
has O
examined O
the O
role O
of O
exercise O
in O
mice O
genetically O
bred O
to O
have O
Alzheimer’s O
disease O
and O
found O
exercise O
induces O
the O
birth O
of O
new O
neurons O
in O
the O
section O
of O
the O

most O
affected O
by O

while O
also O
boosting O

So O
often O

the O

do O
not O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
see O
that O
in O

perhaps O
do O

followed O
296 O
participants O
who O
were O
completely O

at O
the O

All O

been O

with O

the O
earliest O

are O
not O
cognitively O
normal O
, O
but O
they O
don’t O
have O
dementia O
, O
Baker B-PER

. O

They’re O
fully O
capable O
of O
taking O
care O
of O
themselves O
, O
but O
what O
they O
have O
to O
go O
through O

is O
exhausting O

“ O

They’re O
able O
to O
regroup O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
and O
accomplish O
things O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
but O
the O
toll O
is O
immense O
. O
” O

Participants O
in O
the O
study O
underwent O
cognitive O
testing O
and O
then O
were O
randomized O
into O
two O
groups O
. O

One O
group O
did O
moderate-intensity O
aerobic O
training O
on O
treadmills O
or O
stationary O
bikes O
, O
striving O
for O
a O
goal O
of O
70% O
to O
85% O
of O
heart O
rate O
reserve O
: O
“ O
That’s O
about O
120 O
heartbeats O
per O
minute O
for O
about O
30 O
to O
40 O
minutes O
for O
a O
standard O
70-year-old O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O

The O
other O
group O
did O
stretching O
, O
balance O
and O
range O
of O
motion O
exercises O
designed O
to O
allow O
them O
to O
move O
their O
body O
in O
ways O
that O
would O
help O
them O
navigate O
in O
real O
life O
. O

Folks O
in O
the O
balance-range O
of O
motion O
group O
said O
they O
were O
thrilled O
– O
they O
could O
go O
to O
soccer O
games O
with O
grandchildren O
without O
being O
concerned O
about O
tripping O
, O
or O
they O
could O
drive O
and O
turn O
their O
neck O
to O
see O
the O
back O
, O
which O
they O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
before O
, O
” O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O

Importance O
of O
support O
Both O
groups O
exercised O
twice O
a O
week O
with O
a O
personal O
trainer O
and O
then O
two O
other O
times O
weekly O
on O
their O
own O
for O
the O
first O
12 O
months O

Combined O
, O
the O
groups O
completed O
more O
than O
31,000 O
exercise O
sessions O
during O
that O
time O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
12 O
months O
, O
cognitive O
function O
had O
not O
declined O
in O
either O
group O
. O

That’s O
impressive O
, O
Baker B-PER
said O
, O
because O
a O
control O
group O
of O
equally O
matched O
people O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
– O
who O
did O
not O
exercise O
– O
did O
decline O

Studies O
have O
shown O
that O
social O
support O
is O
also O
key O
to O
improving O
brain O
health O
. O

So O
is O
it O
possible O
the O
results O
of O
the O
study O
were O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
of O
social O
support O
and O
not O
the O
exercise O
. O

Well, O
we O
don’t O
know O
for O
sure,” O
Baker B-PER
said. O

But O
there O
is O
enough O
science O
showing O
the O
benefits O
of O
exercise O
on O
brain O
health O
alone O

So O
this O
is O
not O
something O
to O
sweep O
under O
the O
carpet O
. O

And O
our O
recommendation O
would O
never O
be O
for O
people O
with O
mild O
cognitive O
impairment O
to O
do O
this O
alone O
” O
she O
added O
.” O

They O
are O
going O
to O
need O
support O

So O
exercise O
alone O
is O
not O
a O
prescription O

Exercise O
with O
support O
is O
a O
prescription O
, O
and O
that O
is O
going O
to O
be O
our O
recommendation O
. O

It O
isn’t O
often O
that O
Democrats O
look O
to O
deep-red O
Kansas B-LOC
for O
resounding O
affirmation O

But O
on O
Tuesday O
night O
, O
when O
Kansans B-LOC
overwhelmingly O
voted O
to O
keep O
protections O
for O
abortion O
rights O
in O
their O
state O
constitution O
, O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
happened O
. O

The O
size O
and O
scope O
of O
the O
result O
were O
a O
shock O
to O
even O
the O
most O
optimistic O
Democrats O

Not O
only O
did O
voters O
reject O
a O
proposed O
constitutional O
amendment O
that O
would O
have O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
strict O
abortion O
laws O
in O
the O
Republican O
state O
, O
but O
they O
did O
it O
by O
turning O
out O
in O
huge O
numbers O
, O
dwarfing O
turnout O
in O
more O
recent O
primary O
elections O
and O
signaling O
that O
the O
issue O
can O
motivate O
even O
Republican-leaning O
voters O
in O
a O
state O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
won O
by O
15 O
points O
in O
2020 O
. O

The O
political O
impact O
of O
what O
happened O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
will O
be O
most O
directly O
felt O
in O
the O
November O
midterm O
elections O
– O
particularly O
in O
races O
for O
governor O
and O
attorney O
general O
after O
the O
US B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
overturned O
Roe O
v. O
Wade O
, O
throwing O
the O
issue O
of O
abortion O
to O
the O
states O
. O

The O
June O
ruling O
has O
led O
to O
bans O
on O
the O
procedure O
being O
enforced O
in O
several O
states O
while O
opening O
the O
door O
to O
more O
restrictions O
in O
others O

At O
least O
four O
other O
states B-LOC
will O
be O
voting O
on O
abortion-related O
ballot O
measures O
this O
November O
, O
but O
Democratic B-ORG
strategists O
are O
looking O
to O
the O
Kansas B-LOC
result O
to O
extrapolate O
lessons O
for O
states O
where O
abortion O
won’t O
be O
on O
the O
ballot O
. O

As O
the O
first O
state O
to O
vote O
on O
abortion O
rights O
following O
the O
fall O
of O
Roe B-LOC
v. O
Wade I-LOC
, O
Kansas B-LOC

a O
model O

path O

will O

hoping O
to O
link O
their O
Republican B-ORG
opponents O
to O
the O

Republicans O
likewise O
will O
continue O

cautious O
on O

largely O
ignoring O
their O

long-held O

instead O
hoping O
to O
keep O

I O
think O
our O
Republican O
candidates O
are O
going O
to O
keep O
focusing O
on O
the O
issues O
most O
important O
to O

It O
is O

that O
the O

was O
a O

for O
the O

We O
already O
knew O
that O
the O
majority O
of O

support O
abortion O
rights O
, O
but O
last O
night’s O
results O

We’ll O

lean O
in O
on O
the O
threat O

The O

on O
Tuesday O

however O

also O
highlighted O
a O

relationship O

While O

Since O
the O

many O

the O
NRSC B-ORG

“ O

A O

the O

the O
result O
points O
to O
not O
just O
the O
accuracy O
of O

to O
how O

even O
in O
a O

energized O
over O

shooter O
Ethan B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
exposed O
him O
to O
years O

that O
they O
left O
him O
in O
an O
unstable O

creating O
a O
pathway O

In O
a O

prosecutors O
argued O
that O
evidence O

Crumbley I-PER

personal O
problems O
, O
including O
an O
extramarital O

be O
allowed O

be O
introduced O
at O
their O
trial O
. O

Attorneys O
for O
the O
couple O
have O
called O
the O
evidence O
“extraneous.” O

The O
parents O
were O
each O
charged O
with O
four O
counts O
of O
involuntary O
manslaughter O
after O
their O
teenage O
son O
allegedly O
shot O

killed O
four O
students O
and O
injured O
seven O
other O
people O
at O
Oxford B-LOC
High I-LOC
School I-LOC

Prosecutors O
argued O
that O
Jennifer B-PER

James B-PER
Crumbley I-PER
played O
“ O
a O
much O
larger O
role O
than O
just O
buying O
their O
son O
a O
gun O

and O
that O
there O
were O
many O
things O
the O
parents O
could O
have O
done O

simply O
locking O
up O

They O
also O
argued O
the O
parents O
had O
“every O
reason” O
to O
know O
their O
son O
was O
dangerous. O

What O
the O
evidence O
will O
actually O
show O
is O
that O
these O
defendants O
exposed O
their O
son O
to O
years O
of O
chaotic O
, O
toxic O
conflict O
, O
which O
is O
a O
well-known O
risk O
factor O
for O
entering O
the O
pathway O
to O
violence O
, O
” O
the O
filing O
states O

The O
investigation O
paints O
a O
clear O
picture O
of O
parents O
who O
were O
not O
just O
in O
constant O
conflict O
, O
or O
who O
just O
exposed O
their O
son O
to O

who O
actively O
inserted O
him O
into O

Investigators O

interviewed O

would O
consistently O
fight O
and O
drink O
to O
excess O
, O
often O
leaving O
Ethan B-PER
unsupervised O
. O

Evidence O
also O
shows O
the O
parents O
spent O
thousands O
of O
dollars O
on O
alcohol O
and O
care O
for O
horses O
and O
negligible O
amounts O
on O

My O

Prosecutors O
also O
allege O
that O
when O
Ethan B-PER

his O
mother O
took O
him O
to O
stay O
the O

with O
a O

an O

left O
him O

When O

of O
the O
parents O

When O
Ethan B-PER
went O
through O
stretches O

poor O
sleep O
or O
insomnia O
, O
he O
“complained O
of O
seeing O

in O
a O
statement. O

We O
had O
to O
carefully O
inspect O
all O
the O
measurements O
in O
the O
plume O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
were O
trustworthy O

Keeping O

Earth B-LOC
The O

Sounder O
instrument O
can O
measure O
natural O
signals O
of O
microwaves O
from O
Earth’s B-LOC
atmosphere O
and O
detect O
them O
even O
through O
thick O

MLS O
was O
the O
only O
instrument O
with O
dense O
enough O
coverage O
to O
capture O
the O
water O
vapor O
plume O
as O
it O
happened O
, O
and O
the O
only O
one O
that O
wasn’t O
affected O
by O
the O
ash O
that O
the O
volcano O
released O
, O
” O
Millán B-PER
said O
. O

The O
Aura O
satellite O
launched O
in O
2004 O
and O
since O
then O
it O
has O
only O
measured O
two O
volcanic O
eruptions O
that O
lofted O
substantial O
water O
vapor O
so O
high O
up O
in O
the O
atmosphere O

But O
the O
water O
vapor O
from O
the O
2008 O
Kasatochi O
event O
in O
Alaska B-LOC
and O
the O
2015 O
Calbuco B-LOC
eruption O
in O
Chile B-LOC
dissipated O
rather O
quickly O

Typically O
, O
powerful O
volcanic O
eruptions O
like O
Mount B-LOC
Pinatubo I-LOC
or O
the O
1883 O
Krakatoa B-LOC
event O
in O
Indonesia B-LOC
cool O
Earth’s O
surface O
temperature O
because O
the O
gas O
, O
dust O
and O
ash O
they O
spew O
reflects O
sunlight O
into O
space O
. O

This O
volcanic O
winter O
happened O
after O
the O
Mount B-LOC
Tambora I-LOC
eruption O
in O
1815 O
, O
triggering O
the O
year O
without O
a O
summer O
in O
1816 O
. O

The O
Tonga B-LOC
eruption O
was O
different O
because O
the O
water O
vapor O
it O
sent O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
can O
trap O
heat O
which O
could O
cause O
warmer O
surface O
temperatures O

The O
excess O
water O
vapor O
could O
stay O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
for O
several O
years O
, O
according O
to O
the O
researchers O
. O

The O
additional O
water O
vapor O
in O
the O
stratosphere O
could O
also O
lead O
to O
chemical O
reactions O
that O
temporarily O
contribute O
to O
the O
depletion O
of O
Earth’s O
protective O
ozone O

Anatomy O
of O
an O
eruption O
Fortunately O
, O
the O
warming O
effect O
of O
the O
water O
vapor O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
small O
and O
temporary O
, O
and O
will O
dissipate O
as O
the O
extra O
vapor O
diminishes O

The O
researchers O
don’t O
believe O
it O
will O
be O
enough O
to O
exacerbate O
existing O
conditions O
due O
to O
the O
climate O
crisis O

The O
researchers O
believe O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
amount O
of O
lofted O
water O
vapor O
was O
due O
to O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
volcano’s O
caldera O
490 O
feet O
( O
150 O
meters O
) O
below O
the O
ocean’s O
surface O

If O
it O
was O
too O
deep O
, O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
ocean O
would O
have O
muted O
the O
eruption O
, O
and O
it O
was O
too O
shallow O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
seawater O
heated O
by O
the O
erupting O
magma O
wouldn’t O
have O
matched O
what O
reached O
the O
stratosphere O
, O
the O
researchers O
said O
. O

Scientists O
are O
still O
working O
to O
understand O
the O
unusually O
energetic O
eruption O
and O
all O
of O
its O
superlatives O
, O
including O
hurricane-strength O
winds O
that O
reached O
space O

response O

states O
that O
the O

that O

Taylor B-PER
called O
Musk’s B-PER
claims O
“factually O
inaccurate, O
legally O
insufficient, O
and O
commercially O
irrelevant.” O

In O
its O
response O
, O
Twitter B-ORG
takes O
issue O
with O
Musk B-PER
’s O
analysis O
of O
spam O
bots O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
“firehose” O
of O
data O
he O
used O
“reflects O
many O
Twitter B-ORG
accounts O
that O
are O
not O
included O
in O

and O
that O
the O
Botometer B-ORG
tool O
he O
used O
relies O
on O
a O
different O
process O
than O
the O
company O
to O
determine O
whether O
an O
account O
may O
be O
a O
bot O
. O

It O
added O
that O
Botometer B-ORG
“ O
earlier O
this O

himself O

The O
back-and-forth O
between O
Twitter B-ORG
and O
Musk B-PER
offers O
a O
preview O
of O
the O
arguments O
each O
side O
will O
make O
when O
the O
case O
goes O
to O

assuming O
they O
don’t O
agree O

a O
settlement O
first O

A O
five-day O
trial O
is O
set O
to O
kick O
off O
on O
October O
17 O
, O
after O
Twitter B-ORG
had O
pressed O
to O
expedite O
the O
proceedings O
. O

Musk O
last O
month O
moved O
to O
terminate O
his O
agreement O
to O
buy O
Twitter B-ORG
, O
accusing O
the O
company O
of O
breaching O
the O
deal O
by O
making O
misleading O
statements O
about O
the O
number O
of O
bot O
accounts O
on O
its O
platform O
and O
withholding O
information O
that O
he O
claims O
could O
help O
him O
evaluate O
the O
issue O
. O

Days O
later O
, O
Twitter B-ORG
filed O
a O
lawsuit O
against O
the O
billionaire O
, O
alleging O
that O
he’d O
violated O
the O
agreement O
and O
asking O
a O
court O
to O
compel O
him O
to O
follow O
through O
with O
the O
deal O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
doubling O
down O
on O
concerns O
about O
bot O
accounts O
, O
Musk B-PER
’s O
responses O
also O
criticized O
Twitter B-ORG
’s O
use O
of O
monetizable O
daily O
active O
users O
, O
a O
metric O
Twitter B-ORG
publicly O
reports O
to O
advertisers O
and O
shareholders O
to O
represent O
its O
growth O
. O

Musk B-PER
claims O
that O
his O
evaluations O
show O
only O
a O
small O
portion O
of O
the O
users O
Twitter B-ORG
considers O
mDAU O
actually O
generate O
significant O
revenue O
for O
the O
company O
by O
viewing O
and O
engaging O
with O
advertisements O
, O
alleging O
that O
the O
measure O
is O
not O
actually O
as O
good O
an O
indicator O
of O
future O
revenue O
growth O
potential O
and O
long-term O
performance O
as O
Twitter’s B-ORG
public O

imply O
. O

Twitter B-ORG
also O
does O
not O
publish O
the O
methodology O
it O
follows O
to O
determine O
its O
mDAU O
count O
, O
or O
how O
it O
excludes O
nonmonetizable O
accounts O
from O
that O
metric O
, O
Musk B-PER
’s O
answer O
states O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
difficult O
for O
any O
third O
party O
to O
completely O
recreate O
Twitter’s B-ORG
mDAU O
calculations O
. O

Musk’s O
answer O
alleges O
Twitter B-ORG
leadership O
has O
incentives O
to O
report O
“high O
mDAU O
numbers O
to O
stoke O
investor O
interest” O
and O
because O
its O
executive O
compensation O
structure O
is O
based O
partly O
on O
mDAU O

In O
its O
answer O
, O
Musk’s B-PER
team O
explains O
that O
the O
billionaire O
is O
concerned O
with O
the O
spam O
bot O
issue O
because O
“ O
transitioning O
users O
who O
do O
not O
generate O
any O
revenue O
into O
more O
active O
users O
… O
is O
no O
easy O
task O
.” O

Musk’s O
team O
adds O
: O
“ O
A O
company O
focused O
on O
adding O
these O
active O
users O
would O
invest O
substantial O
resources O
towards O
trying O
to O
improve O
Twitter B-ORG
to O
maximize O
engagement O
, O
such O
as O
by O
effectively O
targeting O
spam O
or O
false O
accounts O
. O
” O

Twitter B-ORG
said O
in O
its O
response O
to O
Musk’s B-PER
counterclaims O
that O
its O
mDAU O
count O
has O
never O
purported O
to O
show O
how O
many O
users O
generate O
significant O
revenue O
by O
interacting O
with O
ads O
, O
but O
rather O
shows O
the O
number O
of O
real O
users O
who O
could O
be O
monetized O
by O
being O
shown O
ads O
. O

It O
also O
noted O
that O
Musk’s O
mDAU-related O
claims O
were O
not O
included O
in O
his O
initial O
termination O
filing O
and O
“are O
a O
newly O
invented O
litigating O
position.” O

The O
company O
also O
continues O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
issue O
of O
bots O
is O
not O
, O
and O
has O
never O
been O
, O
germane O
to O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
acquisition O
deal O
. O

Musk O
has O
received O
massive O
amounts O
of O
information O
from O
Twitter B-ORG
, O
for O
months O
, O
and O
has O
been O
unable O
to O
find O
a O
valid O
excuse O
to O
back O
out O
of O
the O

Reporters O
who O
cover O
sensitive O
beats O
sometimes O
have O
a O
sense O
when O
big O
news O
is O
about O
to O
break O

But O
not O
this O
time O

The O
FBI B-ORG
’s O
Monday O
morning O
search O
of O
Mar-a-Lago B-LOC
– O
a O
thunderclap O
in O
American B-LOC
political O
history O
– O
happened O
so O
quietly O
, O
so O
secretly O
, O
that O
it O
wasn’t O
caught O
on O
camera O
at O
all O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
reporters O
didn’t O
catch O
wind O
of O
the O
FBI B-ORG
action O
until O
after O
it O
was O
over O

By O
the O
time O
local O
TV O
news O
cameras O
showed O
up O
outside O
the O
club O
, O
there O
was O
almost O
nothing O
to O
see O
. O

Websites O
used O
file O
photos O
of O
the O
Florida B-LOC
resort O
since O
there O
were O
no O
dramatic O
shots O
of O
the O
search O

What O
everyone O
wants O
to O
see O
is O
the O
search O
warrant O

As O
Elie B-PER
Honig I-PER
pointed O
out O
right O
away O
on O
CNN B-ORG
, O
“ O
in O
order O
to O
get O
a O
search O
warrant O
in O
the O
federal O
system O
, O
prosecutors O
have O
to O
establish O
probable O
cause O
that O
a O
crime O
was O
committed O
, O
” O
and O
a O
judge O
has O
to O
sign O
off O
. O

The O
warrant O
may O
become O
public O
later O

But O
for O
the O
time O
being O
we’re O
only O
seeing O
leaks O
from O
anonymous O
sources O
; O
interpretations O
from O
analysts O
; O
and O
incendiary O
responses O
from O
Trump B-PER
family O
members O
, O
friends O
and O
supporters O
. O

Mark B-PER
Levin I-PER
said O
on O
Fox B-ORG
that O
“this O
is O
the O
worst O
attack O
on O
this O
republic O
in O
modern O
history O
, O
period O
. O

The O
hyperbolic O
, O
man-the-battle-stations O
reactions O
are O
a O
big O
part O
of O
the O
story O
because O
they O
showcase O
where O
GOP O
leaders O
and O
stars O
stand O
– O
solidly O
right O
next O
to O
Trump B-PER
regardless O
of O
potential O
wrongdoing O
. O

First O
four O
hours O
of O
coverage O
This O
feels O
like O
a O
“where O
were O
you O
when?” O

moment O
of O
the O
Trump B-ORG
era O
– O
an O
era O
that O
is O
very O
much O
overlapping O
with O
the O
Biden B-ORG
era O

But O
its O
ultimate O
level O
of O
import O
is O
impossible O
to O
judge O
right O
now O

So O
here O
are O
some O
notes O
about O
the O
first O
four O
hours O
of O
media O
coverage O
: O
– O
Trump B-PER
tried O
to O
manage O
the O
news O
by O
announcing O
it O
himself O
in O
a O
lengthy O
screed O
. O

Trump O
and O
some O
of O
his O
allies O
“have O
a O
long-standing O
habit O
of O
conflating O
legal O
problems O
with O
PR O
problems,” O
Maggie B-PER
Haberman I-PER
said O
on O
CNN. B-ORG

At O
the O
moment O
, O
they O
are O
treating O
this O
like O
it’s O
a O
PR O
problem O
, O
” O
she O
added O
, O
“ O
but O
it’s O
a O
legal O
problem O
… O
– O
Within O
an O
hour O
, O
sources O
told O
reporters O
that O
the O
search O
warrant O
was O
related O
to O
an O
investigation O
into O
the O

that O
may O

Symptoms O
of O
vasculitis O
Vasculitis O
occurs O
when O
the O
body’s O
immune O
system O
attacks O
veins O
, O
arteries O
and O
small O
capillaries O
. O

The O
resulting O
inflammation O
narrows O
those O
blood O
vessels O
and O
restricts O
the O
flow O
of O
blood O
or O
even O
cuts O
blood O
flow O
off O
entirely O
, O
possibly O
causing O
organ O
damage O
or O
creating O
aneurysms O
( O
a O
bulge O
in O
the O
wall O
of O
a O
blood O
vessel O
) O
, O
according O
to O
the O
National B-ORG
Institutes I-ORG
of O
Health I-ORG
. O

If O
an O
aneurysm O
bursts O
, O
it O
can O
cause O
internal O
bleeding O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
death O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
specific O
type O
and O
severity O
of O
the O
condition O
and O
which O
organs O
are O
targeted O
, O
symptoms O
of O
vasculitis O
vary O
and O
can O
be O
mild O
, O
moderate O
or O
life-threatening O
. O

Common O
symptoms O
include O
loss O
of O
appetite O
, O
weight O
loss O
, O
fatigue O
, O
rash O
, O
aches O
, O
pains O
and O

Age O

family O
history O
and O
lifestyle O
factors O
such O
as O
smoking O
and O
illegal O
drug O
use O
can O
contribute O
to O
the O
risk O
for O
vasculitis O

Certain O
medications O
for O
high O
blood O
pressure O
, O
thyroid O
disease O
and O
infections O
can O
contribute O
as O
well O
, O
the O
NIH B-ORG
noted O

Vasculitis O
can O
occur O
alone O
or O
in O
conjunction O
with O
other O
rheumatic O
diseases O
, O
such O
as O
rheumatoid O
arthritis O
, O
lupus O
or O

Treatment O
is O

since O
the O
creation O
of O
Warner B-ORG

this O
spring O
. O

However O
, O
it’s O
a O
notable O
move O
considering O
that O
the O
service O
would O
be O
a O
heavy O
hitter O
in O
scripted O
entertainment O
with O
HBO B-ORG
and O
in O
the O
unscripted O

on O
Tuesday O
, O
according O
to O

member O
Rep. O
Zoe B-PER

The O

CNN B-ORG
has O
previously O
reported O
on O
Pompeo’s B-PER
negotiations O
with O
the O
committee O
about O
his O
testimony O

The O
panel O
has O
shown O
an O
increased O
interest O
in O
members O
of O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
’s O
Cabinet O
, O
particularly O
regarding O
conversations O
among O

about O
invoking O
the O

after O
January O
6 O
, O
2021 O
, O
and O
the O
committee’s O
focus O
in O
the O
Pompeo B-PER
interview O
was O
expected O
to O
be O
on O
the O
25th O
Amendment O
, O
the O
source O
said O

A O
portion O
of O
the O
25th O
Amendment O
, O
which O
addresses O
presidential O
succession O
, O
allows O
a O
vice O
president O
and O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
Cabinet O
to O
vote O
to O
remove O
a O
president O
from O
office O
due O
to O
his O
inability O
to O
“discharge O
the O
powers O
and O
duties O
of O
his O
office O
.” O

Pompeo B-PER
served O
as O
CIA B-ORG
director O
for O
the O
first O
year O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
presidency O
, O
and O
led O
the O
State B-ORG

for O
Trump’s B-PER
final O
three O
years O
, O
where O
he O
was O
a O
stalwart O
Trump B-PER
ally O
and O
defender O
. O

Lofgren O
refused O
to O
comment O
on O
the O
particulars O
of O
Pompeo’s B-PER
testimony O
in O
an O
interview O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
but O
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Wolf B-PER
Blitzer I-PER
on O
“ O
The O

” O
that O
“ O
he O
came O
in O
willingly O
, O
and O
he O
did O
answer O
questions O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

When O
asked O
if O
the O
committee O
learned O
any O
new O
information O
from O
Pompeo’s B-PER
testimony O
, O
Lofgren B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
I O
think O
we O
fill O
in O
a O
few O
pieces O
here O

there O
each O

Obviously O

we O

ve O
had O

what O
he O
said O

did O
. O

And O
so O
it’s O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
filling O
out O
the O
entire O
picture O
, O
especially O
on O
that O
day O
and O
the O

subsequent O
to O
that O

where O
the O

He O
also O
chartered O

a O

earlier O

to O
be O
an O
alternative O

The O
efforts O
to O
buy O
time O
come O
as O
the O

faces O
a O
flurry O
of O
legal O
issues O
and O
regulatory O
scrutiny O
amid O
what O
experts O
have O
warned O
are O
red O
flags O
about O
the O
transaction O

In O
late O
June O
, O
Digital B-ORG
World I-ORG
, O
revealed O
its O
board O
members O
have O
received O
subpoenas O
from O
a O
federal O
grand O
jury O
in O
the O
Southern B-LOC
District I-LOC
of O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
related O
to O
due O
diligence O
regarding O
the O
deal O
. O

Both O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
and O
Securities B-ORG
and O
Exchange I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
are O
investigating O
the O
transaction O
. O

While O
we O
are O
using O
our O
best O
efforts O
to O
complete O
the O
business O
combination O
as O
soon O
as O
practicable O
, O
our O
board O
of O
directors O
believes O
there O
will O
not O
be O
sufficient O
time O
before O
the O
termination O
date O
, O
” O
Digital B-ORG
World I-ORG
said O
in O
the O
new O
filing O
. O

That’s O
why O
Digital B-ORG
World I-ORG
is O
asking O
shareholders O
to O
extend O
the O
deadline O
until O
September B-LOC
8 O
2023 O
. O

Without O
the O
extension O
, O
the O
shell O
company O
said O
it O
may O
be O
“ O
forced O
to O
liquidate O
” O
without O
a O
deal O
in O
hand O
. O

The O
DOJ B-ORG
and O
SEC B-ORG
investigations O
have O
served O
as O
major O
roadblocks O
to O
getting O
the O
deal O
consummated O
, O
according O
to O
the O
filing O
. O

We O
have O
experienced O
a O
number O
of O
regulatory O
delays O
, O
and O
we O
and O
TMTG B-ORG
may O
continue O
to O
experience O
additional O
delays O
in O
the O
future O
, O
” O
Digital B-ORG
World I-ORG
said O
in O
the O
filing O
. O

These O
delays O
could O
cause O
us O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
consummate O
the O
business O
combination O
. O

The O
filing O
indicates O
the O
regulatory O
headwinds O
facing O
the O
Trump B-PER
deal O
are O
“formidable” O
and O
“really O
hits O
home O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
deal O
is O
terminated O
due O
to O
regulatory O
headwinds,” O
said O
Matthew B-PER
Kennedy I-PER
, O
senior O
IPO O
market O
strategist O
at O
Renaissance B-ORG
Capital I-ORG
. O

The O
SEC B-ORG
and O
DOJ B-ORG
are O
not O
known O
for O
moving O
fast O
or O
trying O
to O
speed O
things O
along O
to O
help O
the O
SPAC O
, O
” O
Kennedy B-PER
said O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
indefinite O
delays O
can O
increase O
the O
likelihood O
that O
the O
deal O
is O
essentially O
terminated O
. O

visit O
Taiwan B-LOC
during O
an O
Asia B-LOC

conversation O

churned O
with O
nationalist O
furor O
and O
amped-up O
rhetoric O
on O
what O
the O
leadership O
could O
do O
about O
it O
. O

Beijing B-LOC
had O
earlier O
threatened O
Washington B-LOC
that O
those O
who O
“play O
with O
fire” O
over O
Taiwan B-LOC
would O
“perish,” O
and O
warned O
the O
US O
against O
crossing O
a O
“red O

saying O
the O
Chinese O
military O
would O
“not O
sit O
idly O

Pelosi B-PER
visited O
the O
self-governing O
island, O

China’s O

Pelosi B-PER

landed O
on O

where O
they O
were O
greeted O
in O
a O

Why O
the O
‘dollar O
smile’ O
leads O
to O
frowns O
The O
US B-ORG
dollar O
tends O
to O
climb O
in O
value O
when O
America’s B-LOC
economy O
is O
very O
strong O
, O
or O
, O
somewhat O
counterintuitively O
, O
when O
it’s O
weak O
and O
the O
world O
is O
facing O
a O
recession O

In O
either O
situation O
, O
investors O
view O
the O
country’s O
currency O
as O
an O
opportunity O

lock O

a O

The O
phenomenon O

, O
head O

identified O
three O

that O

hurt O
countries O

the O

with O

It O
can O
add O
fiscal O
strain O

Not O
every O
country O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
borrow O
money O
in O
their O

, O
since O
foreign O

may O
not O
have O
faith O
in O
their O
institutions O
or O
they O
have O
less O
developed O
financial O
markets O
. O

That O
means O
some O
have O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
issue O
debt O
denominated O
in O
dollars O

But O
if O
the O
value O
of O
the O
dollar O
shoots O
up O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
more O
expensive O
to O
repay O
their O
liabilities O
, O
draining O
government O
coffers O
. O

It O
also O
makes O
it O
costlier O
for O

food O

That’s O
what O
happened O
when O
the O
value O
of O
Sri B-LOC

crashed O
against O
the O

earlier O

even O
those O
who O
weren’t O
expressed O
skepticism O
about O
the O

But O
the O
majority O
said O
they O
had O
issues O
with O
the O

ranging O
from O
“ O

the O
fact O
that O

their O

it’s O

according O
to O
a O
person O

telling O
the O

a O
good O

at O

The O

Advisers O
had O
relayed O
to O

long O
before O
Tuesday’s O
primary O
that O
for O
his O

to O
make O
a O
difference O
, O
he O
would O
need O

it O
well O

As O

many O
of O
those O
in O

circle O
believed O
he O
had O
decided O
to O
sit O
out O
the O

The O
conversations O
around O
the O
GOP O
primary O
in O
Missouri B-LOC
began O

who O
had O
sought O

The O

spoke O
to O
both O
Greitens B-PER

Schmitt B-PER
in O
the O
hours O
before O
he O
made O
his O

Two O
sources O
close O
to O
Trump B-PER
suggested O
his O
omission O
of O
a O
last O
name O
in O
the O
endorsement O
was O
done O
deliberately O
to O
avoid O
throwing O
his O
full O
weight O
behind O
Greitens B-PER

Afterward O
, O
both O
Greitens B-PER
and O
Schmitt B-PER
sought O
to O
lay O
claim O
to O
Trump’s B-PER
endorsement O
. O
Greitens B-PER
said O
he O
was O
“honored O
to O
receive” O
Trump’s B-PER
endorsement O
, O
calling O
himself O
“the O

in O

For O
his O

Schmitt B-PER
said O
it O
was O
“ O

Basically O
everyone O

so O
you’d O

would O
be O
tempting O

Instead, O
they’re O
doing O
the O
complete O

The O
vodka O
brand O
is O
selling O
a O
completely O
empty O
can O
that O
encourages O
customers O
to O
make O
canned O
cocktails O
however O
they O
like O
them O
, O
preferably O
with O
Tito’s B-PER
vodka O
. O

Tito’s O
in O
a O
Can” O
is O
just O
that…almost: O
It’s O
a O
16-ounce, O
refillable O
can O
that O
costs O
$20 O
that’s O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
cheeky O
knock O
at O
the O
ever-growing O
cocktail-to-go O
trend. O

Despite O
the O
flood O
of O
different O
flavors O
and O
variations O

we’ve O
always O
believed O
the O
idea O

The O

has O
so O
far O

that’s O

Tito’s O
has O
grown O
in O
popularity O
since O
the O
Texas-based O
brand O
began O
in O
1995 O

The O
family-owned O
company O
doesn’t O
reveal O
sales O
figures O
, O
but O
Tito’s B-ORG
is O
one O
of O
the O
country’s O
top-selling O
vodka O
brands O
. O

Still O
, O
as O
consumers O
crave O
convenience O
and O
new O
flavors O
, O
ready-to-drink O
cocktails O
have O
exploded O
in O
popularity O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

Sales O
of O
premixed O
cocktails O
grew O
more O
than O
40% O
last O

, O

revealed O
, O
soaring O
past O
$1.6 O
billion O
in O
sales O
and O
becoming O
second O
only O
to O

terms O
of O

But O

Ultimately O
, O
from O

brand O
standpoint O
, O
[ O
we’re O
] O
holding O
true O
to O
what O
we O
know O
and O
the O
strategy O
we’ve O
had O
from O
the O
beginning O
— O
making O
vodka O
, O
he O
said O
. O
“ O

There’s O
an O
element O
of O
this O
brand O
not O
being O
sellouts O
. O

We’ve O
all O
experienced O
it O
before O

You O
go O
to O
rent O
a O
car O
and O
you’re O
handed O
a O
laundry O
list O
of O
coverage O
options O
— O
all O
with O
a O
price O
tag O
attached O

You O
want O
to O
ensure O
you’re O
covered O
, O
but O
you O
also O
aren’t O
looking O
forward O
to O
spending O
even O
more O
on O
your O
car O
rental O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there’s O
often O
a O
different O
option O
: O
your O
credit O
card O
travel O
insurance O
. O

There O
are O
many O
credit O
cards O
that O
will O
actually O
provide O
you O
with O
car O
rental O
coverage O
as O
long O
as O
you O
use O
the O
card O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
rental O
. O

This O
largely O
unknown O
perk O
could O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
save O
you O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
money O
on O
your O
next O
car O
rental O
. O

Additionally O
, O
some O
credit O
cards O
even O
offer O
special O
perks O
, O
such O
as O
car O
rental O
elite O
status O
and O
discounts O
. O

But O
not O
all O
credit O
cards O
offer O
coverage O
, O
and O
some O
offer O
better O
coverage O
than O
others O
. O

So O
before O
you O
rent O
your O
next O
car O
— O
whether O
it’s O
on O
vacation O
or O
just O
around O
town O
— O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
best O
credit O
card O
in O
your O
pocket O
to O
ensure O
you’re O
covered O

Best O
credit O
cards O
for O
car O
rentals O
in O
2022 O
How O
does O
credit O
card O
car O
rental O
insurance O
work O
? O

First O
and O
foremost O
, O
when O
renting O
a O
car O
, O
you O
must O
pay O
for O
your O
rental O
with O
the O
specific O
credit O
card O
that O
offers O
car O
rental O
protection O
. O

And, O
if O
there O
are O
multiple O
drivers O
on O
the O
rental O
contract, O
the O
primary O
renter O
must O
be O
the O
card O
holder. O

Additionally O
, O
for O
the O
credit O
card O
coverage O
to O
take O
effect O
in O
the O
unfortunate O
case O
that O
an O
accident O
occurs O
, O
you O
must O
decline O
the O
Collision B-ORG
Damage I-ORG
Waiver I-ORG
( O
CDW O
) O
— O
sometimes O
called O
Loss B-ORG
Damage I-ORG
Waiver I-ORG
( O
LDW O
) O
— O
in O
your O
rental O
agreement O
. O

You O
might O
find O
that O
some O
car O
rental O
companies O
automatically O
include O
this O
extra O
insurance O
— O
and O
cost O
— O
into O
your O
agreement O
, O
so O
you’ll O
want O
to O
double-check O
your O
paperwork O
. O

Once O
you O
rent O
the O
car O
, O
you’ll O
then O
be O
covered O
if O
your O
rented O
car O
incurs O
theft O
or O
damage O
from O
a O
collision O
. O

This O
coverage O
will O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
financial O
responsibility O
of O
covering O
the O
cost O

However O
, O
the O
included O
policy O
will O
not O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
cost O
of O
damage O
or O
injuries O
to O
another O
car O
if O
you’re O
found O
at O
fault O
. O

Typically O
, O
your O
personal O
car O
rental O
insurance O
will O
cover O
you O
in O
these O
situations O
or O
you O
can O
purchase O
separate O
policies O
from O
the O
car O
rental O
company O
. O

You’ll O
also O
notice O
that O
there O
are O
two O
different O
types O
of O
credit O
card O
car O
rental O
coverage O
: O
primary O
and O
secondary O
. O

Primary O
coverage O
means O
that O
if O
there’s O
a O
covered O
accident O
, O
the O
claim O
will O
go O
directly O
through O
the O
credit O
card O
company O
, O
allowing O
you O
to O
avoid O
the O
hassle O
of O
involving O
your O
own O
auto O
insurance O
policy O
. O

This O
will O
not O
only O
save O
you O
time O
but O
will O
also O
avoid O
any O
premiums O
to O
your O
own O
policy O

If O
the O
credit O
card O
offers O
secondary O
car O
rental O
insurance O
, O
you’ll O
have O
to O
first O
make O
a O
claim O
with O
any O
other O
policy O
you O
have O
. O

Once O
the O
claim O
is O
settled O
, O
you O
can O
then O
file O
a O
claim O
with O
your O
credit O
card O
and O
you’ll O
be O
covered O
for O
anything O
that O
wasn’t O
initially O
covered O
with O
your O
primary O
policy O
, O
such O
as O
your O
deductible O
. O

However O
, O
one O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
many O
credit O
cards O
that O
offer O
secondary O
coverage O
switch O
to O
primary O
coverage O
if O
you O
don’t O
have O
car O
insurance O
or O
if O
you’re O
renting O
outside O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
where O
your O
personal O
policy O
won’t O
cover O
you O
. O

You’ll O
also O
find O
that O
many O
coverage O
options O
are O
slightly O
different O
from O
one O
another O

Some O
policies O
will O
only O
cover O
you O
to O
the O
maximum O
value O
of O
the O
car O
you’re O
renting O
, O
while O
others O
have O
higher O
limits O
. O

Many O
policies O
will O
also O
only O
cover O
you O
for O
a O
certain O
time O
period O
— O
31 O
days O
is O
very O
common O

So O
if O
you’re O
renting O
a O
car O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
you O
might O
find O
that O
your O
credit O
card O
coverage O
will O
not O
actually O
apply O
. O

Additionally O
, O
there O
are O
some O
car O
types O
that O
aren’t O
covered O
, O
such O
as O
luxury O
cars O
and O
pick-up O
trucks O
. O

You’ll O
also O
find O
that O
some O
countries O
are O
excluded O
, O
and O
while O
the O
list O
changes O
depending O
on O
the O
card O
issuer O
, O
Australia B-LOC
, O
New B-LOC
Zealand I-LOC
, O
Italy B-LOC
and O
Jamaica B-LOC
are O
some O
common O
countries O
to O
look O
out O
for O
. O

With O
that O
in O
mind O
, O
let’s O
take O
a O
look O
at O
our O
seven O
picks O
for O
the O
best O
cards O
for O

. O

Whether O
it’s O
because O
of O
the O
card’s O
insurance O
protections O
or O
additional O
benefits O
, O
some O
cards O
are O
better O
than O
others O

built O
their O

around O
the O
South B-LOC

But O
as O
an O
intense O
and O
widespread O
drought O
digs O
into O
the O
High B-LOC

, O
flows O
have O
decreased O

Unwilling O
to O
leave O
things O
to O
chance O
, O
Nebraska B-LOC
has O
taken O
action O
by O
invoking O
the O
fine O
print O
of O
a O
century-old O
water O
compact O
between O
the O
two O
states O
— O
and O
sparking O
new O
tension O
in O
the O
process O
. O

Nebraska B-LOC
Gov. O
Pete B-PER
Ricketts I-PER
in O
April O
signed O
legislation O
that O
within O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
compact O
, O
would O
allow O
Nebraska B-LOC
to O
build O
a O
canal O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
to O
siphon O
water O
off O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

In O
response O
, O
Colorado B-LOC
Gov. O
Jared B-PER
Polis I-PER
described O
the O
plan O
as O
a O
“costly O
and O
misguided O
political O
stunt O
. O

But O
it’s O
a O
conflict O
climatologists O
say O
could O
play O
out O
more O
often O
as O
drought O
expands O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
and O
Central B-LOC
US B-LOC
, O
draining O
water O
supplies O
and O
exacerbating O
strains O
between O
urban O
growth O
and O
agriculture O
. O

We O
go O
through O
droughts O
every O
20 O
years O
or O
so O
, O
but O
nothing O
of O
this O
magnitude O
, O

We O
are O
in O
for O
a O
wave O
of O
water O
rights O
battles O
through O
the O
West B-LOC

This O
is O
the O
driest O
it O
has O
been O
in O
1,200 O
years O
. O

Who O
has O
the O
right O
? O

The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
runs O
from O
the O
Rocky B-LOC
Mountains I-LOC
in O
Colorado B-LOC
, O
through O
Denver B-LOC

Along O
the O

, O
the O

to O
miles O
of O
farms O
and O
ranches O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
Colorado-Nebraska B-LOC
border O
. O

But O
much O
of O
that O
land O
is O
now O
brown O

Concerns O
about O
how O
much O
water O
– O
or O
how O
little O
– O
is O
flowing O
down O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
led O
Ricketts B-PER
to O
announce O
the O
$500 O
million O
plan O
to O
build O
a O
canal O
on O
Colorado B-LOC
land O
to O
funnel O
water O
into O
a O
Nebraska B-LOC
reservoir O
system O
during O
the O
non-irrigation O
months O
in O
the O
fall O
and O

Without O
this O
compact O
and O
our O
ability O
to O
enforce O
our O
rights O
, O
we O
will O
see O
the O
dramatic O
impact O
upon O
our O
state O
, O
” O
Ricketts B-PER
said O
in O
an O
April O
press O
conference O
, O
pointing O
to O
Colorado’s B-LOC
ever-growing O
population O
and O
its O
estimate O
of O
nearly O
$ O
10 O
billion O
for O
282 O
new O
projects O
along O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
. O
“ O

Should O
all O
the O
long-term O
goals O
be O
affected O
, O
they O
would O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
water O
flows O
coming O
to O
the O
state O
of O
Nebraska B-LOC
by O
90 O
%. O

That O
rationale O
raised O
eyebrows O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
. O

The O
fact O
is O
, O
many O
of O
those O
projects O
are O
not O
necessarily O
going O
to O
come O
to O
fruition O
, O
” O
Kevin B-PER
Rein I-PER
, O
Colorado’s B-LOC
state O
engineer O
and O
director O
of O
the O
Colorado B-LOC
Division B-ORG
of O
Water B-ORG
Resources I-ORG
, O
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
noting O
that O
the O
state O
curtails O
usage O
based O
on O
water-rights O
seniority O
to O
ensure O
that O
Nebraska B-LOC
still O
gets O
the O
water O
it O
has O
the O
right O
to O
. O

In O
the O
99-year O
history O
of O
the O
compact O
, O
we O
have O
complied O
with O
those O
provisions O
of O
the O
compact O
, O
” O
Rein B-PER
said O
. O

They O
are O
getting O
what O
they O
agreed O
to O
.” O

Despite O
the O
population O
growth O
in O
Denver B-LOC
, O
Rein O
said O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
water O
used O
has O
decreased O
because O
of O
conservation O
efforts O
. O

However O
, O
the O
state O
acknowledges O
future O
expansion O
could O
impact O
supplies O
. O

“ O
Development O
along O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
could O
begin O
to O
diminish O
flows O
as O
they O
travel O
down O
the O
river O
toward O
the O
lower O
section O
of O
the O
river O
and O
ultimately O
Nebraska B-LOC
, O
” O
Rein B-PER
said O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
building O
a O
canal O
would O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
Colorado B-LOC
water O
rights O
, O
Rein B-PER
said O
. O

But O
overall O
he O
believes O
the O
compact O
is O
good O
for O
Colorado B-LOC
. O

It’s O
really O
two O
states O
getting O
along O
,” O
he O
explained O
. O

What O
we O
have O
is O
good O
for O
farmers O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
and O
good O
for O
farmers O
in O
Nebraska B-LOC
in O
that O
region O
that O
are O
part O
of O
a O
community O
and O
work O
together O

And O
they’re O
the O
ones O
that O
could O
be O
impacted O
. O

The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
River I-LOC
Compact O
allows O
Nebraska B-LOC
500 O
cubic O

some O

in O
the O

Jay B-PER

, O
a O

fifth-generation O
rancher O
in O
this O
corner O
of O

history O
literally O
stretches O
across O

Goddard’s O

bears O
a O
two-and-a-half-mile O
scar O
from O
when O
Nebraska B-LOC
began O
— O
but O
never O
finished O
— O
digging O
a O
Perkins B-LOC

more O
than O
a O
century O

Well O
, O
obviously O
, O
nobody O
wants O
to O
lose O
any O
of O
their O
property O
, O
” O
Goddard B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
while O
walking O
along O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
ditch O
, O
with O
the O
interstate O
highway O
and O
Nebraska B-LOC
visible O
in O
the O
distance O
. O

The O
ground O
on O
his O
ranch O
is O
dry O
and O
brittle O
. O

There’s O
usually O
water O
standing O
in O
some O
of O
these O
lagoons O
and O
they’re O
completely O
dry O
right O
now O
. O

He’s O
also O
concerned O
about O
the O
impacts O
of O
the O
canal O
on O
the O
overall O
health O
of O
the O
river O

I O
hope O
it O
doesn’t O
knock O
down O
the O
flow O
during O
the O
wintertime O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hunters O
that O
come O
to O
this O
area O

We O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
wildlife O
— O
whether O
geese O
, O
turkey O
, O
deer O
and O
ducks O
— O
that O
come O
through O
on O
a O
migration O
and O
so O
I’m O
worried O
that O
it O
will O
dry O
up O
the O
river O
at O
the O
wrong O
time O
, O
” O
Goddard B-PER
said O
. O

Not O
only O
would O
that O
hurt O
Julesburg B-LOC
’s O
tourism O
and O
economy O
, O
but O
it O
would O
also O
impact O
its O
neighbors O
’ O
businesses O
as O
well O
. O

Goddard B-PER
explained O
that O
the O
border O
is O
porous O
, O
with O
many O
— O
like O
him O
— O
having O
operations O
in O
both O
states O
. O

I O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
my O
[agriculture] O
producers O
and O
the O
folks O
that O
bank O
on O
our O
[agriculture] O
lending O
side O
are O
taken O
care O
of O
well O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
line O
Goddard B-PER
said O

Just O
on O
the O
other O
side O
in O
Nebraska B-LOC
, O
farmer O
Darrel B-PER
Armstrong I-PER
sees O
the O
issue O
as O
less O
about O
Nebraska B-LOC
versus O
Colorado B-LOC
and O
more O
a O
battle O
of O
“ O
agriculture O
against O
urban O
.” O

We O
feel O
that O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
agreements O
that O
have O
been O
made O
that O
[rural O
areas O
are] O
coming O
up O
short,” O
Armstrong B-PER
said O
to O
CNN B-ORG
. O

The O
people O
who O
are O
upholding O
the O
agreements O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
making O
the O
agreements O
. O

According O
to O
Cech B-PER
, O
the O
population O
expansion O
in O
the O
High B-LOC
Plains I-LOC
was O
enabled O
by O
the O
agriculture O
industry O
. O

If O
you O
don’t O
have O
irrigation O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
– O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
– O
all O
you’re O
going O
to O
grow O
is O
probably O
prickly O
pear O
cactus O
and O
sagebrush O
,” O
Cech B-PER
said O
. O

Water O
is O
key O
to O
that O
economic O
growth O
, O
not O
only O
in O
Colorado B-LOC
or O
Western B-LOC
Nebraska I-LOC
, O
but O
in O
California B-LOC
and O
the O
West B-LOC
in O
general O
. O

As O
the O
drought O
lingers O
, O
which O
Armstrong B-PER
called O
, O
“ O
very O
devastating O
, O
” O
the O
tougher O
the O
conditions O
for O
his O
business O
. O

We O
are O
looking O
at O
potentially O
zero O
production O
on O
our O
dry O
land O
crops O
without O
water O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

He O
agrees O
with O
Goddard B-PER
that O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
needs O
to O
be O
protected O

The O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
basically O
is O
the O
lifeblood O
to O
our O
surface O
aquifer O
and O
so O
we O
need O
to O
somehow O
keep O
the O
South B-LOC
Platte I-LOC
running O
Armstrong B-PER
said O

We’re O
seeing O
less O
and O
less O
come O
down O
the O
river O
from O
what O
we O
had O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Lawsuits O
could O
delay O
Nebraska B-LOC
from O
moving O
forward O
with O
its O
canal O
project O

But O
for O
now O
, O
on O
these O
farms O
and O
ranches O
, O
there O
are O
more O
questions O
than O
answers O
. O

What O
can O
they O
do O
for O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
it’s O
not O
disrupting O
my O
production O
, O
but O
also O
my O
other O
producers O
in O
this O
area O
? O

rancher O
Goddard O
wondered O

It’s O
just O
beginning O
of O
a O
new O
era O
of O
water O
wars O
in O
an O
age O
of O
unprecedented O
climate O
change O
as O
rivers O
dry O
up O
and O
desperation O
flows O
. O

Human O
nature O
is O
our O
biggest O
barrier O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
in O
trying O
to O
manage O
water O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
Cech B-PER
said O
. O

It O
manages O
to O
both O
shock O
and O
seem O
entirely O
, O
chillingly O
, O
predictable O
. O

The O
killings O
of O
key O
terrorist O
leaders O
have O
become O
increasingly O
commonplace O
, O
as O
the O
attacks O
they O
used O
to O
plot O
or O
inspire O
dwindle O
in O
their O
impact O
on O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
West’s B-LOC
counter-terrorism O
capability O
grows O
. O

But O
taking O
out O
the O
head O
of O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
, O
Ayman B-PER
al-Zawahiri I-PER
, O
on O
a O
balcony O
in O
one O
of O
the O
fanciest O
neighborhoods O
in O
Kabul B-LOC
– O
a O
city O
from O
which O
the O
US O
withdrew O
in O
chaos O
a O
year O
ago O
– O
is O
no O
everyday O
feat O
. O

It O
is O
a O
shocking O
display O
of O
what O
twenty O
years’ O
experience O
hunting O
terrorists O
has O
left O
the O
US B-ORG
capable O
of O

Yet O
it O
leaves O
a O
predictable O
lesson O
in O
its O
wake O
: O
Afghanistan B-LOC
has O
remained O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
terrorists O
over O
the O
past O
decade O
– O
they O
just O
didn’t O
carry O
out O
attacks O
from O
there O
that O
meant O
we O
paid O
attention O
. O

But O
the O
fact O
that O
Zawahiri B-PER
lived O
there O
in O
plain O
sight O
debunks O
the O
febrile O
spinning O
that O
went O
on O
in O
the O
lead-up O
to O
the O
US B-ORG
withdrawal O

For O
years O
, O
the O
US’s B-ORG
perception O
of O
the O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
threat O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
appeared O
to O
vacillate O
depending O
on O
what O
footprint O
the O
US B-ORG
was O
pursuing O
; O
in O
years O
when O
they O
wanted O
to O
push O
harder O
during O
their O
longest O
war O
, O
I O
recall O
being O
briefed O
that O
a O
solid O
hardcore O
threat O
– O
perhaps O
a O
few O
hundred O
key O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
figures O
– O
remained O
and O
could O
reconstitute O
itself O
. O

Then O
, O
as O
the O
US B-ORG
rushed O
for O
the O
exits O
, O
the O
danger O
posed O
by O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
was O
played O
down O
. O

Afghan B-LOC
raids O
against O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
leaders O
showed O
how O
well O
the O
problem O
was O
being O
handled O
, O
the O
US B-ORG
seemed O
to O
imply O
, O
rather O
than O
that O
the O
group O
was O
still O
there O
and O
big O
enough O
to O
hit O
. O

Now O
– O
ironically O
because O
of O
this O
American B-LOC
success O
– O
there O
is O
undeniable O
evidence O
of O
the O
problem O
Washington B-LOC
has O
wished O
away O
for O
years O

Al B-ORG

are O
“cooking O
something O
up,” O
said O
one O
former O
Afghan B-LOC
government O
official O
with O
an O
intimate O
grasp O
of O
counter-terrorism O
. O

He O
suggested O
that O

not O
the O
only O
major O
al O

figure O
in O
the O

by O
the O
UN B-ORG
to O
be O
in O
Iran B-LOC
– O
may O
have O
entered O
Afghanistan B-LOC
recently O
. O

In O
May O
last O
year O
, O
shortly O
before O
the O
startling O
fall O
of O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
it O
was O
estimated O
by O
Afghan B-LOC
intelligence O
officials O
that O
it O
would O
take O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
between O
six O
and O
12 O
months O
to O
carry O
out O
attacks O
in O
the O
region O
, O
and O
perhaps O
18 O
months O
to O
do O
the O
same O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
. O

It’s O
unclear O
how O
that O
timeline O
has O
been O
affected O
by O
Zawahiri’s B-PER
death O
, O
but O
we O
can O
be O
sure O
its O
symbolic O
impact O
means O
it O
is O
unlikely O
to O
have O
sped O
it O
up O
. O

So O
where O
does O
this O
leave O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
? O

In O
truth O
, O
not O
much O
has O
changed O
. O

The O
Haqqani B-ORG
network I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
a O
tight O
hold O
on O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
has O
long O
been O
accused O
of O
strong O
links O
to O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
. O

It O
may O
well O
be O
their O
infrastructure O
which O
hid O
and O
supported O
Zawahiri B-PER
during O
his O
time O
in O
the O
city O
. O

His O
death O
may O
therefore O
accentuate O
any O
splits O
within O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
; O
the O
group’s O
moderates O
may O
wish O
its O
efforts O
to O
acclimatize O
to O
the O
world O
stage O
had O
not O
been O
hampered O
by O
this O
incident O

But O
don’t O
count O
too O
hard O
on O
that O

The O
Haqqanis B-ORG
remain O
perhaps O
the O
most O
confident O
and O
assertive O
wing O
of O
the O
group O
, O
and O
it O
is O
unlikely O
they’ll O
suddenly O
change O
tack O
after O
this O
embarrassment O
. O

For O
the O
ordinary O
people O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
grappling O
with O
the O
impact O
of O
sanctions O
, O
isolation O
and O
the O
struggle O
an O
insurgency O
was O
always O
going O
to O
face O
when O
it O
suddenly O
had O
to O
provide O
government O
services O
, O
it O
is O
yet O
more O
bad O
news O
. O

It O
is O
harder O
to O
make O
a O
case O
for O
improving O
the O
West’s B-LOC
relationship O
with O
Kabul B-LOC
after O
this O

And O
it O
is O
not O
as O
if O
this O
strike O
enormously O
alters O
the O
reality O
that O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
face O
on O
the O
ground O
: O
Their O
brand O
has O
spun O
into O
a O
series O
of O
global O
franchises O
that O
inflict O
local O
terror O
– O
usually O
by O
locals O
on O
locals O
. O

Yet O
they O
remain O
a O
group O
that O
has O
not O
brutalized O
its O
way O
into O
world O
headlines O
for O
some O
time O

Zawahiri B-PER
seems O
, O
according O
to O
one O
senior O
counter-terrorism O
analyst O
, O
to O
have O
become O
more O
relaxed O
and O
confident O
in O
his O
messages O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
referring O
to O
more O
recent O
world O
events O
; O
complacency O
, O
either O
on O
his O
part O
or O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his O
hosts O
, O
may O
have O
led O
to O
this O
successful O
strike O
. O

Zawahiri B-PER
is O
still O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
directly O
involved O
in O
planning O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
operations O
, O
but O
the O
world O
has O
changed O
since O
the O
abrupt O
shock O
and O
seismic O
grief O
of O
September B-LOC
11 O
, O
2001 O
. O

His O
death O
is O
unlikely O
to O
halt O
any O
attacks O
that O
are O
already O
in O
the O
planning O

It O
does O
, O
though O
, O
teach O
us O
two O
lessons O
: O
Firstly O
, O
that O
despite O
its O
humiliating O
but O
strategically O
inevitable O
withdrawal O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
US B-ORG
retains O
a O
long O
reach O
and O
a O
long O
memory O
. O

It O
is O
still O
pursuing O
justice O
for O
a O
twenty-year-old O
crime O

There O
is O
a O
resolve O
here O
, O
and O
given O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration’s O
support O
for O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
that O
cannot O
go O
unnoticed O
by O
the O
US’s B-ORG
adversaries O
. O

But O
the O
second O
lesson O
is O
darker O
: O
That O
people O
don’t O
always O
change O
. O

That O
, O
even O
after O
the O
ravages O
of O
the O
NATO B-ORG
presence O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
damage O
and O
chaos O
brought O
to O
that O
country O
by O
the O
Taliban’s B-ORG
decision O
to O
allow O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
to O
shelter O
there O
decades O
ago O
, O
some O
part O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
chose O
to O
give O
them O
a O
home O
there O
again O
. O

The O
scene O
still O
baffles O
me O
: O
that O
in O
an O
area O
where O
for O
twenty O
years O
Westerners O
and O
connected O
Afghan B-LOC
officials O
would O
bask O
in O
comfort O
behind O
secure O
walls O
, O
a O
US B-ORG
drone O
strike O
killed O
the O
leader O
of O
al-Qaeda B-ORG
– O
who O
thought O
he O
could O
relax O
on O
a O
balcony O
in O
the O

In O
a O

many O
of O

on O
whether O
they O
actually O
believe O
he O
will O
face O
formal O
charges O
, O
sources O
said O
. O

Yet O
the O
former O

expressed O
a O
heavy O

of O
skepticism O
that O
he O
will O
be O
indicted O
, O
one O
of O
the O

Another O
source O
close O

the O
former O

told O

that O
Trump B-PER
also O
has O
posed O
questions O

some O

concerned O
about O
the O
possibility O
of O

But O
one O
person O
close O
to O
Trump B-PER
said O
he O
is O
noticeably O
more O
engaged O
when O
he O
is O
chatting O
with O
friends O
and O
advisers O
about O
the O
2022 O
midterms O
and O
his O
possible O
presidential O
campaign O
in O
2024 O
than O
he O
has O
been O
during O
briefings O
on O
legal O
strategy O

This O
person O
described O
the O
former O
President O
as O
dismissive O
in O
conversations O
about O
his O
legal O
troubles O
, O
often O
repeating O
his O
“witch O
hunt” O
mantra O
as O
he O
claims O
the O
various O
probes O
he’s O
facing O
are O
plainly O
driven O
by O
political O
opponents O
. O

A O
Trump B-ORG
spokesman O
said O
in O
a O
statement O
to O

: O
“ O

people O
familiar O

told O

Trump B-PER
has O
specifically O
been O
counseled O
to O
cut O
contact O
with O
his O
former O
White B-ORG

Mark B-PER
Meadows I-PER
, O
whose O
actions O
leading O
up O
to O
and O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
Capitol I-LOC
insurrection O
have O
been O
deeply O
scrutinized O
by O
the O

Two O
of O
Meadows’ O
former O
top O

, O
Cassidy B-PER
Hutchinson I-PER

Alyssa B-PER
Farah I-PER
Griffin I-PER

also O
have O

actions O
on O
January O

during O
her O
public O

the O
House B-ORG
panel O
in O
June O
. O

Hutchinson O
is O
cooperating O
in O
the O
DOJ O
probe O
as O
well O

Some O
of O
Trump’s B-ORG
attorneys O
believe O
Meadows B-PER
could O
also O
be O
in O
investigators’ O
crosshairs O
and O
are O
concerned O
he O
could O
become O
a O
fact O
witness O
if O
he O
is O
pushed O
to O
cooperate O
in O
the O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
probe O
, O
according O
to O
two O
people O
familiar O
with O
the O
matter O
. O

In O
response O
, O
Meadows’ O
attorney O
George B-PER
Terwilliger I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
on O
Thursday O
: O
“ O
All O
of O
that O
is O
idle O
and O
uninformed O
speculation O
, O
apparently O
by O
people O
that O
know O
little O
but O
talk O
a O
lot O
.” O

Former O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
attorney O
Ty B-PER
Cobb I-PER
said O
Meadows O
is O
“perfectly O
positioned O
to O
be O
the O
John B-PER
Dean I-PER
of O
this O
mess,” O
referring O
to O
the O
former O
Richard B-PER
Nixon I-PER
aide O
who O
offered O
crucial O
public O
testimony O
during O
the O
Watergate B-LOC
hearings. O

The O
reason O
[Meadows] O
is O
valuable O
is O
also O
the O
reason O
he O
is O
in O
jeopardy O
: O
He O
was O
basically O
at O
Trump’s B-PER
right O
hand O
throughout O
all O
these O
exercises O
and O
participated O
in O
key O
meetings O

Yet, O
according O
to O
a O
source O

the O

Trump B-PER

Meadows B-PER
have O
spoken O
a O
number O
of O
times. O

Another O
source O
close O

Trump B-PER
described O
their O
relationship O
as O
“not O
the O

it O
once O
was” O
while O
they O
served O
in O
the O

but O
insisted O
they O
still O
maintained O
a O

even O
as O
Trump B-PER

complained O
about O
Meadows B-PER
in O
his O
recent O
conversations O

By O
the O
end O
of O
the O

the O
fledgling O

was O
supported O
by O
only O
some O
2,500 O

a O

9,000 O

Why O
Biden B-PER
went O
through O
with O
the O
withdrawal O
plan O
that O
he O
had O
inherited O
from O
Trump B-PER
is O
still O
something O
of O
a O
puzzle O
since O
there O
was O
no O
large O
, O
vocal O
constituency O
in O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
that O
was O
demanding O
a O
total O
US B-LOC
pullout O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC

and O
Biden’s B-PER
top O
military O
advisers O
had O
clearly O
warned O
him O
of O
the O
risks O
of O
doing O
so O
. O

that O
unless O

around O

the O

The O
“Taliban O
2.0” O
delusion O
The O
publication O
of O
Haqqani’s O
op-ed O
in O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
was O
emblematic O
of O
the O
wishful O
thinking O
about O
the O
Taliban O
in O
the O
US O
that O
had O
persisted O
for O
years O

In O
this O
view O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
were O
just O
a O
bunch O
of O
misunderstood O
backwoodsmen O
who O
would O
eventually O
do O
what O
was O
only O
sensible O
: O
break O
with O
al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
and O
abandon O
much O
of O
their O
misogynistic O
ideology O
as O
a O
quid O
pro O
quo O
for O
their O
recognition O
on O
the O
world O
stage O
. O

This O
was O
a O
classic O
case O
of O
mirror O
imaging O
; O
the O
belief O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
would O
do O
the O
rational O
things O
some O
gullible O
Americans B-LOC
expected O
them O
to O
do O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
implementing O
the O
quasi-mediaeval O
ideology O
that O
has O
been O
at O
the O
core O
of O
their O
armed O
movement O
since O
they O
first O
emerged O
almost O
three O
decades O
ago O
. O

It O
was O
like O
imagining O
the O
Khmer B-ORG
Rouge I-ORG
would O
“mature” O
once O
they O
had O
taken O
power O
in O
Cambodia B-LOC
. O

A O
key O
proponent O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
Taliban O
would O
change O
if O
the O
right O
carrots O
were O
dangled O
in O
front O
of O
them O
was O
Barnett B-PER
Rubin I-PER
of O
NYU B-ORG
, O
an O
expert O
on O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
who O
claimed O
in O
a O
paper O
that O
he O
published O
with O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of O
Peace I-ORG
in O
March O
2021 O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
had O
“underestimated O
the O
leverage O
that O
the O
Taliban’s O
quest O
for O
sanctions O
relief O
, O
recognition O
and O
international O
assistance O
provides O
. O

Turns O
out O
that O
it O
was O
Rubin B-PER
who O
overestimated O
how O
much O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
cared O
about O
sanctions O
relief O
and O
international O
assistance O
, O
while O
he O
had O
also O
vastly O
underestimated O
their O
desire O
to O
banish O
women O
from O
jobs O
and O
education O
and O
maintain O
their O
warm O
relations O
with O
their O
old O
buddies O
in O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
. O

This O
shouldn’t O
have O
come O
as O
much O
of O
a O
surprise O
, O
since O
that O
was O
exactly O
how O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
had O
ruled O
the O
last O
time O
that O
they O
were O
in O
power O
in O
the O
years O
before O
9/11 O
. O

The O
Taliban B-ORG
hadn’t O
fought O
the O
US B-ORG
and O
Afghan B-LOC
militaries O
for O
two O
decades O
only O
to O
install O
a O
quasi-democracy O
when O
they O
came O
to O
power O
for O
the O
second O
time O

The O
“moderate” O
Taliban B-ORG
2.0 O
that O
was O
supposedly O
emerging O
in O
recent O
years O
was O
a O
profound O
delusion O
that O
gripped O
US B-ORG
policymakers O
. O

A O
month O
after O
Biden B-PER
had O
announced O
the O
impending O
withdrawal O
of O
all O
US O
troops O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
US O
negotiator O
with O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
, O
Khalilzad B-PER
, O
testified O
to O
the O
US O
House B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on O
May O
16 O
, O
2021 O
, O
that O
those O
who O
thought O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
would O
quickly O
take O
over O
the O
country O
as O
the O
US O
pulled O
out O
were O
“ O
mistaken O
.” O

Khalilzad B-PER
also O
asserted O
that O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
would O
opt O
for O
a O
political O
settlement O
over O
a O
military O
victory O
, O
testifying O
, O
“ O
They O
say O
they O
seek O
normalcy O
in O
terms O
of O
relations O
— O
acceptability O
, O
removal O
from O
sanctions O
, O
not O
to O
remain O
a O
pariah O
.” O

Just O
months O
later O
the O
distinctive O
white O
flags O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
were O
fluttering O
over O
the O
capital O
, O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
began O
implementing O
their O
theocratic O
state O
. O

In O
a O
symbolic O
move O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
’s O
feared O
religious O
police O
soon O
commandeered O
what O
had O
formerly O
been O
the O
ministry O
for O
women’s O
affairs O
. O

Obviously, O
that O
ministry O
would O
no O
longer O
be O
needed, O
but O
the O
“Vice B-ORG
and I-ORG
Virtue” I-ORG
police O
would O
have O
to O
be O
properly O
accommodated. O

The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
released O
a O
report O
in O
May O
in O
which O
it O
observed O
that O
an O
astonishing O
41 O
members O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
serving O
in O
the O
cabinet O
or O
other O
senior-level O
government O
positions O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
are O
on O
UN B-ORG
sanctions O
lists O
. O

Taliban O
2.0 O
was O
a O
mirage O
, O
and O
the O
Taliban O
today O
is O
Taliban O
1.0 O
with O
one O
major O
difference O
; O
they O
are O
far O
better O
armed O
than O
the O
Taliban O
that O
ruled O
over O
most O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
1996 O
to O
2001 O
. O

Now O
they O
ride O
into O
battle O
with O
American B-LOC
armored O
vehicles O
and O
M-16 O
rifles O
that O
were O
left O
behind O
as O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
rushed O
for O
the O
exits O
last O
summer O

The O
Taliban B-ORG
today O
also O
face O
a O
far O
weaker O
opposition O
movement O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
than O
was O
the O
case O
for O
the O
pre-9/11 O
Taliban B-ORG
. O

Signaling O
weakness O
to O
Russia B-LOC
and O
China B-LOC
When O
Biden B-PER
spoke O
to O
the O
American B-LOC
people O
on O
Aug. O
31 O
, O
2021 O
, O
as O
the O
last O
US O
soldiers O
departed O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
he O
framed O
the O
withdrawal O
as O
a O
way O
of O
positioning O
the O
US O
to O
compete O
better O
against O
great-power O
rivals O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
We’re O
engaged O
in O
a O
serious O
competition O
with O
China B-LOC
. O
” O

We’re O
dealing O
with O
the O
challenges O
on O
multiple O
fronts O
with O
Russia B-LOC
…And O
there’s O
nothing O
China B-LOC
or O
Russia I-LOC
would O
rather O
have O
, O
would O
want O
more O
in O
this O
competition O
than O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
to O
be O
bogged O
down O
another O
decade O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

This O
was O
an O
absurd O
rationale O
: O
For O
years O
both O
China B-LOC
and O
Russia B-LOC
had O
hoped O
to O
push O
American O
forces O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
because O
the O
country O
borders O
both O
China B-LOC
and O
the O
republics O
of O
the O
former O
Soviet B-LOC
Union I-LOC
. O

Russia B-LOC
had O
covertly O
supported O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
, O
according O
to O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
, O
while O
the O
Chinese O
had O
drawn O
closer O
to O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
in O
recent O
years O
. O

As O
they O
pulled O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Americans O
abandoned O
the O
vast O
Bagram B-LOC
Air I-LOC
Base I-LOC
which O
could O
house O
up O
to O
10,000 O
troops O
; O
a O
more O
ideal O
site O
from O
which O
to O
engage O
in O
competition O
with O
either O
China B-LOC
or O
Russia B-LOC
is O
hard O
to O
imagine O
. O

You O
could O
practically O
hear O
the O
high O
fives O
in O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
as O
the O
US O
ignominiously O
retreated O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
herald O
an O
era O
of O
the O
US O
pulling O
back O
from O
the O
world O
. O

It O
hardly O
seems O
accidental O
that O
three O
months O
later O
Russian O
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
moved O
an O
army O
to O
the O
border O
with O
Ukraine B-LOC
as O
a O
prelude O
to O
his O
invasion O
of O
the O
country O
. O

A O
predictable O
fiasco O
In O
June O
2021 O
, O
I O
wrote O
for O
CNN B-ORG
, O
“ O
We O
could O
see O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
a O
remix O
of O
the O
disastrous O
US O
pullout O
from O
Saigon B-LOC
in O
1975 O
and O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
in O
Iraq B-LOC
when O
ISIS B-ORG
took O
over O
much O
of O
the O
country O
following O
the O
US O
pullout O
from O
the O
country O

That O
prediction O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
proved O
to O
be O
accurate O
; O
the O
American B-LOC
pullout O
from O
Saigon B-LOC
looked O
like O
a O
dignified O
retreat O
compared O
to O
the O
scenes O
of O
thousands O
of O
desperate O
Afghans B-LOC
trying O
to O
get O
on O
planes O
leaving O
Kabul B-LOC
airport O
last O
August O
. O

Some O
Afghans O
were O
so O
desperate O
to O
leave O
that O
they O
clung O
to O
the O
fuselage O
of O
a O
plane O
that O
was O
taking O
off O

and O
two O
plunged O
to O
their O
deaths O

On O
Aug. O
25 O
, O
2021 O
, O
13 O
US O
soldiers O
and O
at O
least O
170 O
Afghans O
were O
killed O
at O
the O
airport O
by O
a O
suicide O
bomber O
dispatched O
by O
the O
Afghan O
branch O
of O
ISIS B-ORG

And O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
took O
over O
the O
entire O
country O
even O
before O
the O
last O
US O
soldiers O
had O
left O
Afghanistan B-LOC

Compounding O
Biden’s B-PER
disastrous O
policy O
decision O
to O
completely O
pull O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
was O
the O
botched O
handling O
of O
the O
withdrawal O

According O
to O
a O
report O
about O
that O
withdrawal O
released O
in O
February B-LOC
by O
Republican O
senators O
sitting O
on O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Relations I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
, O
the O
first O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
meeting O
to O
discuss O
evacuating O
Americans O
and O
Afghans O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
took O
place O
on O
Aug. O
14 O
, O
only O
one O
day O
before O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
seized O
Kabul B-LOC
and O
five O
months O
after O
Biden B-PER
had O
first O
publicly O
announced O
the O
total O
US O
withdrawal O
from O
the O
country O
. O

Biden B-PER
patted O
himself O
on O
the O
back O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
subsequently O
extracted O
124,000 O
Afghans O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
calling O
the O
operation O
an O
“extraordinary O
success,” O
which O
was O
like O
an O
arsonist O
praising O
himself O
for O
helping O
to O
try O
to O
put O
out O
a O
fire O
that O
he O
had O

But O
even O
accepting O
the O
most O
self-congratulatory O
view O
of O
the O
Biden B-PER

handling O
of O
the O

Allies I-ORG
, O
an O
advocacy O
group O
for O
Afghans O
who O
had O
worked O
for O
the O
US O
, O
estimated O
in O
March O
that O
only O
about O
3% O
of O
the O
81,000 O
Afghans O
who O
had O
worked O
for O
the O
US O
government O
and O
had O
applied O
for O
special O
visas O
had O
made O
it O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
leaving O
78,000 O
behind O
. O

Four O
months O
after O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
took O
over O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
convened O
the O
“Summit O
for O
Democracy” O
in O
Washington B-LOC
consisting O
of O
the O
world’s O
democracies O
. O

Five O
months O
earlier O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
have O
warranted O
an O
invitation O
to O
this O
summit O
, O
but O
Biden B-PER
had O
enabled O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
to O
take O
over O
the O
country O
, O
which O
ended O
almost O
every O
shred O
of O
a O
liberal O
democracy O
that O
had O
once O
existed O
there O
. O

Following O
the O
Afghan B-LOC
debacle O
, O
Biden’s B-PER
favorable O
ratings O
dropped O
to O
the O
lowest O
level O
of O
his O
presidency O
to O
that O
point O
to O
46 O
. O

They O
have O
never O
recovered O

The O
Biden B-PER
administration O
now O
faces O
a O
policy O
dilemma O
of O
its O
own O
making O
. O

Since O
so O
many O
millions O
of O
Afghans O
are O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
starvation O
, O
Biden B-PER
officials O
cannot O
completely O
turn O
their O
backs O
on O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O

And O
yet O
it’s O
hard O
to O
help O
Afghans B-LOC
without O
propping O
up O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
in O
some O
manner O
. O

The O
Biden B-PER
administration O
has O
tried O
to O
ensure O
that O
all O
US O
aid O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
is O
administered O
in O
a O
way O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
end O
up O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
, O
but O
realistically O
any O
help O
that O
the O
US O
sends O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
tends O
to O
help O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
remain O
in O
power O
. O

This O
is O
surely O
one O
of O
the O
most O
spectacular O
own O
goals O
the O
US B-LOC
has O
ever O
scored O

House O
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi I-PER

Thursday O
that O
a O

the O
Korean B-LOC
Demilitarized I-LOC

Pelosi B-PER
said O
the O

also O
visited O
Seoul B-LOC

described O
as O
“ O
a O

at O
a O
parliamentary O

Providing O
a O

The O
announcement O

after O

recently O
visited O
Taiwan B-LOC
amid O
threats O
of O

Pelosi B-PER
landed O

After O
the O
Federal B-ORG

July O
meeting O
, O
investors O
quickly O
reached O
a O
consensus O
: O
The O
central O
bank O
was O
turning O
slightly O
dovish O
. O

After O
embarking O
on O
an O
aggressive O
rate-hike O
spree O
this O
year O
in O
a O
bid O
to O
fight O
inflation O
, O
the O
Fed B-ORG
indicated O
it O
could O
downgrade O
the O
size O
of O
its O
hikes O
moving O
forward O
. O

We’ve O
been O
front-end O
loading O
these O
very O
large O
rate O
increases O
, O
and O
now O
we’re O
getting O
closer O
to O
where O
we O
need O
to O
be O
, O
” O
Fed B-ORG
Chair O
Jerome B-PER
Powell I-PER
told O
reporters O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Powell O
said O
, O
another O
“ O
unusually O
large O
” O
increase O
could O
be O
on O
the O
table O
too O
. O

But O
Wall B-LOC

looked O
past O
that O

What O
came O
next O
: O
Investors O
cheered O
Powell’s O
apparent O
pivot O
. O

The O
S&P O
500 O
rallied O
, O
notching O
its O
best O
month O
since O
November B-LOC
2020 O
, O
and O
financial O
conditions O
eased O
. O

Mortgage O
rates O
fell O
below O
5% O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
mid-April O

Now, O
Fed O
officials O
are O
trying O
to O
set O
the O
record O
straight. O

Not O
wanting O
markets O
to O
change O
course O
too O
sharply O
, O
reversing O
the O
effects O
of O
their O
hard O
work O
thus O
far O

“ O

We’re] O
nowhere O
near O
almost O
done,” O
San B-LOC
Francisco I-LOC
Fed O
President O
Mary B-PER

said O
in O
an O

last O

Loretta B-PER
Mester I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG

Bank I-ORG
of O
Cleveland B-LOC

told O
the O
Washington B-LOC
Post I-ORG
that O
it O
“ O
would O
be O
inappropriate O
… O
to O
cry O
victory O
too O
early O
” O
and O
risk O
letting O
high O
inflation O
become O
entrenched O
. O

We O
need O
to O
see O
really O
compelling O
evidence O
that O
inflation O
is O
moving O
down O
, O
and O
my O
view O
is O
that O
we O
haven’t O
seen O
that O
yet O
, O
Mester B-PER
said O
. O

As O
the O
Fed B-ORG
tries O
to O
bring O
demand O
back O
down O
so O
it O
stops O
running O
up O
against O
limited O
supply O
— O
pushing O
up O
prices O
— O
it’s O
closely O
watching O
the O
labor O
market O
, O
which O
has O
remained O
strong O
. O

While O
job O
openings O
fell O
in O
June B-LOC
, O
the O
US B-LOC
economy O
continues O
to O
add O
jobs O
at O
a O
healthy O
pace O
. O

A O
blowout O
July O
report O
released O
Friday O
showed O
a O

of O
528,000 O
positions O
last O
month O

The O
unemployment O
rate O
ticked O
down O
to O
3.5% O
. O

The O
news O
poured O
cold O
water O
on O
the O
theory O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
would O
change O
its O
approach O
dramatically O
any O
time O
soon O

The O
central O
bank O
actually O
wants O
to O
see O
some O
weakening O
in O
the O
job O
market O
. O

When O
there O
are O
too O
many O
open O
roles O
, O
wages O
rise O
quickly O
, O
which O
can O
make O
economy-wide O
inflation O
even O
worse O
. O

This O
isn’t O
the O
news O
the O
Fed O
wanted O
to O
hear O
, O
and O
this O
will O
likely O
cause O
it O
to O
push O
rates O
higher O
, O
faster O

down O
slightly O

America’s B-LOC
strong O

is O
hurting O
everyone O

The O
US B-LOC

has O
been O
on O
a O
tear O
this O

That’s O
good O
news O
for O
American B-LOC

but O
bad O
news O
for O
pretty O
much O
every O
other O
country O
in O
the O
world O
. O

The O
latest: O
The O
greenback O
is O
up O
more O
than O
10% O
in O
2022 O
compared O
to O
other O
top O
currencies O
— O
near O
its O
highest O
level O
in O
two O
decades O
— O
as O
investors O
worried O
about O
a O
global O
recession O
have O
rushed O
to O
scoop O
up O
dollars, O
which O
are O
considered O
a O
safe O
haven O
in O
turbulent O

Adding O
to O
the O

appeal O
is O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve’s I-ORG
aggressive O
campaign O
of O
interest O
rate O
hikes O
to O
tackle O
decades-high O
inflation O

That’s O
made O

more O
attractive O

it’s O
a O

picture O

The O

some O

A O

Taiwan B-LOC
that O
Beijing B-LOC
says O
it O

usually O

After O
China B-LOC
sent O
ballistic O
missiles O
over O
the O

Thursday O
, O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
President O
Tsai B-PER
Ing-wen I-PER
vowed O
to O
“firmly O
defend O
our O

and O
national O
security O
, O
and O
stick O
to O
the O
line O
of O
defense O
of O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
. O

Those O
missiles O
got O
the O
attention O
of O
Japan B-LOC
, O
too O
. O

Five O
of O
them O
landed O
inside O
Japan’s B-LOC
Exclusive O
Economic O
Zone O
, O
an O
area O
of O
the O
ocean O
where O
a O
country O
enjoys O
special O

like O
fishing O
and O
mining O
under O
the O

. O

Japanese O
Prime O
Minister O
Fumio B-PER
Kishida I-PER
said O
the O
Chinese O
drills O
were O
“ O
a O
serious O
issue O
concerning O
the O
security O
of O
our O
country O
and O
its O
people O
.” O

He O
called O
for O
an O
immediate O
halt O
to O
them O
and O
said O
Japan B-LOC
would O
work O
with O
its O
closest O
ally O
, O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
, O
“ O
to O
maintain O
stability O
in O

Meanwhile O
, O
US O

Antony B-PER
Blinken I-PER
, O
speaking O
at O
the O
ASEAN-US B-ORG
Ministerial I-ORG
meeting O
in O
Cambodia B-LOC
, O
said O
, O
“ O
I O
hope O
very O
much O
that O
Beijing B-LOC
will O
not O
manufacture O
a O
crisis O
or O
seek O
a O
pretense O
to O
increase O
its O
aggressive O
military O
action O
. O
” O

But O
in O
Washington B-LOC
, O
the O
official O
line O
was O
that O
Beijing’s B-LOC
actions O
came O
as O
no O
surprise O
. O

We O
anticipated O
that O
China B-LOC
might O
take O
steps O
like O
this O
– O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
described O
them O
for O
you O

, O
told O

at O
the O

. O

We O
also O
expect O
that O
these O
actions O
will O
continue O
and O
that O
the O
Chinese O
will O
continue O
to O
react O
in O
the O
coming O

Isolating O
Taiwan B-LOC
Visiting O
with O
Kishida B-PER
on O
Friday O
, O
Pelosi B-PER
said O
Beijing B-LOC
was O
trying O
to O
“isolate” O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O

China’s B-LOC
exercises O
were O
designed O
to O
practice O
doing O
exactly O
that O
, O
said O
Carl B-PER
Schuster I-PER
, O
a O
former O

at O
the O
US B-ORG
Pacific I-ORG

China B-LOC
(is O
showing) O
it O
can O
bombard O
Taiwan B-LOC
with O

and O
isolate O
it O

outside O
support O

affect O
air O
and O
maritime O
trade O
through O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC

around O
Taiwan,” B-LOC
Schuster B-PER
said. O

That’s O
long O
been O
Beijing’s B-LOC
plan O
, O
and O
this O
week’s O
exercises O
are O
just O
the O
manifestation O
of O
at O
least O
months O
of O
planning O
and O
years O
of O
policy O
, O
the O
experts O
said O
. O

An O
exercise O
of O
this O
size O
, O
scope O
and O
complexity O
cannot O
be O
planned O
and O
the O
forces O
prepared O
in O
two O
weeks O
, O
” O
Schuster B-PER
said O
, O
referring O
to O
the O
period O
following O
rumors O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
trip O
to O
the O
island O
. O

He O
said O
the O
outlines O
of O
the O
Chinese O
military O
exercises O
were O
likely O
decided O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
most O
of O
the O
actions O
set O
by O
April O

Parts O
of O
the O
drills O
, O
like O
the O
multiple O
ballistic O
missile O
launches O
, O
could O
have O
been O
added O
in O
the O
past O
few O
weeks O
as O
the O
logistics O
of O
those O
are O
not O
as O
complicated O
as O
say O
, O
setting O
up O
a O
naval O
blockade O
, O
which O
Beijing B-LOC
said O
was O
one O
of O
its O
practice O
points O
for O
the O
exercises O
. O

Drills O
‘to O
intimidate O
the O
US B-LOC
and O
Japan’ B-LOC
Schuster B-PER
also O
noted O
that O
the O
exercises O
are O
larger O
than O
those O
China B-LOC
has O
organized O
in O
previous O
years. O

This O
expanded O
exercise O
activity O
has O
a O
third O
purpose O
– O
to O
intimidate O
the O
US B-LOC
and O
Japan B-LOC
– O
both O
of O
which O
have O
indicated O
their O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC
,” O
Schuster B-PER
said O
. O

If O
you O
look O
at O
the O
rhetoric O
from O
January O
to O
April O
, O
( O
Chinese O
President O
Xi O
Jinping B-PER
) O
and O
company O
were O
ramping O
up O
criticism O
of O
the O
US B-ORG

Japan B-LOC
, O
the O
latter O
over O
recent O
statements O
of O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC

its O

out O
Beijing B-LOC

China B-LOC

it O
says O

Furthermore O
, O
China B-LOC

made O
clear O
that O
it O

not O

In O

the O
late O

an O

to O
Japan B-LOC

People O
in O

Perhaps O

A O
portion O

the O
25th O

which O
addresses O
presidential O

allows O
a O

president O

a O
majority O
of O
the O
Cabinet O
to O
vote O
to O
remove O
a O

due O
to O
his O
inability O

“discharge O
the O

Pompeo B-PER

Lofgren B-PER

Partition O
is O
a O
track O
from O
the O
singer’s O
2013 O
self-titled O

In O
the O

, O
Beyoncé B-PER
sings O
that O
a O
man O
“ O
Monica B-PER
Lewinsky’d I-PER

The O
affair O
between O
Clinton B-PER
and O
then-22-year-old O
Lewinsky B-PER
ultimately O
led O
to O
Clinton’s B-PER
impeachment O
in O
1998 O

much O
discussion O
about O
consent O

abuse O
of O
power O

In O
2021 O

Lewinsky O
told O

Jake B-PER
Tapper I-PER
that O
“ O
what’s O
really O
important O
to O
remember O
in O
today’s O

is O
that O
we O
never O
should O
have O
even O
gotten O
to O
a O
place O
where O
consent O
was O
a O

So O
it O
was O
wholly O
inappropriate O
as O
the O
most O
powerful O
man O

my O

I O
was O

And O
I O
think O
that O
the O
power O
differentials O
there O
are O
something O
that O
I O
couldn’t O
ever O
fathom O
consequences O
at O
22 O
that O
I O
understand O
obviously O
so O
differently O

China B-LOC

previously O

a O
democratic O
island O

with O

We O
anticipated O
that O

take O
steps O

We O

expect O
that O
these O

that O
the O
Chinese O

continue O

react O
in O

Kirby B-PER

On O
Friday O

the O

“ O
a O

and O
called O

an O

Japan B-LOC

the O
US B-LOC

“work O

Speaking O

not O

” O
she O

in O

I O
think O
that O
what’s O

that O
there’s O
been O
a O
kind O

negativity O

that O

takes O
a O
slightly O
different O
approach O
. O

Berman B-PER
finds O
the O
love O
languages O
to O
be O
a O
helpful O
jumping-off O
point O
to O
educate O
her O
clients O

The O
love O
languages O
allow O
people O
to O
realize O
, O
she O
suggested O
, O
that O
love O
on O
its O
own O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

It O
needs O
to O
be O
acted O
upon O
in O
a O
way O
that O
makes O
a O
partner O
feel O
loved O
and O
seen O

“What O
I O
like O
about O
the O
love O
languages O
is O
that O
they O
are O
great O
prompts O
to O
talk O
about O
with O
your O
partner,” O
Gandhi B-PER
added. O

We O
tend O
to O
understand O
our O
own O
love O
languages O

But O
in O
my O
work O
and O
my O
own O
relationship O
, O
people O
often O
don’t O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
do O
the O
same O
for O
their O
partner O
. O

Gandhi O
and O
Berman O
agreed O
that O
love O
languages O
are O
helpful O
because O
they O
allow O
an O
individual O
or O
couple O
to O
gauge O
where O
they O
stand O
in O
a O
relationship O
. O

I O
encourage O
my O
clients O
to O
ask O
themselves O
whether O
they O
are O
doing O
a O
pretty O
good O
job O
across O
all O
five O
languages O
, O
” O
Gandhi B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
even O
if O
one O
or O
two O
of O
them O
are O
favored O
by O
your O
partner O
. O

Is O
it O
important O
that O
couples O
have O
the O
same O
love O
language O
? O

No O
, O
not O
at O
all O
. O

Love O
languages O
are O
as O
varied O
as O
can O
be,” O
Berman B-PER
said O
via O
email. O

She O
indicated O
there O
are O
actually O
many O
more O
than O
the O
traditional O
five O
languages O

She O
said O
she O
feels O
finding O
a O
partner O
with O
the O
exact O
same O
language O
could O
be O
impossible O
, O
but O
more O
importantly O
, O
love O
languages O
aren’t O
about O
people O
learning O
to O
love O
the O
exact O
same O
way O
as O
their O
partners O
. O

Rather, O
the O
theory O
of O
love O
languages O
is O
about O
learning O
that O
we O
all O
experience O
reality O
differently O
and O
have O
unique O
and O
sometimes O
mysterious O
internal O
lives. O

The O
way O
to O
achieve O
longevity O
and O
satisfaction O
is O
not O
by O
speaking O
the O
same O
love O
language O
as O
your O
partner O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
, O
but O
honoring O
that O
your O
partner O
may O
experience O
the O
world O
differently O
than O
you O
and O
making O
a O
commitment O
to O
seek O
out O
ways O
to O
make O
your O
partner O
feel O
loved O
. O

It’s O
about O
bringing O
the O
energy O
you O
want O
to O
experience O
into O
your O
relationship O
, O
rather O
than O
waiting O
for O
a O
happy O
ending O
to O
be O
handed O
to O
you O
, O
she O
said O
. O

Is O
it O
important O
to O
know O
and O
respond O
to O
your O
partner’s O
love O
language O
? O

Gandhi O
agreed O
that O
it’s O
important O
to O
respond O
to O
a O
partner’s O
preferred O
love O
language O
but O
also O
to O
recognize O
there O
isn’t O
just O
one O
playbook O

One O
day O
, O
your O
partner O
might O
need O
quality O
time O
from O
you O
. O

But O
on O
their O
birthday O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
they O
might O
want O
a O
gift O
. O

They O
may O
need O
physical O
affection O
on O
another O
day O

And O
along O
with O
the O
five O
love O
languages O
, O
other O
needs O
may O
arise O
in O
relationships O
, O
including O
good O
listening O
skills O
or O
knowing O
when O
to O
provide O
your O
partner O
some O
space O
, O
either O
physically O
or O
emotionally O
. O

Instead O
of O
following O
a O
love O
language O
playbook O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O
, O
partners O
need O
to O
be O
curious O
about O
how O
to O
satisfy O
one O
another O
. O

Vulnerability O
is O
a O
necessity O
, O
so O
focus O
on O
learning O
what O
barriers O
you O
may O
have O
erected O
to O
prevent O
you O
from O
being O
seen O
or O
heard O
. O

Can O
it O
be O
problematic O
not O
to O
know O
your O
partner’s O
love O
language O
? O

It’s O
problematic O
to O
have O
a O
relationship O
that O
isn’t O
built O
on O
communication O
, O
consistency O
and O
shared O
intentions O
to O
protect O
and O
nourish O
your O
bonds O
, O
Berman B-PER
said O

Love O
languages O
are O
just O
one O
resource O
you O
can O
use O
to O
help O
deepen O
your O
bond O
, O
but O
for O
many O
people O
, O
they O
just O
take O
the O
online O
love O
language O
quiz O
and O
sort O
of O
forget O
about O
it O
shortly O
thereafter O

If O
you O
actually O
use O
the O
information O
to O
actively O
make O
choices O
to O
celebrate O
your O
love O
and O
nourish O
your O
relationship O
, O
then O
it O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O
, O
” O
she O
said O
via O
email O
. O

Gandhi O
agreed O
but O
placed O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
utility O
of O
discussing O
the O
five O
languages O

She O
suggested O
couples O
talk O
about O
the O
five O
languages O
and O
understand O
what O
each O
partner O
feels O
like O
is O
their O
most O
consistently O
important O
one O
or O
maybe O
two O

A O
discussion O
might O
start O
with O
, O
“ O
Hey O
, O
I O
know O
quality O
time O
is O
really O
important O
to O
you O
. O
” O

Do O
you O
feel O
like O
we’ve O
shared O
enough O
quality O
time O
together O
? O

Overall O
it’s O
helpful O
for O
couples O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
love O
languages O
and O
make O
sure O
they’re O
happy O
with O
the O
love O
they’re O
receiving O

And O
to O
maximize O
satisfaction O
and O
longevity O
, O
open O
communication O
around O
relationship O
needs O
is O
critical O
. O

After O
all O
, O
as O
I O
know O
from O
my O
own O
practice O
, O
couples O
want O
their O
partner O
to O
feel O
loved O
the O
way O
they O
want O
to O
be O
loved O
. O

Talking O
through O
the O
love O
languages O
may O
not O
be O
the O
sole O
answer O
, O
but O
it’s O

And O
this O

provided O
crucial O
tests O
of O
his O
influence O

down O
to O
Kansas B-LOC

across O
to O

up O
to O

It O
is O
with O
Trump’s B-PER
strength O
within O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
that O
we O
begin O
our O
weekly O
journey O
into O
the O
numbers O

Trump B-PER
is O
still O
strong O
among O
Republicans O
Political O
analysts O
have O
long O
wondered O
when O
, O
or O
if O
, O
Trump’s B-PER
grip O
on O
the O
Republican O
electorate O
is O
going O
to O
cease O
. O

There O
have O
been O
plenty O
of O
articles O
written O
about O
how O
his O
influence O
may O
very O
well O
be O
on O
the O
decline O

This O
past O
week O
, O
however O
, O
offered O
proof O
that O
Trump B-PER
remains O
a O
power O
center O
within O
the O
party O
. O

It O
fits O
with O
other O
data O
suggesting O
that O
while O
the O
former O
President O
may O
not O
be O
as O
powerful O
as O
he O
once O
was O
, O
he O
remains O
a O
force O
to O
be O
reckoned O
with O
in O
the O
GOP B-ORG

Trump-backed O
candidates O
swept O
important O
statewide O
primaries O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
including O
for O
governor O
( O
where O
Trump’s O
candidate O
defeated O
the O
one O
endorsed O
by O
former O
Vice O
President O
Mike B-PER
Pence I-PER
) O
, O
US O
Senate B-ORG
, O
state O
attorney O
general O
and O
secretary O
of O
state O
. O

All O
of O
them O
deny O
the O
fact O
that O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
legitimately O
won O
the O
2020 O
presidential O
election O
. O

Likewise O
, O
in O
Michigan B-LOC
, O
Trump-endorsed O
Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
won O
the O
Republican O
nomination O
for O
governor O
. O

And O
US O
Rep. O
Peter B-PER
Meijer I-PER
, O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
last O
year O
after O
January O
6 O
, O
went O
down O
to O
defeat O
in O
the O
GOP O
primary O
to O
another O
Trump-backed O
election O
denier O
in O
the O
3rd O
Congressional O
District O
. O

Trump’s O
pick O
for O
Kansas B-LOC
governor O
( O
Derek B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
) O
won O
his O
primary O
as O
well O
. O

The O
former O
President O
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
this O
primary O
season O
in O
GOP O
contests O
with O
no O
incumbents O
or O
those O
featuring O
two O
sitting O
lawmakers O
because O
of O
redistricting O

By O
my O
count O
, O
his O
candidates O
have O
won O
slightly O
less O
than O
90% O
of O
contested O
primaries O
for O
governor O
or O
Congress O
that O
had O
either O
no O
incumbents O
or O
two O
incumbents O
because O
of O
redistricting O
. O

That’s O
a O
strong O
number, O
though O
down O
from O
the O
96% O
of O
such O
primaries O
his O
candidates O
won O
in O
the O
2020 O
cycle. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
only O
major O
contest O
from O
the O
past O
week O
that O
a O
Trump B-ORG
candidate O
lost O
was O
in O
the O
open O
primary O
for O
Washington’s B-LOC
4th O
District O
. O

GOP O
Rep. O
Dan B-PER
Newhouse I-PER
advanced O
to O
the O
general O
election O
under O
the O
state’s O
top O
two O
primary O
system O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
voted O
to O
impeach O

and O
had O
to O
withstand O
a O
challenge O
from O
the O
Trump-endorsed O
Loren B-PER
Culp I-PER
, O
who O
has O
been O
in O
third O
place O
. O

But O
even O
Newhouse’s B-PER
advancement O
proves O
the O
point O
that O
Trump B-PER
remains O
a O
power O
center O
in O
the O
GOP O

As O
of O
Sunday O
, O
Newhouse B-PER
was O
pulling O
in O
a O
little O
more O
than O
25% O
of O
the O
primary O
vote O
and O
only O
34% O
of O
those O
who O
voted O
for O
a O

candidate O
in O
the O
district O
. O

That O
is O
incredibly O
weak O
for O
a O
sitting O
member O
of O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Indeed O
, O
Newhouse B-PER
and O
California’s O
David B-PER
Valadao I-PER
, O
the O
only O
other O
Republican O
so O
far O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
and O
made O
it O
to O
the O
November O
ballot O
, O
have O
commanded O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
primary O
vote O
. O

And O
both O
have O
done O
so O
in O
primaries O
where O
all O
candidates O
, O
regardless O
of O
party O
affiliation O
, O
ran O
on O
the O
same O
ballot O
with O
the O
top O
two O
vote-getters O
advancing O
to O
November O
– O
which O
means O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
non-Republicans O
voting O
. O

Trump’s B-PER
success O
in O
primaries O
this O
season O
shouldn’t O
be O
all O
that O
surprising O
given O
the O
national O
polls O

His O
very O
favorable O
rating O
among O
Republicans B-ORG
is O
in O
the O
low O
50s O

This O
is O
down O
from O
around O
70% O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
2020 O
campaign O
, O
but O
it O
means O
that O
a O
little O
more O
than O
half O
of O
Republicans O
really O
like O
Trump B-PER

There O
isn’t O
another O
active O
candidate O
who O
comes O
close O
to O
that O
level O
of O
adoration O

Speaking O
of O
candidates O
who O
aren’t O
Trump B-PER
, O
few O
nonincumbents O
have O
ever O
polled O
at O
or O
above O
where O
Trump B-PER
is O
currently O
in O
early O
national O
presidential O
primary O
polls O
– O
he’s O
at O
about O
50% O
of O
the O
national O
primary O
vote O
. O

The O
non-Trump O
candidates O
to O
have O
done O
so O
in O
the O
modern O
primary O
era O
appear O
to O
be O
Democrats O
Al B-PER
Gore I-PER
, O
in O
1998 O
, O
and O
Hillary B-PER
Clinton I-PER
, O
in O
2014 O
. O

Both O
went O
on O
to O
win O
their O
party’s O
nomination O
in O
the O
next O
presidential O
election O

The O
closest O
Republicans O
were O
George B-PER
H.W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
in O
1986 O
and O
George B-PER
W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
in O
1998 O

Both O
were O
polling O
in O
the O
low O
40s O
and O
would O
go O
on O
to O
win O
the O
GOP O
nomination O

While O
it O
is O
true O
Florida B-LOC
Gov. O
Ron B-PER
DeSantis I-PER
has O
been O
gaining O
on O
Trump B-PER
nationally O
, O
he’s O
still O
about O
25 O
points O
behind O
him O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
best O
way O
to O
understand O
Trump’s B-PER
standing O
in O
the O
GOP O
is O
to O
look O
at O
the O
verbs O
“could” O
and O
“will” O
. O

Trump B-PER
could O
be O
beat O
if O
he O
decides O
to O
run O
for O
the O
Republican B-ORG
nomination O

He O
will O
however O
be O
tough O
to O
beat O

A O
hazy O
picture O
three O
months O
before O
Election O
Day O
Before O
we O
get O
ahead O
of O
ourselves O
with O
all O
this O
2024 O
talk O
, O
there’s O
a O
big O
election O
to O
be O
held O
this O
year O
! O

The O
2022 O
midterms O
are O
only O
about O
three O
months O
away O
, O
and O
the O
picture O
has O
become O
more O
uncertain O
as O
we O
approach O
the O
date O
. O

Normally O
, O
midterms O
follow O
a O
simple O
pattern O
. O

The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
party O
loses O
seats O
in O
Congress B-ORG
( O
especially O
the O
House O
) O

This O
is O
especially O
the O
case O
when O
the O
incumbent O
president O
has O
an O
approval O
rating O
below O
50 O
. O

Biden’s B-PER
approval O
rating O
is O
below O
40% O
. O

Yet, O
the O
generic O
congressional O
ballot O
keeps O
getting O
tighter. O

The O
3-point O
lead O
Republicans B-ORG
held O
in O
May O
has O
completely O
disappeared O
by O
now O
. O

The O
generic O
ballot O
usually O
asks O
respondents O
some O
form O
of O
the O
following O
question O
: O
“ O
If O
the O
elections O
for O
Congress B-ORG
were O
held O
today O
, O
would O
you O
vote O
for O
the O
Democratic B-ORG
or O
Republican B-ORG
party O
?” O

This O
is O
unusual O

Often, O
the O
challenging O
party O
improves O
its O
position O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
midterm O
cycle. O

The O
haziness O
in O
the O
national O
environment O
can O
be O
tied O
to O
what O
voters O
feel O
are O
the O
important O
issues O
of O
the O
day O

Yes O
, O
the O
economy O
is O
the O
No O
. O

1 O
issue O

And O
yes O
inflation O
remains O
historically O
high O

This O
has O
led O
to O
a O
decline O
in O
real O
disposable O
income O
per O
capita O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O
money O
Americans B-LOC
have O
to O
spend O
. O

Yet, O
there O
are O
facets O
of O
the O
economy O
that O
are O
quite O
good O
or O
at O
least O
improving. O

We O
are O
tied O
for O
the O
lowest O
unemployment O
rate O
in O
over O
50 O
years O

The O
stock O
market O
is O
up O

Gas O
prices O
are O
down O
from O
their O
June B-LOC
peak O

Moreover O
, O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
besides O
the O
economy O
at O
play O
. O

Abortion O
may O
not O
rank O
as O
high O
on O
the O
list O
of O
voter O
priorities O
as O
the O
economy O
, O
but O
more O
Americans B-LOC
than O
at O
any O
point O
since O
at O
least O
1984 O
say O
it O
is O
a O
top O
problem O
. O

We O
saw O
this O
past O
week O
that O
abortion O
can O
motivate O
voters O

Democrats O
saw O
a O
massive O
increase O
in O
voter O
turnout O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
compared O
with O
every O
other O
primary O
so O
far O
this O
season O

Answering O
the O
question O
of O
who O
will O
control O
Congress B-ORG
next O
year O
has O
become O
muddled O
in O
another O
way O
as O
well O
: O
The O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
may O
be O
controlled O
by O
different O
parties O
. O

Democrats O
will O
likely O
lose O
the O
House O
, O
even O
as O
the O
national O
picture O
for O
them O
improves O
. O

They O
just O
have O
too O
much O
exposure O

Democrats O
, O
though O
, O
are O
no O
more O
than O
a O
slight O
underdog O
in O
their O
effort O
to O
retain O
Senate O
control O
. O

We’ve O
seen O
good O
recent O
polling O
for O
them O
in O
battleground O
states O
such O
Georgia B-LOC
and O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
. O

Those O
same O
polls O
reveal O
that O
Republicans B-ORG
have O
had O
a O
problem O
nominating O
candidates O
who O
aren’t O
well O
liked O

The O
bottom O
line O
is O
people O
who O
are O
into O
elections O
are O
in O
for O
an O
exciting O
final O
three O
months O

What’s O
Toomey’s B-PER
gripe? O

It’s O
an O
accounting O
dispute O
The O
GOP’s O
ringleader O
obstructing O
passage O
of O
the O
burn O
pits O
legislation O
is O
Sen. O
Pat B-PER
Toomey I-PER
of O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
, O
a O
budget O
hawk O
who O
is O
retiring O
from O
the O
Senate O
and O
so O
is O
no O
longer O
facing O
voters O
. O

His O
problem O
is O
the O
versions O
of O
the O
bill O
considered O
earlier O
this O
year O
assumed O
money O
for O
the O
burn O
pits O
care O
would O
be O
appropriated O
in O
the O
regular O
appropriations O
process O
each O
year O
by O
the O
Senate B-ORG

The O
version O
senators O
are O
currently O
considering O
would O
make O
the O
fund O
essentially O
permanent O
and O
place O
it O
in O
the O
category O
of O
“mandatory” O
spending O
, O
meaning O
it’s O
guaranteed O
forever O
, O
but O
also O
could O
create O
some O
coveted O
space O
in O
the O
discretionary O
budget O
. O

Toomey’s O
specific O
concern O
is O
Section O
805 O
of O
a O
very O
long O
bill O
text O

With O
the O
title O
“Cost B-ORG
of O
War B-ORG
Toxic I-ORG
Exposures I-ORG
Fund,” I-ORG
the O
language O
makes O
clear O
that, O
“No O
amount O
appropriated O
to O
the O
Fund B-ORG
in O
fiscal O
year O
2023 O
or O
any O
subsequent O
fiscal O
year O
pursuant O
to O
this O
section O
shall O
be O
counted O
as O
discretionary O
budget O
authority O
and O
outlays O
or O
as O
direct O
spending O
… O
Toomey B-PER
is O
unapologetic O
for O
opposing O
this O
tweak O
and O
standing O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
bill. O

He O
explained O
his O
position O
on O
“State O
of O
the O
Union” O
on O
Sunday O
, O
in O
a O
long O
conversation O
with O
CNN’s B-ORG
Jake B-PER
Tapper I-PER
. O

We O
are O
spending O
way O
too O
much O
money O
, O
to O
use O
– O
to O
hide O
behind O
a O
veterans O
bill O
the O
opportunity O
to O
go O
on O
an O
unrelated O
$400 O
billion O
spending O
spree O
is O
wrong O
, O
” O
Toomey B-PER
said O
. O

He O
worries O
that O
by O
switching O
the O
burn O
pits O
fund O
from O
discretionary O
to O
mandatory O
spending O
, O
it O
would O
free O
up O
$400 O
billion O
in O
space O
on O
the O
discretionary O
spending O
books O
that O
lawmakers O
will O
use O
for O
something O
else O
. O

Now O
when O
you O
create O
that O
big O
hole O
, O
guess O
what O
happens O
to O
that O
big O
hole O
, O
” O
Toomey B-PER
said O
on O
the O
Senate B-ORG
floor O
last O
month O
. O
“ O

It O
gets O
filled O
with O
spending O
on O
who O
knows O
what O

That’s O
what’s O
going O
on O
here O
.” O

It O
may O
be O
a O
valid O
gripe O
, O
but O
a O
bill O
to O
help O
veterans O
sickened O
by O
burn O
pits O
while O
they O
were O
at O
war O
is O
an O
awkward O
place O
to O
make O
a O
stand O
. O

It’s O
even O
more O
awkward O
since O
25 O
Republicans O
who O
voted O
for O
a O
previous O
version O
of O
the O
bill O
are O
now O
standing O
in O
its O
way O

What O
do O

say O
? O

Veterans O
protesting O
around O
the O
clock O
on O
Capitol B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
argue O
any O
wait O
is O
too O
long O

They O
want O
the O
bill O
passed O
now O

And O
they’re O
worried O
that O
if O
the O
spending O
isn’t O
made O
part O
of O
the O
mandatory O
budget O
, O
it O
could O
be O
taken O
away O
in O
the O
future O

appearance O

McDonough B-PER
said O
Toomey’s B-PER
approach O
would O
put O
an O
annual O
cap O
on O
how O
much O
could O
go O
into O

, O
potentially O
end O
the O

after O
10 O
years O

even O
possibly O
require O

be O
withheld O
from O

exposure O

burn O

If O
his O

are O
wrong O
about O
what O
we O
will O
spend O
in O

What’s O
the O
subtext O
here O
? O

Republicans B-ORG
feel O
played O
that O
Democrats B-ORG
are O
on O
the O
cusp O
of O
using O
reconciliation O
– O
a O
very O
different O
budget O
gimmick O
both O
sides O
have O
used O
in O
recent O
years O
– O
to O
pass O
health O
care O
and O
climate O
legislation O

The O
deal O
among O
Democrats B-ORG
for O
the O
health O
and O
climate O
legislation O
was O
hatched O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
with O
Sen. O
Joe B-PER
Manchin I-PER
of O
West B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
. O

It O
was O
announced O
just O
after O
Republicans B-ORG
helped O
pass O
a O
bipartisan O
bill O
to O
prop O
up O
a O
US O
semiconductor O
industry O
. O

Lawmakers O
of O
all O
stripes O
want O
to O
wrap O
up O
their O
work O
and O
get O
out O
on O
the O
campaign O
trail O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
August B-LOC
since O
the O
November B-LOC
midterm O
election O
is O
fast O
approaching O

Possible O
ways O
out O
Republicans B-ORG
could O
buckle O
to O
public O
pressure O
to O
allow O
a O
vote O
on O
the O
measure O
, O
which O
has O
plenty O
of O
support O
to O
pass O
. O

Democrats O
could O
buckle O
to O
Republican O
pressure O
to O
allow O
consideration O
of O
amendments O
and O
potentially O
changing O
budget O
language O
in O
the O
bill O

Or, O
neither O
side O
buckles O
and O
the O
burn O
pits O
legislation O
dies. O

Both O
sides O
want O
to O
pass O
the O
bill O
, O
ultimately O
. O

Republicans B-ORG
probably O
won’t O
mind O
if O
it O
takes O
a O
bit O
longer O
and O
further O
complicates O
Democrats’ B-ORG
other O
priorities O

Three O

told O

made O
as O
part O
of O

into O
the O

, O
according O
to O
a O
person O

Jean-Pierre B-PER

on O
Tuesday O
that O

the O

it O
“would O

two O

Republicans O

rushed O
to O
Trump’s B-PER

following O
the O

, O
with O
many O
calling O
on O
the O
FBI B-ORG
to O
explain O
the O
reasoning O
behind O
the O
operation O

House O
Minority O

Kevin B-PER
McCarthy I-PER
alleged O
that O
the O

“has O
reached O
an O

McCarthy B-PER
in O
a O

This O

A O
Texas B-LOC
jury O
has O
decided O
to O
penalize O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
with O
$ O
45.2 O
million O

a O

Jesse B-PER

Plaintiffs O

awarded O
a O

both O

Of O
the O
total O
$49.3 O

the O
$45.2 O

may O

Care O
and O
concern O
is O
so O
important O
and O
we O
saw O
what O
happens O
when O
there O
is O
a O
dearth O
of O
that O
, O
and O
so O
I O
hope O
that O
we O
all O
just O
go O
home O
tonight O
and O
everybody O
that’s O
reading O
these O
articles O
and O
hearing O
this O
message O
and O
you O
chose O
love O
with O
your O
kids O
, O
because O
you O
can O
, O
Lewis B-PER
said O
Friday O
after O
learning O
of O
the O
jury’s O
decision O
. O

That O
means O
being O
present O
in O
the O
moment O
with O
them O
, O
looking O
into O
their O
eyes O
, O
giving O
them O
a O
hug O
and O
just O
moving O
from O
there O
. O

Just O
every O
moment O
, O
realize O
that O
you O
have O
a O
choice O
and O
your O
choice O
is O
love O
. O

The O
jurors O
began O
deliberating O
around O
12:30 O
pm O
CT O
on O
Friday O
, O
after O
Judge O
Maya B-PER
Guerra I-PER
Gamble I-PER
reminded O
them O
that O
in O
a O
default O
judgment O
against O
him O
Jones B-PER
was O
already O
found O
liable O
for O
defamation O
and O
“ O
intentional O
infliction O
of O
emotional O
distress O
” O
against O
Lewis B-PER
and O
Heslin B-PER
. O

In O
an O
emotional O
closing O
argument O
Friday O
, O
Lewis B-PER
and O
Heslin’s B-PER
attorney O
Wesley B-PER
Todd I-PER
Ball I-PER
had O
said O
to O
the O
jury O
, O
“ O
We O
ask O
that O
you O
send O
a O
very O
very O
simple O
message O
, O
and O
that O
is O
, O
stop O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
. O
” O

Stop O
the O
monetization O
of O
misinformation O
and O
lies O
. O

Please O

After O
the O
jury’s O
decision O
was O
announced O
in O
court O
, O
Jones’ O
attorney O
, O
Andino B-PER
Reynal I-PER
, O
immediately O
raised O
the O
issue O
of O
Texas B-LOC
law O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
punitive O
damages O
. O

Following O
the O
proceeding O
, O
he O
addressed O
it O
again O
while O
speaking O
outside O
the O
court O
. O

We O
think O
the O
verdict O
was O
too O
high O

As O
for O
punitive O
damages O
, O
Texas B-LOC
law O
caps O
them O
at O
$750,000 O
per O
plaintiff O
so O
this O
verdict O
today O
amounts O
to O
$1.5 O
million O
in O
punitives O
. O

Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
will O
be O
on O
the O
air O
today O
, O
he’ll O
be O
on O
the O
air O
tomorrow O
, O
he’ll O
be O
on O
the O
air O
next O
week O
. O

He’s O
going O
to O
keep O
doing O
his O
job O
holding O
the O
power O
structure O
accountable O

That’s O
our O
only O
statement,” O
Reynal B-PER
said O
after O
court. O

Judge O
Gamble B-PER
acknowledged O
Reynal’s O
objection O
in O
court O
but O
did O
not O
immediately O
rule O
on O
it O
. O

So O
we O
do O
have O
laws O
in O
Texas B-LOC
where O
we O
claim O
to O
trust O
our O
juries O
and O
then O
we O
don’t O
trust O
our O
juries O
, O
and O
that’s O
true O
, O
Gamble B-PER
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O

And O
I’m O
sure O
the O
judgment O
will O
properly O
reflect O
that O
laws O
of O
Texas B-LOC
in O
that O
regard O
, O
so O
don’t O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
that O
. O

CNN B-ORG
has O
reached O
out O
to O
an O
attorney O
for O
the O
plaintiffs O
for O
comment O
on O
Reynal’s B-PER
argument O

During O
closing O
arguments O
, O
Ball B-PER
had O
urged O
the O
jurors O
to O
“ O
deter O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
from O
ever O
doing O
this O
awfulness O
again O
” O
and O
“ O
to O
deter O
others O
who O
may O
want O
to O
step O
into O
his O
shoes O
. O

Reynal O
had O
argued O
for O
a O
far O
lower O
sum O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
jurors O
should O
multiply O
Jones’ O
purported O
earnings O
per O
hour O
of O
$14,000 O
and O
the O
18 O
hours O
that O
he O
said O
Jones O
talked O
about O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC
on O
Infowars B-ORG
, O
for O
a O
sum O
of O
around O
a O
quarter O
million O
dollars O
. O

On O
Thursday O
, O
in O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
the O
jury O
awarded O
the O
parents O
$4.1 O
million O
in O
compensatory O
damages O
, O
a O
far O
smaller O
amount O
than O
the O
$150 O
million O
the O
parents’ O
attorneys O
had O
sought O
. O

In O
his O
closing O
argument O
, O
Ball B-PER
thanked O
the O
jury O
for O
their O
decision O
to O
award O
the O
$4.1 O
million O
, O
saying O
it O
had O
already O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
in O
the O
parents’ O
lives O
, O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
award O
enough O
in O
punitive O
damages O
to O
bring O
the O
total O
to O
$150 O
million O
. O

Punitive O
damages O
are O
a O
form O
of O
punishment O
for O
a O
defendant’s O
behavior O

Jones O
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
conspiratorial O
media O
outlet O
Infowars B-ORG
, O
repeatedly O
lied O
about O
the O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC
massacre O
. O

He O
stoked O
conspiracy O
theories O
about O
the O
victims O
and O
their O
families O
, O
prompting O
multiple O
defamation O
lawsuits O
. O

He O
has O
since O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
mass O
shooting O
occurred O

Jones O
claimed O
in O
his O
testimony O
that O
a O
jury O
award O
of O
just O
$2 O
million O
would O
destroy O
him O
financially O

But O
on O
Friday O
morning O
the O
jurors O
heard O
testimony O
about O
Jones O
’ O
wealth O
from O
an O
economist O
, O
Bernard B-PER
Pettingill I-PER
, O
Jr. O
, O
who O
estimated O
Jones O
has O
a O
net O
worth O
of O
between O
$135 O
million O
and O
$270 O
million O
. O

Pettingill B-PER
Jr. O
, O
who O
examined O
several O
years O
of O
records O
for O
Jones O
and O
Infowars’ B-ORG
parent O
Free B-ORG
Speech I-ORG
Systems I-ORG
, O
said O
Jones O
used O
a O
series O
of O
shell O
companies O
to O
hide O
his O
money O
. O

Jones O
used O
two O
large O
loans O
to O
make O
it O
appear O
he O
was O
broke O
when O
in O
fact O
he O
was O
not O
, O
Pettingill B-PER
, O
Jr. I-PER
testified O
. O

“ O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
knows O
where O
the O
money O
is O
, O
he O
knows O
where O
that O
money O
went O
and O
he O
knows O
that O
he O
is O
going O
to O
eventually O
benefit O
by O
that O
money O
, O
” O
Pettingill B-PER
, O
Jr. O
said O
. O

After O
one O
of O
the O
jurors O
asked O
about O
the O
difference O
between O
Jones’ O
money O
and O
his O
company’s O
money O
, O
Pettingill B-PER
, O
Jr. I-PER
said O
“ O
you O
cannot O
separate O
Alex B-PER
Jones I-PER
from O
the O
companies O
. O

He O
is O
the O
companies O
.” O

Jones O
“monetized O
his O
shtick,” O
he O
added, O
even O
suggesting O
that O
Jones O
could O
teach O
a O
college O
course O
about O
his O
techniques. O

Jones O
’ O
fear-mongering O
rants O
on O
Infowars B-ORG
have O
, O
for O
many O
years O
, O
been O
paired O
with O
ads O
for O

, O
documentaries O
, O
and O
other O
products O

. O

Pettingill B-PER
, O
Jr. O
said O
the O
money O
poured O
in O
, O
identifying O
nine O
different O
companies O
that O
are O
owned O
by O
Jones O
. O

He O
is O
a O
very O
successful O
man O
, O
he O
promulgated O
some O
hate O
speech O
and O
some O
misinformation O
, O
but O
he O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
he O
monetized O
that O
, O
Pettingill B-PER
, O
Jr. I-PER
said O
on O
the O
stand O
. O

My O
thinking O
about O
him O
is O
he O
didn’t O
ride O
a O
wave O
, O
he O
created O
the O
wave O
.” O

Jones O
testified O
earlier O
in O
the O
week O
about O
his O
alleged O
financial O
troubles O
after O
social O
media O
giants O
like O
Facebook B-ORG
and O
Twitter B-ORG
banned O
his O
content O
from O
their O
platforms O

I O
remember O
him O
saying O
that O
, O
but O
the O
records O
don’t O
reflect O
that O
, O
Pettingill B-PER
, O
Jr I-PER
said O
. O

During O
closing O
arguments O
, O
Ball B-PER
asserted O
that O
Jones B-PER
has O
even O
more O
money O
hidden O
away O
in O
other O
places O
and O
argued O
that O
$4.1 O
million O
was O
a O
drop O
in O
Jones’ B-PER
proverbial O
bucket O
. O

He’s O
probably O
already O
made O
it O
back O
in O
donations” O
from O
fans, O

said. O

A O
near-Earth O
asteroid O
named O
Bennu O
has O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
full O
of O
surprises O
– O
the O
latest O
of O
which O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
a O
surface O
similar O
to O
a O
pit O
of O
plastic O
balls O
, O
according O
to O
NASA B-ORG
scientists O

The O
new O
revelation O
comes O
after O
the O
space O
agency O
successfully O
collected O
a O
sample O
from O
the O
asteroid O
in O
October O
2020 O

During O
the O

collection O
event O
, O
the O
sampling O
head O
of O
the O
OSIRIS-REx B-ORG

sank O
1.6 O
feet O
( O
0.5 O
meter O
) O
into O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
asteroid O

Apparently O
, O
Bennu’s O
exterior O
is O
made O
of O
loosely O
packed O
particles O
that O
aren’t O
bound O
together O
very O
securely O
, O
based O
on O
what O
happened O
as O
the O
spacecraft O
collected O
a O
sample O
. O

If O
the O
spacecraft O
hadn’t O
fired O
its O
thruster O
to O
back O
away O
after O
its O
quick O
collection O
of O
dust O
and O
rocks O
, O
it O
might O
have O
sunk O
right O
into O
the O
asteroid O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
fired O
our O

If O
Bennu O

that O
would O

We O
were O
like O
‘Holy O
cow!’ O

Every O
time O
we O
tested O
the O
sample O
pickup O
procedure O
in O
the O
lab O

we O
barely O
made O
a O

Before O

after O
photos O

show O
the O
dramatic O
difference O

The O
images O
reveal O
what O
looks O
like O
a O
depression O
in O
the O
surface O
, O
with O
several O
large O
boulders O
at O
its O
base O
. O

The O
sampling O
event O
itself O
likely O
caused O
this O
sunken O
landform O

The O
dark O
surface O
of O
the O

has O
more O
reflective O

showing O
where O

during O

These O
changes O
are O
evident O
in O
the O

When O
analyzing O
the O
spacecraft’s O
acceleration O
data O
, O
the O
team O
determined O
that O
it O
encountered O
very O
little O
resistance O

about O
the O

Understanding O
more O
about O
Bennu’s B-LOC

can O
help O

whether O
the O

plan O
missions O

OSIRIS-REx B-ORG

protect O

An O
asteroid O
like O
Bennu B-LOC
, O
barely O
holding O
itself O
together O
, O
could O
break O
apart O
in O
Earth’s B-LOC
atmosphere O
, O
which O
might O
pose O
other O
risks O
even O
if O
it’s O
not O
a O
direct O
hit O
. O

We O
need O
to O
keep O
interacting O
physically O
with O
those O
bodies O
because O
this O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
really O
determine O
their O
mechanical O
properties O
and O
response O
to O
external O
actions O

Once O

the O

warned O
that O
the O
landmark O

“ O

the O
actions O
of O
Russia B-LOC

but O
also O
of O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC

Officials O
have O
acknowledged O
the O
challenges O
that O
Russia’s B-LOC
war O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
will O
present O
at O
the O
review O
conference O
– O
which O
is O
typically O
held O
every O

document O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
month-long O

In O
his O
remarks O
, O
Blinken B-PER
noted O
that O
Russia B-LOC
had O
joined O
with O
the O
other O
NPT O
nuclear O
states O
– O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
United B-LOC
Kingdom I-LOC
, O
France B-LOC
, O
and O
China B-LOC
– O
in O
a O
joint O
statement O
in O
January O
emphasizing O
the O
importance O
of O
avoiding O
nuclear O
war O
and O
arms O
races O
, O
but O
“ O
the O
very O
next O
month O
, O
Russia B-LOC
launched O
a O
full O
scale O
invasion O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O
” O

It’s O
engaging O
in O
reckless O
, O
dangerous O
nuclear O
saber O
rattling O
, O
with O
its O
president O
warning O
that O
those O
supporting O
Ukraine B-LOC
self-defense O
‘risk O
consequences O
such O
as O
you O
have O
never O
seen O
in O
your O
entire O
history O

, O
Blinken B-PER
said O
. O

Earlier O
on O
Monday O
, O
UN B-ORG
Secretary-General O
Antonio B-PER
Guterres I-PER
issued O
a O
stark O
warning O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
meeting O
. O

Today O
, O
humanity O
is O
just O
one O
misunderstanding O
, O
one O
miscalculation O
away O
from O
nuclear O
annihilation O
,” O
Guterres B-PER
said O
. O

We O
need O
the O
treaty O
on O
non-proliferation O
of O
Nuclear B-ORG
Weapons I-ORG
as O
much O
as O
ever O

That’s O
why O
this O
Review O
Conference O
is O
so O
important O
. O

It’s O
an O
opportunity O
to O
hammer-out O
the O
measures O
that O
will O
help O
avoid O
certain O
disaster O
. O

Unlike O
in O
January O
, O
only O
three O
of O
the O
NPT B-ORG
nuclear O
states O
– O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
UK B-LOC
, O
and O
France B-LOC
– O
released O
a O
joint O
statement O
Monday O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
conference O
, O
in O
which O
they O
called O
on O
Russia B-LOC
“ O
to O
cease O
its O
irresponsible O
and O
dangerous O
nuclear O
rhetoric O
and O
behaviour O
, O
to O
uphold O
its O
international O
commitments O
, O
and O
to O
recommit O
– O
in O
words O
and O
deeds O
– O
to O
the O
principles O
enshrined O
in O
the O
recent O
Preventing O
Nuclear O
War O
and O
Avoiding O
Arms O
Races O
Leaders’ O
statement O
, O
referencing O
the O
one O
released O
in O
January O
. O

Blinken B-PER
said O
Russia’s B-LOC
war O
is O
in O
violation O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
Charter I-ORG
, O
the O
rules-based O
international O
order O
, O
and O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
Memorandum I-ORG
– O
the O
1994 O
agreement O
under O
which O
Russia B-LOC
pledged O
to O
respect O
Ukraine’s B-LOC
sovereignty O
and O
Kyiv B-LOC
agreed O
to O
forfeit O
its O
nuclear O
weapon O
arsenal O
. O

What O
message O
does O
this O
send O
to O
any O
country O
around O
the O
world O
that O
may O
think O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
have O
nuclear O
weapons O
to O
protect O
, O
to O
defend O
, O
to O
deter O
aggression O
against O
its O
sovereignty O
and O
independence O
. O

The O
worst O
possible O
message,” O
he O
said. O
“ O

And O
so O
it’s O
directly O
relevant O
to O
what’s O
going O
on O
here O
this O
month O
at O
the O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. O

Most O
recently O
, O
we O
saw O
Russia’s B-LOC
aggression O
with O
its O
seizure O
of O
Ukraine’s B-LOC
Zaporizhzhia B-LOC
nuclear O
power O
plant O
, O
the O
largest O
such O
plant O
in O
all O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
” O
Blinken B-PER
continued O
. O

Russia B-LOC
is O
now O
using O
the O
plant O
as O
a O
military O
base O
to O
fire O
at O
Ukrainians B-LOC
, O
knowing O
that O
they O
can’t O
and O
won’t O
shoot O
back O
because O
they O
might O
accidentally O
strike O
a O
reactor O
or O
highly O
radioactive O
waste O
in O
storage O
. O

That O
brings O
the O
notion O
of O
having O
a O
human O
shield O
to O
an O
entirely O
different O
and O
horrific O
level O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

Blinken B-PER
contrasted O
the O
actions O
by O
Moscow B-LOC
to O
those O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
, O
which O
he O
said O
has O
sought O
to O
avoid O
escalation O
“ O
by O
forgoing O
previously O
scheduled O
ICBM O
tests O
and O
not O
raising O
the O
alert O
status O
of O
our O
nuclear O
forces O
in O
response O
to O
Russian B-LOC
saber O
rattling O
.” O

There O
is O
no O
place O
in O
our O
world O
, O
no O
place O
in O
our O
world O
for O
nuclear O
deterrence O
based O
on O
coercion O
, O
intimidation O
, O
or O
blackmail O
,” O
he O
said O
. O

Blinken B-PER
also O
called O
out O
North B-LOC
Korea I-LOC
for O
its O
nuclear O
provocations O
, O
noting O
that O
“as O
we O
gather O
today O
, O
Pyongyang B-LOC
is O
preparing O
to O
conduct O
its O
seventh O
nuclear O
test O
. O
” O

The O
top O
US O
diplomat O
said O
“ O
Iran B-LOC
remains O
on O
a O
path O
of O
nuclear O
escalation O
.” O

Although O
it O
publicly O
claims O
to O
favor O
return O
to O
mutual O
compliance O
with O
the O
JCPOA O
, O
the O
Joint B-ORG

either O
unwilling O

unable O
to O
accept O
the O

to O
achieve O
precisely O
that O
goal O
, O
” O
Blinken B-PER
said O
. O

Getting O
back O
to O
the O

remains O
the O
best O
outcome O

Lucy B-PER
Yu I-PER
found O
refuge O
in O
books O
growing O
up O
. O

An O
only O
child O
raised O
by O
a O
Chinese O
immigrant O
mother O
in O
west O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
, O
she O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
bookstores O
. O

But O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
stories O
she O
connected O
to O
most O
– O
those O
written O
by O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
– O
were O
often O
relegated O
to O
a O
single O
shelf O
or O
a O
heritage O
month O
display O
. O

I O
just O
wanted O
to O
walk O
into O
a O
place O
where O
I O
didn’t O
have O
to O
search O
that O
much,” O
she O
said. O

Yu O
, O
a O
chemical O
engineer O
by O
training O
, O
started O
researching O
and O
found O
an O
abundance O
of O
titles O
going O
back O
decades O
from O
authors O
with O
names O
or O
backgrounds O
like O
hers O
. O

But O
she O
said O
many O
of O
those O
books O
had O
quickly O
been O
placed O
on O
the O
backlist O
, O
a O
publishing O
term O
referring O
to O
older O
books O
that O
are O
still O
in O
print O
but O
typically O
aren’t O
being O
actively O
promoted O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
publishing O
industry O
didn’t O
think O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
sell O
or O
didn’t O
think O
that O
people O
were O
interested O
in O
our O
stories O
,” O
Yu B-PER
added O
. O

But O
they O
had O
always O
been O
there O
and O
these O
authors O
and O
these O
writers O
and O
these O
stories O
have O
always O
been O
there O
. O

Yu O
launched O
a O
crowdfunding O
campaign O
last O
year O
to O
turn O
her O
vision O
into O
reality O
, O
and O
hit O
her O
goal O
in O
just O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
affirming O
that O
she O
wasn’t O
alone O
in O
wanting O
more O
of O
these O
books O
. O

In O
December O
, O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me O
Books B-ORG
opened O
its O
doors O
in O
Manhattan’s B-LOC
Chinatown I-LOC
, O
and O
has O
been O
steadily O
growing O
since O
. O

The O
store O
now O
has O
four O
staff O
members O
, O
including O
Yu O
. O

The O
bookstore O
has O
also O
become O
a O
literary O
and O
community O
hub O

Yu O

Me O
Books B-ORG
has O
hosted O
conversations O
with O

And O
as O
Asian O
Americans O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
including O
Chinatown B-LOC
, O
faced O
attacks O
against O
their O
communities O
, O
the O

partnered O
with O
the O
nonprofit O
Soar B-ORG
Over I-ORG
Hate I-ORG
to O
hand O
out O
free O
pepper O

and O
personal O

. O

Yu O
sees O
room O
for O
progress O
in O
publishing O
Despite O
this O
, O
Yu B-PER
didn’t O
set O
out O
to O
open O
an O
Asian O
American O
bookstore O
. O

When O
she O
first O
conceived O
of O
her O
small O
business O
, O
she O
dreamed O
of O
a O
space O
that O
would O
reflect O
the O
rich O
diversity O
of O
her O
community O
. O

She O
envisioned O
a O
place O
dedicated O
to O
stories O
written O
by O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
– O
which O
happened O
to O
include O
Asian O
American O
authors O

The O
space O
still O
reflects O
her O
vision O
. O

But O
perhaps O
because O
of O
Yu’s B-PER
own O
Asian O
American O
identity O
, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
her O
bookstore’s O
historic O
location O
or O
perhaps O
because O
of O
a O
hunger O
among O
Asian O
Americans O
for O
authentic O
depictions O
of O
their O
communities O
, O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
has O
since O
become O
a O
go-to O
for O
Asian O
American O
readers O
hoping O
to O
find O
their O
experiences O
reflected O
on O
its O
shelves O
. O

It’s O
been O
really O
interesting O
seeing O
how O
I’ve O
kind O
of O
been O
pushed O
into O
the O
Asian O
American O
bookstores O
lane O
she O
said O
“ O

I O
think O
that O
if O
I O
weren’t O
Asian O
American O
, O
I O
may O
not O
have O
had O
to O
put O
myself O
within O
that O
slot O
.” O

That O
feeling O
of O
being O
pigeonholed O
is O
familiar O
for O
many O
Asian O
Americans O
, O
whether O
they O
work O
in O
media O
, O
the O
restaurant O
industry O
or O
the O
literary O
scene O
like O
Yu O

For O
so O
long O
, O
Asian O
American O
representation O
in O
creative O
sectors O
has O
been O
scarce O
, O
while O
Asian O
American O
depictions O
in O
popular O
culture O
have O
been O
replete O
with O
tired O
tropes O
and O
stereotypes O
. O

So O
when O
Yu B-PER
launched O
her O
community-centered O
bookstore O
last O
year O
, O
it O
came O
with O
added O
pressure O
and O
expectations O
. O

While O
Yu B-PER
has O
held O
to O
her O
mission O
of O
highlighting O
stories O
of O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
more O
broadly O
, O
she O
’ O
s O
leaned O
into O
customers’ O
demand O
for O
books O
by O
Asian O
American O
authors O
. O

Most O
of O
her O
inventory O
now O
skews O
toward O
Asian O
American O
books O
, O
she O
said O
– O
making O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
a O
rare O
and O
special O
place O
. O

As O
someone O
who’s O
thinking O
about O
my O
own O
identity O
and O
also O
a O
business O
owner O
, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
support O
whoever O
wants O
to O
come O
in O
and O
find O
books O
that O
represent O
themselves O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O

But O
I O
love O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
love O
and O
desire O
for O
Asian O
American O
books O
and O
representation O
. O

Still, O
Yu B-PER
makes O
it O
a O
point O
to O
both O
challenge O
and O
delight O
visitors O
to O
her O
store. O

Her O
shelves O
include O
bestsellers O
such O
as O

Jin I-PER
Lee I-PER
’s O
“Pachinko” O
and O
Michelle B-PER
Zauner I-PER
’s O
“Crying O
in O
H O
Mart,” O
as O
well O
as O
niche O
titles O
from O
smaller O
presses. O

Visitors O
can O
thumb O
through O
cookbooks O
, O
romance O
novels O
, O
young O
adult O
novels O
and O
poetry O
volumes O
by O
Asian O
American O
authors O
– O
and O
the O
selection O
keeps O
growing O
. O

For O
a O
couple O
hours O
most O
evenings O
, O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
in O
hand O
, O
Yu B-PER
researches O
what O
other O
books O
she O
doesn’t O
yet O
know O
about O
that O
she O
might O
acquire O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
things O
that O
I O
hear O
when O
customers O
come O
in O
the O
store O
( O
is O
) O
‘ O
I’ve O
never O
heard O
of O
this O
title O
before O
’ O
or O
‘ O
I’ve O
never O
seen O
like O
40% O
of O
this O
inventory O
before O
.’ O

Yu O
said O
. O
“ O

That O
makes O
me O
so O
happy O
because O
you O
can O
connect O
to O
a O
story O
that’s O
not O
necessarily O
being O
pushed O
by O
publishers O

As O
Yu B-PER

Me O
Books B-ORG
celebrates O
and O
showcases O
the O
breadth O
of O
works O
that O
Asian O
American O
writers O
have O
produced O
over O
decades O
, O
Yu B-PER
also O
encourages O
her O
visitors O
to O
keep O
an O
open O
mind O
. O

I O
also O
try O
to O
remind O
readers O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
that O
outside O
the O
Asian B-LOC
American I-LOC
experience O
, O
there’s O
so O
many O
books O
written O
by O
other O
immigrants O
that O
we O
can O
relate O
to O
very O
much O
, O
” O
she O
added O
. O

In O
the O
time O
that O
Yu B-PER

Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
has O
been O
open O
, O
Yu B-PER
said O
she’s O
seen O
positive O
changes O
in O
the O
publishing O
industry O
. O

She’s O
seeing O
more O
diversity O
in O
the O
authors O
who O
are O
getting O
published O
, O
but O
those O
authors O
are O
often O
called O
upon O
to O
be O
“educators O
of O
our O
experience,” O
Yu B-PER
said O
. O

As O
exciting O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
these O
experiences O
represented O
authentically O
, O
she O
hopes O
the O
industry O
will O
reach O
a O
point O
where O
authors O
can O
transcend O
their O
identities O
. O

I O
want O
authors O

They O
share O
a O

but O
understand O
the O
importance O
of O
this O

. O

The O
hunters O
are O
the O
best O
way O
we O
have O
at O
this O
moment O
to O
help O
with O
this O
problem O
,” O
Siewe B-PER
said O

Kalil B-PER
grew O
up O

said O
when O
she O
went O
to O

Everglades B-LOC
as O
a O
kid O
there O
were O
“so O
many O
rabbits O
you O
couldn’t O
count O
them O
all O
.” O

Fast O
forward O
to O
the O
2000s O
when O
Kalil B-PER
said O
there O
were O
practically O
no O
rabbits O
, O
possums O
or O
raccoons O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
pythons O
. O

In O

In O
her O
first O
year O
, O
she O
won O
second O
place O
for O

. O

The O
two O
will O
base O
their O
hunting O
on O
factors O
like O
weather O
, O
time O
of O
day O
and O
sleep O
schedule O
. O

This O
time O
of O
the O
year O
, O
the O
nighttime O
is O
best O
to O
go O
out O
, O
” O
Kalil B-PER
said O
. O

And O
hunting O
doesn’t O
come O
easy O

Throughout O
her O
career O
, O
Siewe B-PER
has O
suffered O
from O
many O
python O
bites O
and O
said O
she O
doesn’t O
recommend O
it O
. O

It’s O
like O
a O
warm O
knife O
going O
through O
butter,” O
Siewe B-PER
described. O

Pythons O
, O
while O
not O
venomous O
, O
have O
hundreds O
of O
teeth O
that O
are O
razor O
sharp O
, O
according O
to O
Siewe B-PER

The O
creatures O
can O
grow O
to O
massive O
sizes O
and O
it’s O
a O
feat O
to O
take O
them O
on O

Siewe B-PER
said O
her O
largest O
capture O
measured O
17 O
feet O
and O
110 O
pounds O
, O
which O
she O
caught O
standing O

Kalil B-PER

that O
you O
can’t O
catch O
them O
all O
. O
“ O

I’ve O
had O
four O
get O
away O
from O
me O
during O
my O
career O
” O
she O
said O

It O
can O
be O
difficult O
during O

Extreme O
weather O
on O
both O
ends O
of O
the O
spectrum O
has O
thrashed O
parts O
of O
the O
US B-LOC
over O
the O
past O
week O
– O
one O
of O
the O
many O
signals O
that O
climate O
change O
is O
here O
now O
, O
scientists O
say O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
overwhelming O
rainfall O
triggered O
two O
ultra-rare O
floods O
last O
week O
, O
one O
in O
the O
St. B-LOC
Louis I-LOC
area O
and O
another O
in O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
that O
has O
left O
dozens O
dead O
or O
missing O
. O

On O
the O
other O
, O
a O
fiery O
drought O
has O
fueled O
California’s B-LOC
largest O
wildfire O
of O
the O
year O
so O
far O
– O
the O
McKinney B-LOC
Fire I-LOC
– O
which O
burned O
so O
hot O
over O
the O
weekend O
that O
massive O
pyrocumulus O
clouds O
erupted O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
. O

Expect O
more O
of O
these O
extremes O
as O
the O
planet O
warms O
, O
said O
Kevin B-PER
Reed I-PER
, O
a O
climate O
scientist O
at O
Stony B-ORG
Brook I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
and O
prepare O
for O
them O
. O

Every O
weather O
event O
has O
some O
flavor O
of O
climate O
change O
in O
it O
because O
it’s O
impossible O
to O
decouple O
them O
,” O
Reed B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

It’s O
another O
sign O
that O
climate O
change O
is O
here O

It’s O
not O
just O
a O
challenge O
for O
the O
next O
400 O
years O
from O
now O
or O
50 O
years O
from O
now O
; O
in O
reality O
, O
it’s O
something O
that O
we O
need O
to O
rapidly O
adjust O
to O
, O
adapt O
to O
and O
become O
more O
resilient O
to O
now O
. O

Climate O
experts O
anticipate O
heavy O
rain O
events O
to O
increase O
in O
intensity O
and O
frequency O
as O
the O
planet O
warms O
, O
since O
warmer O
air O
can O
hold O
more O
moisture O
. O

That O
concept O
is O
easier O
for O
most O
people O
to O
grasp O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
hurricane O
, O
Reed B-PER
said O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Hurricane O
Harvey B-PER
in O
2017 O
dumped O
more O
than O
60 O
inches O
of O
rain O
in O
parts O
of O
Texas B-LOC
and O
slammed O
the O
coast O
with O
an O
8-foot O
storm O
surge O
. O

Scientists O
have O
said O
climate O
change O
made O
Harvey’s O
rainfall O
more O
extreme O

But O
that O
same O
process O
plays O
out O
over O
land O
as O
water O
evaporates O
from O
the O
soil O
, O
grass O
, O
crops O
and O
forests O
. O

And O
more O
moisture O
can O
be O
drawn O
out O
of O
soil O
and O
vegetation O
the O
warmer O
it O
gets O

Part O
of O
that O
is O
the O
general O
circulation O
of O
the O
atmosphere-ocean O
system O
which O
moves O
air O
around O
the O
world O
and O
brings O
moisture O
into O
areas O
over O
land O
, O
Reed B-PER
said O
. O

Another O
aspect O
is O
that O
, O
over O
the O
last O
100 O
plus O
years O
, O
the O
land O
surface O
has O
actually O
warmed O
more O
than O
the O
ocean O
, O
so O
the O
largest O
signal O
that O
we’re O
actually O
seeing O
in O
surface O
temperature O
is O
occurring O
overland O
, O
and O
inland O
as O
well O
. O

What O
it O
adds O
up O
to O
is O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
dangerous O
flooding O
. O

While O
extreme O
events O
and O
floods O
have O
sort O
of O
always O
been O
a O
part O
of O
a O
climate O
cycle O
, O
they O
can O
get O
more O
frequent O
and O
they O
can O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
intense O
as O
the O
planet O
is O
warmed O

a O
strong O
connection O

one O
of O
the O
factors O
that O
will O
increase O
the O
risk O
and O
impact O
of O

“ O
In O
many O
ways O
, O
it’s O
these O
isolated O

that O
will O
see O

in O
the O

, O
” O
Smith B-PER
said O
. O

We O
have O
more O
faith O
in O
finding O
( O
a O
climate O
change O
connection O
) O
to O
these O
kinds O
of O
localized O
extreme O
rainfall O
events O
. O

They O
do O
seem O
to O
be O
happening O
more O
frequently,” O
he O
added. O

The O
flooding O
, O
wildfire O
, O
heat O
waves O
and O
drought O
paint O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
nation O
in O
peril O
. O

And O
as O
one O
part O
of O
the O
country O
recovers O
from O
extreme O
rainfall O
, O
another O
can O
be O
scorched O
by O
deadly O
fires O
. O

The O
McKinney B-LOC
fire O
in O

, O
which O
exploded O
in O

over O
the O

so O
far O
this O
year O
, O
burned O
uncontrolled O
Monday O
amid O
the O
West’s B-LOC
historic O
drought O
. O

The O
fire O
generated O
its O
own O
weather O
in O
the O
form O
of O
pyrocumulus O
clouds O
, O
which O
are O
triggered O
by O
intense O
heat O
that O
forces O
air O
to O
rise O
rapidly O
and O
are O
a O
sign O
of O
how O
large O
and O
hot O
the O
fire O
was O
burning O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
forecasters O
at O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Weather I-ORG
Service I-ORG
warned O
that O
“dry O
lightning” O
was O
possible O
Monday O
– O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
is O
made O
more O
likely O
by O
exceptional O
drought O
. O

The O
dry O
air O
evaporates O
the O
storm’s O

before O
it O
ever O

the O

, O
leaving O
only O

, O
CNN B-ORG

said O
. O

The O
climate O
crisis O
is O
ultimately O
intensifying O
the O
water O
cycle O
, O
not O
only O
making O
dry O
periods O
drier O
and O
wet O
periods O
wetter O
. O

All O
this O
, O
Tellman B-PER
said O
, O
is O
another O
reason O
why O
policymakers O
need O
to O
put O
more O
focus O
on O
adaptation O
– O
helping O
communities O
adapt O
to O
the O

and O
grow O
more O

against O

. O

Passing O
a O
climate O
bill O
and O
moving O
forward O
politically O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
is O
really O
important O
and O
linked O
to O
preventing O

trying O
to O
reduce O
the O
amount O

Prosecutors O
alleged O
that O
Taherzadeh B-PER

One O

who O
Taherzadeh B-PER
offered O

on O
the O

according O
to O

Using O
fictitious O
individuals O

Taherzadeh B-PER
would O
tell O
the O

buildings O

the O

the O

adding O
that O
it O

“ O
something O

Friesen B-PER

The O
co-hosts O
have O
been O
covering O
Jones B-PER
since O
2017 O
, O
watching O
his O
transformation O
from O
a O
seemingly O
untouchable O
figure O
to O
one O
that O
is O
now O
in O
serious O
legal O
and O
financial O
jeopardy O
. O

During O
this O
whole O
stretch O
of O
time O
, O
his O
content O
itself O
has O
been O
essentially O
hollow O
, O
” O
Friesen B-PER
said O
. O

Watching O
him O
from O
my O
perspective O
has O
gotten O
a O
lot O
less O
interesting O
. O

But O
despite O
Jones B-PER
’ O
legal O
woes O
, O
Holmes B-PER
said O
that O
the O
culture O
he’s O
helped O
engender O
has O
gotten O
a O
lot O
bigger O
. O

Conspiracy O
culture O
is O
something O
that O
is O
created O
through O
the O
cracks O
of O
our O
regular O
society O
,” O
Holmes B-PER
said O
. O

And O
although O
their O
podcast O
focuses O
on O
scrutinizing O
Jones B-PER
and O
his O
tactics O
, O
Holmes B-PER
said O
the O
trial O
was O
really O
about O
the O
victims O
. O

People O
would O
like O
to O
focus O
on O
Alex B-PER
being O
kind O
of O
a O
bombastic O
character O
that O
we O
can O
mock O
and O
make O
fun O
of O
, O
but O
this O
isn’t O
about O
him O
, O
” O
Holmes B-PER
said O
. O

The O
podcast O
format O
allows O
the O
hosts O
to O
go O
beyond O
Jones B-PER
as O
a O
character O
and O
dive O
into O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
what O
he’s O
doing O
and O
why O
these O
conspiracy O
narratives O
exist O

We O
approach O
it O
with O
the O
understanding O
that O
it’s O
a O
serious O
topic O
,” O
Friesen B-PER
said O
. O

But O
also O
that O
in O
order O
to O
make O
it O
interesting O
for O
anybody O
to O
listen O
to O
, O
we O
have O
to O
make O
it O
make O
something O
entertaining O
. O

Friesen B-PER
has O
listened O
to O
countless O
hours O
of O
Jones’ B-PER
program O
, O
and O
calls O
it O
an O
“incredibly O
boring O
experience O
. O
” O

The O
reason O
that O
I O
do O
this O
is O
because O
I O
can O
stomach O
that O
boredom,” O
Friesen B-PER
said. O

He O
endures O
the O
task O
in O
order O
to O
help O
others O
get O
insights O
into O
the O
misinformation O
phenomenon O
. O

So O
they O
could O
be O
in O
a O
place O
where O
they O
could O
better O
understand O
what O
Alex B-PER
is O
doing O
and O
what O
he O
brings O
to O
the O
table O
.” O

Many O
hope O
that O
the O
legal O
and O
financial O
jeopardy O
Jones’ O
is O
now O
facing O
will O
help O
curtail O
misinformation O
and O
conspiracy O
culture O

But O
Friesen B-PER
isn’t O
convinced O
it O
will O
be O
a O
severe O
blow O

The O
conspiracy O
producers O
and O
people O
who O
engage O
in O
the O
sorts O
of O
conduct O
that O
Alex B-PER
does O
end O
up O
becoming O
a O
little O
bit O
savvier O
, O
” O
Friesen B-PER

They O
end O
up O

Rudolph B-PER

the O
stand O
in O
his O
own O
defense O
at O
a O
federal O
trial O
in B-LOC
Denver I-LOC
last O
week O

The O
Phoenix B-LOC

shared O
a O
passion O
for O
big-game O
hunting O
, O
and O
had O
traveled O
to O
the O
southern O
African B-LOC
nation O
of O
Zambia B-LOC
in O
September O
2016 O
so O
Bianca B-PER
Rudolph I-PER
could O
add O
a O
leopard O
to O
her O
collection O
of O
animal O
trophies O
. O

They O
carried O
two O
guns O
for O
the O
hunt O
: O
a O
Remington O
.375 O
rifle O
and O
a O
Browning O
12-gauge O

Two O
weeks O
later O
, O
as O
Bianca B-PER
Rudolph I-PER
was O
packing O
for O
the O

return O
home O
, O
she O
suffered O
a O
fatal O
blast O
from O
the O
Browning O
shotgun O
in O
their O
hunting O
cabin O
at O
Kafue B-LOC
National I-LOC

Rudolph O
told O
investigators O
he O
heard O
the O
shot O
at O
dawn O
while O
he O
was O
in O
the O
bathroom O
and O
believed O
the O
shotgun O
accidentally O
went O
off O
as O
she O
was O
putting O
it O
in O
its O
case O
, O

He O
told O

he O
found O
her O
bleeding O

But O
federal O
prosecutors O
at O
Rudolph’s B-PER
trial O
in O
Denver B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
insurance O
companies O
are O
based O
, O
described O
it O
as O
a O
premeditated O
crime O
. O

Prosecutors O
argued O
Rudolph B-PER
killed O
his O

30 O
years O

to O
be O
with O
his O

Lori B-PER

kill O
his O

that O
Rudolph B-PER
owns O
a O
dental O

at O
$ O
10 O
million O

The O

found O

that O

As O
a O

the O

, O
he O
was O
“livid,” O
Peterson B-PER

Rudolph B-PER
initially O
told O

his O

but O
an O
investigation O
by O

it O
an O

complaint O

At O

there O
is O

It O
would O

if O

by O
an O
outside O
independent O

that O
the O

confidence O

I O
would O
say O
that O
DPS B-ORG
was O
fast O
to O
wash O
its O
hands O
, O
to O
point O
fingers O
and O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
general O

knew O
that O
they O
were O
spotless O
, O
blameless O

that O
this O
was O
a O
local O
problem O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O

The O
new O
reporting O
comes O
more O
than O
two O
months O
after O
an O
18-year-old O
gunman O
entered O
the O
school O
, O
opened O
fire O
inside O
two O
adjoining O
classrooms O
and O
slaughtered O
19 O
children O

two O

Officers O
arrived O
on O
the O
scene O
minutes O
later O
, O
but O
after O
taking O
fire O
from O
the O
gunman O
, O
they O
retreated O
to O
a O
hallway O

and O
the O
gunman O
remained O
inside O
the O

for O
a O
total O
of O
77 O
minutes O
before O
a O
tactical O
unit O
forced O
their O

in O

killed O
him O
, O
according O
to O
a O
timeline O
from O

The O
long O

contradicts O
a O
widely O

, O
which O
says O
that O

stop O
the O

as O
fast O
as O
possible O

new O
proposed O
requirements O
from O
the O

agency O

NASA B-ORG
posted O
a O
public O
notice O
online O
on O
Tuesday O
that O
laid O
out O
a O
handful O
of O
updated O
requirements O
for O
future O
private O
astronaut O
missions O
, O
which O
the O
agency O
said O
are O
based O
on O
lessons O
learned O
upon O
completion O
of O
the O
first O
private O
astronaut O
mission O
to O
the O
ISS O
that O
took O
place O
last O
April O
. O

The O
first O
all-private O
mission O
to O
the O
orbiting O
laboratory O
was O
a O
multi-million O
dollar O
journey O
organized O
by O
Texas-based O
startup O
Axiom B-ORG
Space I-ORG
and O
launched O
via O
a O
SpaceX B-ORG
rocket O
, O
with O
a O
crew O
comprised O
of O
a O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
and O
current O
Axiom B-ORG
Space I-ORG
employee O
, O
Michael B-PER
López-Alegría I-PER
, O
and O
three O
ultra-wealthy O
paying O
crewmembers O
. O

During O
the O
mission O
, O
dubbed O
AX-1 O
, O
the O
four-member O
crew O
spent O
nearly O
two O
weeks O
off O
of O
Earth’s B-LOC
surface O
, O
at O
least O
in O
part O
conducting O
experiments O
and O
other O
scientific O
work O
. O

Other O
space O
tourism O
companies O
like O
Blue B-ORG
Origin I-ORG
or O
Virgin B-ORG
Galactic I-ORG
only O
offer O
customers O
short O
trips O
that O
allow O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
microgravity O

Among O
the O
most O
notable O
new O
policies O
for O
these O
pricey O
, O
private O
missions O
to O
the O
ISS O
is O
that O
“ O
upcoming O
private O
astronaut O
missions O
include O
a O
former O
flown O
NASA B-ORG
( O
U.S. O
) O
government O
astronaut O
as O
the O
mission O
commander O
, O
according O
to O
the O
NASA B-ORG
update O
.” O

The O
requirement O
is O
still O
being O
finalized O
, O
NASA B-ORG
added O
, O
but O
the O
agency O
noted O
that O
having O
a O
former O
, O
legitimate O
astronaut O
“ O
provides O
experienced O
guidance O
for O
the O
private O
astronauts O
during O
pre-flight O
preparation O
through O
mission O
execution O
.” O

The O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
also O
“provides O
a O
link” O
between O
residents O
on O
the O
ISS B-ORG
and O
the O
private O
astronauts O
, O
which O
the O
agency O
said O
“reduces O
risk” O
to O
ISS B-ORG
operations O
and O
safety. O

Late O
last O
year O
, O
SpaceX B-ORG
launched O
the O
Inspiration4 B-ORG
mission O
, O
which O
was O
bankrolled O
by O
billionaire O
Jared B-PER
Isaacman I-PER
and O
had O
a O
four-person O
crew O
composed O
entirely O
of O
people O
without O
any O
prior O
spaceflight O
experience O
. O

This O
private O
mission O
, O
however O
, O
simply O
took O
a O
three-day O
spin O
around O
Earth B-LOC
in O
a O
SpaceX B-ORG
dragon O
capsule O
and O
did O
not O
dock O
at O
the O
ISS O
. O

Axiom B-ORG
has O
already O
stated O
that O
its O
second O
private O
astronaut O
mission O
to O
the O
ISS O
, O
dubbed O
AX-2 O
and O
expected O
to O
launch O
next O
year O
, O
will O
have O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
Peggy B-PER
Whitson I-PER
as O
a O
mission O
commander O

International B-ORG

last O
week O
, O
López-Alegría B-PER
spoke O
about O
how O
he O
became O
mission O
commander O
for O
the O
AX-1 O
flight O
, O
saying O
he O
initially O
didn’t O
expect O
to O
return O
to O
space O
after O
retiring O
from O
NASA B-ORG
. O

When O
Axiom B-ORG
was O
looking O
for O
customers O
, O
however O
, O
“ O
It O
became O
pretty O
clear O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
that O
customers O
really O
didn’t O
want O
to O
fly O
with O
nobody O
who’d O
done O
it O
before O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O

It O
also O
became O
apparent O
, O
he O
said O
, O
“ O
NASA B-ORG
was O
a O
lot O
more O
comfortable O
having O
someone O
who’d O
been O
there O
before O

what O
can O
you O

when O
your O

he O
took O
a O
moment O

Because O
these O

it O

They O
deserve O
to O
have O
what O
they O
had O
before O

Fleming-Neon B-LOC

nearly O

admitted O
the O

The O

started O
to O
rise O
quickly O
as O

pulled O
up O

him O
inside O
his O

he O

His O
only O

the O

into O
an O
old O

had O
left O

“ O
I O

he O

Diving O
out O
the O

, O
he O
made O
it O
to O

by O
climbing O
on O
top O
of O
the O

where O
he O
remained O
for O
15 O
hours O
as O

downed O

rushed O
past O
him O

“ O

I O
found O

along O

had O
more O

it O

It’s O
like O
someone O

sat O

out O

he O
worries O

this O

more O

2.9 O

whose O
visit O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
was O
the O
first O
of O
its O
kind O
in O
25 O

, O
said O
she O

“not O

She O
thanked O

the O

they O

Sixteen O
of O
the O

in O
Kentucky B-LOC

in O
Knott B-LOC
County I-LOC

according O
to O
the O

Seven O

two O

These O

per O

from O

The O
reality O
is O
that O
when O
creeks O
get O
up O
and O
out O
of O
their O
banks O
, O
they O
almost O
always O
find O
the O
folks O
who O
are O
already O
living O
closer O
to O
the O
margins O
, O
whether O
these O
are O
people O
in O

or O
mobile O
homes O
or O
people O
in O
homes O
that O
are O
well O
within O
the O
floodplain O
, O
” O
Arndt B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

We O
saw O
it O
in O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
last O
week O

We O
saw O
it O
in O
my O
home O
region O
of O
western O
North B-LOC
Carolina I-LOC
last O
summer O
. O

It’s O
an O
unrelenting O
theme O
, O
experts O
say O
: O
Flash O
floods O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
punch O
hard O
on O
already O
vulnerable O
communities O
. O

To O
help O
protect O
against O
climate-related O
hazards O
, O
we O
must O
think O
about O
disaster O
mitigation O
not O
as O
a O
short-term O
goal O
– O
but O
rather O
as O
a O
long-term O
one O
. O

Growth O
pushes O
vulnerable O
groups O
to O
the O
margins O
There O
are O
a O
few O
reasons O
why O
the O
climate O
crisis O
afflicts O
some O
communities O
more O
than O
others O
, O
said O
Samantha B-PER
Montano I-PER
, O
an O
assistant O
professor O
of O
emergency O
management O
at O
Massachusetts B-ORG
Maritime I-ORG
Academy I-ORG
and O
the O
author O
of O
the O
2021 O
book O
“Disasterology: O
Dispatches O
from O
the O
Frontlines O
of O
the O
Climate O
Crisis.” O

For O
one O
, O
over O
the O
course O
of O
many O
decades O
, O
low-income O
communities O
and O
communities O
of O
color O
have O
been O
built O
in O
locations O
that O
are O
more O
physically O
vulnerable O
to O
extreme O
weather O
events O
. O

As O
a O
city O
expands O
, O
certain O
groups O
are O
usually O
pushed O
into O
marshlands O
or O
bayous O
or O
other O
high-risk O
areas O
, O
” O
Montano B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

Infrastructure O
also O
plays O
a O
role O

Low-income O
communities O
tend O
to O
receive O
far O
less O
investment O
in O
their O
infrastructure O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
becomes O
more O
vulnerable O
. O

So, O
when O
there O
is O
a O
rainstorm O
or O
another O
hazard O
happens, O
the O
infrastructure O
isn’t O
able O
to O
withstand O
those O
impacts O
like O
the O
more O
up-to-date O
infrastructure O
in O
a O
wealthier O
community O
can,” O
Montano B-PER
continued. O

Other O
social O
vulnerability O
issues O
matter O
, O
too O
. O

Wealthier O
people O
have O
the O
money O
to O
construct O
their O
homes O
using O
higher-standard O
building O
materials O
and O
building O
codes O

Further, O
wealthier O
people O
have O
more O
money O
to O
spend O
on O
mitigating O
hazards. O

Think O
of O
the O
infamous O
example O
of O
celebrities O
in O
California B-LOC
hiring O
private O
firefighters O
,” O
Montano B-PER
said O
. O

They’re O
better O
able O
to O
protect O
themselves O
when O
these O
hazards O
happen O
. O

Njoki B-PER
Mwarumba I-PER

assistant O
professor O
of O
emergency O
management O
and O
disaster O
preparedness O
at O
the O
University B-ORG
of O
Nebraska B-LOC
Omaha I-LOC
, O
echoed O
some O
of O
Montano’s O
sentiments O
. O

One O
thing O
that’s O
consistently O
misunderstood O
and O
that O
doesn’t O
receive O
the O
attention O
it O
needs O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
don’t O
wake O
up O
and O
decide O
to O
be O
vulnerable O
,” O
Mwarumba B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O

Often O
, O
when O
we O
try O
to O
address O
people O
in O
their O
communities O
from O
a O
point O
of O
vulnerability O
, O
we O
miss O
the O
systems O
that O
made O
that O
vulnerability O
. O

Miseducation O
, O
historical O
trauma O
in O
Native B-LOC
American I-LOC
and O
Black B-LOC
American I-LOC
communities O
, O
marginalization O
and O
disinvestment O
: O
Many O
variables O
compound O
to O
create O
vulnerability O
. O

What O
ought O
to O
happen O
next O
. O

Mwarumba B-PER
explained O
that O
we O
should O
direct O
more O
of O
our O
attention O
– O
our O
knowledge O
, O
our O
data O
– O
toward O
addressing O
some O
of O
these O
root O
causes O
of O
unsafe O
conditions O
. O

This O
is O
important O
, O
because O
during O
recovery O
, O
you O
want O
to O
think O
about O
not O
only O
the O
immediate O
response O
but O
also O
long-term O
mitigation O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O

In O
the O
aftermath O
of O
a O
disaster O
, O
people O
frequently O
say O
that O
they O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
“normal.” O

That O
impulse O
is O
understandable O
, O
but O
people O
shouldn’t O
strive O
to O
return O
to O
normal O
, O
because O
normal O
was O
the O
problem O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

You O
want O
to O
rethink O
your O
building O
needs O
,” O
Mwarumba B-PER
said O
. O
“ O

Because O
if O
you’re O
trying O
to O
quickly O
get O
back O
to O
normal O
, O
what O
that O
means O
is O
that O
you’re O
predisposing O
yourself O
to O
another O
event O
. O

And O
that O
event O
is O
actually O
going O
to O
be O
compounded O
, O
because O
you’re O
going O
to O
be O
dealing O
with O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
event O
you’re O
currently O
going O
through O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
disasters O
are O
very O
comprehensive O
, O
as O
CNN’s B-ORG
Rachel B-PER
Ramirez I-PER
recently O
stressed O
, O
and O
it’s O
vital O
to O
consider O
what O
recovery O
and O
preparedness O
mean O
beyond O
just O
the O
present O
moment O
. O

Montano B-PER
pointed O
out O
the O
significance O
of O
full O
, O
vigorous O
media O
coverage O
. O

These O
disasters O
aren’t O
one-off O
events O

The O
problems O
we O
see O
in O
Kentucky B-LOC
are O
going O
to O
look O
remarkably O
similar O
to O
the O
problems O
we O
see O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
Missouri B-LOC
and O
anywhere O
else O
affected O
by O
a O
disaster O
,” O
she O
said O
. O

This O
is O
important O
for O
the O
public O
to O
understand O
, O
because O
when O
you O
see O
problems O
come O
up O
again O
and O
again O
, O
that O
means O
these O
are O
systemic O
problems O
. O

Sustaining O
media O
coverage O
matters O
, O
too O
. O
“ O

The O
reporting O
on O
Kentucky B-LOC
is O
going O
to O
drop O
off O
in O
a O
few O
days O
, O
but O
in O
some O
ways O
, O
that’s O
when O
the O
disaster O
is O
really O
just O
beginning O
, O
” O
Montano B-PER
said O
. O

The O
recovery O
from O
the O
flooding O
is O
going O
to O
be O
long O
and O
difficult O

It’s O
crucial O
that O
media O
outlets O
continue O
to O
cover O
what’s O
happening O
and O
hold O
governments O
accountable O

Indeed O
, O
what O
governments O
choose O
to O
do O
, O
or O
refuse O
to O
do O
, O
after O
a O
disaster O
matters O
greatly O
, O
and O
can O
have O
tremendous O
consequences O
for O
the O
people O
at O
the O
center O
of O
an O
extreme O
weather O
event O
. O

We O
often O
frame O
climate O
change O
as O
a O
science O
issue O
or O
a O
technology O
issue O
or O
an O
energy O
issue O
or O
a O
politics O
issue O
,” O
Arndt B-PER
said O
, O
“ O
but O
it’s O
ultimately O
an O
anthropological O
issue O
.” O

Put O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
bluntly O
: O
Which O
lives O
do O
we O
value O
? O

And O
which O
do O
we O
put O
in O
harm’s O
way O

time O
Thursday O

as O
a O

in O
Russia’s B-LOC

fined O
Griner O
1 O
million O
rubles O
, O
or O
about O
$ O
16,400 O
. O

She O
said O
the O
court O
took O
into O
account O
Griner’s O
partial O
admission O
of O
guilt O
, O
remorse O
for O
the O
deed O
, O
state O
of O
health O
and O

Prosecutors O
had O
asked O
that O
she O
be O
sentenced O
to O
9.5 O
years O
in O
jail O

Prior O
to O
the O
verdict O
, O
Griner O
apologized O
to O
the O
court O
and O
asked O
for O
leniency O
in O
an O
emotional O
speech O
. O

I O
never O
meant O
to O
hurt O
anybody O
, O
I O
never O
meant O
to O
put O
in O
jeopardy O
the O
Russian B-LOC
population O
, O
I O
never O
meant O
to O
break O
any O
laws O
here O
, O
Griner B-PER
said O
. O

I O
made O
an O
honest O
mistake O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
in O
your O
ruling O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
end O
my O
life O
here O

I O
know O
everybody O
keeps O
talking O
about O
political O
pawn O
and O
politics O
, O
but O
I O
hope O
that O
, O
that O
is O
far O
from O
this O
courtroom O
. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
again O
that O
I O
had O
no O
intent O
on O
breaking O
any O
Russian B-LOC
laws O
. O

I O
had O
no O
intent O

I O
did O
not O
conspire O
or O
plan O
to O
commit O
this O
crime,” O
she O
added. O

After O
the O
sentence O
, O
Griner O
told O
a O
CNN B-ORG
producer O
as O
she O
left O
court O
, O
“ O
I O
love O
my O
family O
.” O

The O

about O
six O
months O

the O
31-year-old O
was O
arrested O
at O
a O
Moscow B-LOC
airport O
and O
accused O
by O
Russian B-LOC
prosecutors O
of O
trying O
to O
smuggle O
less O

1 O

said O
in O
a O
written O
statement O

will O
appeal O
the O

criticized O
the O
court O
for O
ignoring O
their O

They O
have O
10 O
days O
to O
appeal O
. O
“ O

We O
are O
very O
disappointed O
by O
the O

As O
legal O
professionals O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
court O
should O
be O
fair O
to O
everyone O
regardless O
of O
nationality O
. O

The O
court O
completely O
ignored O
all O
the O
evidence O
of O
the O
defense O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
the O
guilty O
plea O
, O
” O
they O
said O
in O
the O
statement O
. O

This O
contradicts O
the O
existing O
legal O
practice O
. O

Taking O
into O
account O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
substance O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
defects O
of O
the O
expertise O

and O
the O
plea O
, O
the O
verdict O
is O
absolutely O
unreasonable O

We O
will O
certainly O
file O
an O
appeal O

Speaking O
outside O

Boykov B-PER
said O
that O

the O

call O

the O
