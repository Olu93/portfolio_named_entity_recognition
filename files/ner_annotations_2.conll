We O
work O

she O

so O
much O
in O

She’s O
formed O
quite O
a O
bit O

worked O
on O
it O
very O
hard O

And O
with O
that O
, O
she’s O
brought O

Manchin B-PER

I O

the O
whole O

what O
we’re O
doing O
… O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
positive O
about O
it O

she’ll O
make O
her O
decision O

I O
respect O
that O

” O
Manchin B-PER

Can’t O
they O
pay O

so O
that O
we O

move O
forward O

be O
the O
leader O

the O

that O

That O
analysis O
, O
however O
, O
looked O
at O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
the O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
provision O
on O
corporations O
. O

Economists O
assume O
companies O
would O
then O
pass O
along O
part O

tax O
increase O
to O
employees O
by O
reducing O
their O
after-tax O
wages O

job O

Manchin B-PER
said O

hopes O
the O

which O
is O
what O
Democratic B-MISC

is O
hoping O
for O

The O

support O
is O
notable O
given O
his O

earlier O

“ O
unequivocally O

wouldn’t O
support O
the O

economic O
package O

which O
appeared O
to O
torpedo O
any O

passing O

to O
fight O

in O
the O

right O

– O
reinforce O
a O
fundamental O
fact O
of O
Trump’s B-PER
situation O
: O
He O
is O
far O
more O
likely O
to O
see O
a O
2024 B-MISC
run O

curtailed O
by O
legal O
problems O
than O
political O
ones O

Politically O
, O
Trump B-PER
remains O
the O
800-pound O
gorilla O
in O

And, O
he O
has O
all O

announced O
his O
intention O

run O
again, O
with O
the O
major O
question O
at O
this O
point O
being O
when O
he O
will O
announce O
his O
candidacy O
– O
not O
whether O
he O
will O
do O
so. O
Trump B-PER
posted O
a O
campaign-style O

saying O
“the O

Trump’s B-PER
mounting O

– O
or O
at O

the O
clear O
sense O
that O
this O

getting O
closer O

closer O

him O

complicate O
all O

Trump B-PER

one O
thing O

something O

We O
are O
, O
of O
course O
, O
not O
there O
yet O
. O
But O
, O
Monday’s O
FBI B-ORG
activity O
suggests O
that O
Trump’s B-PER
legal O
problems O
are O
likely O
to O
get O
worse O
before O

lost O

more O

in O
an O

she O
offered O

I O

talked O

this O
at O
length O

about O
the O
2020 O
election O

” O
Dixon B-PER
said O

“ O
It O
was O
unlike O
any O

we O
had O

in O

were O
some O

happen O
in O

are O
very O

quickly O
slammed O
her O
for O
appearing O
to O
water O
down O
her O
views O
on O
the O

Garrett B-PER
Soldano I-PER
, O
a O
chiropractor O
vying O
for O
the O
GOP B-ORG
nomination O
, O
panned O
Dixon B-PER
for O
dodging O
the O
2020 O
election O
question O
and O
doubled O
down O
on O
his O
support O
for O
the O
former O
President O

“ O
The O
election O
, O
in O
my O
humble O
opinion O

stolen O

he O
said O
in O
an O

“ O
I O
’m O
not O
even O
endorsed O
by O
President O
Trump B-PER
, O
and O
I O
still O
have O
his O
back O

Soldano B-PER
then O
turned O
his O
stare O
straight O
down O
the O
lens O
of O
a O
CNN B-ORG
camera O
, O
seemingly O
hoping O
to O
address O
Trump B-PER
directly O
. O
“ O
Even O
though O
, O
sir O
, O
you O
didn’t O

Soldano B-PER
said O
. O
Businessman-turned-candidate O
Kevin B-PER
Rinke I-PER
also O
bashed O
Dixon B-PER
for O
dancing O
around O
election O
falsehoods O
. O
“ O
She O
got O
an O
endorsement O

within O
48 O
hours O
when O
she O
was O
asked O
on O
national O
TV O
if O
the O

was O
stolen O
, O
she O
changed O
her O
mind O
, O
” O
Rinke B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
That O
's O
what O
politicians O
do O
. O
Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
is O
the O
Republican O
version O
of O
Gretchen B-PER
Whitmer I-PER
– O
‘ O
I O
’ll O
say O

I O
’ll O

, O
he O
said O
referring O
to O
the O
state O

Democratic O

. O
Rinke B-PER
didn’t O
go O
so O
far O
as O
to O
claim O
the O
election O
was O
stolen O
and O
acknowledged O
that O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
is O
the O
President O
. O

Still, O
he O
said O
he O
believes O
there O
were O
“irregularities” O
in O
2020. O
Meantime, O
Ryan B-PER
Kelley, I-PER
a O
real O

broker O
in O
the O

has O
essentially O
turned O
his O
arrest O
for O
allegedly O
participating O
in O
the O
Capitol B-LOC
riot O
into O
a O
campaign O
rallying O
cry. O
“Look O
how O
hard O
these O
people O
are O
trying O
to O
silence O
me,” O
Kelley B-PER
said O
in O
a O
July B-MISC
GOP B-ORG
primary O
debate. O

I O
got O
arrested O

I O
got O
kicked O
off O

He O
has O
pleaded O
not O
guilty O
to O
the O
misdemeanor O
charges O
he O
faces O
and O
has O
continued O
to O
falsely O
claim O
Trump B-PER
won O
in O
2020 O
. O
Republican B-ORG
activists O
here O
have O
rallied O
behind O
Trump-loving O
, O
election-denying O
candidates O
. O

At O
an O
endorsement O
convention O
earlier O
this O
year O
, O
Republicans B-ORG
backed O
Kristina B-PER
Karamo I-PER
for O
secretary O
of O

Matthew B-PER
DePerno I-PER
for O
attorney O
general O
, O
paving O
their O
path O
for O
official O

later O
this O

If O
they O
win O
in O
November B-MISC
, O
they O
would O
be O
in O
key O
positions O
to O
oversee O
the O
state’s O
elections O
. O

But O
the O
prospect O
of O
having O
Dixon B-PER
atop O
the O
ticket O
has O
rankled O
some O
Trump B-PER
supporters O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
her O
less-than-enthusiastic O
embrace O
of O
the O
election O
falsehoods O
fueling O
the O
base O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
she’s O
given O
lip O
service O
to O
President O

his O
supporters O
on O
those O
issues O
but O
only O
when O
truly O
pushed O
, O
” O
GOP B-ORG
political O
strategist O
John B-PER
Yob I-PER
said O
in O
an O
interview O
. O
“ O
President O
Trump B-PER
still O
is O
very O
popular O
with O
conservative O
voters O
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
his O
endorsement O
will O
definitely O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
this O
race O
, O
” O
Yob B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
However O
, O
it O
also O
puts O
things O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
precarious O
situation O
with O
some O
of O
his O
supporters O
being O
left O
dazed O

confused O
because O
they’ve O
been O
behind O
other O

more O
MAGA-centric O

candidates O

now O
all O
of O
a O

he’s O

The O

doesn’t O
share O
the O
concern O
that O
Dixon B-PER
may O
not O
be O
as O
vocal O
on O
election O
issues O
, O
said O
a O
person O
close O
to O
Trump B-PER

Dixon B-PER
has O
largely O
shrugged O
off O
the O
criticism O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
that’s O
interesting O

” O
she O
said O
of O
the O

barbs O
from O
her O
GOP B-ORG
opponents O

“ O
because O
my O

a O

I O
guess O
it’s O
just O
a O
campaign O

Dixon B-PER
said O
she O
believed O
she O
could O
get O
a O
boost O
from O
the O

declined O

whether O

back O
him O

China’s B-LOC
threat O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
is O
“more O
serious O
than O
ever,” O
but O
the O
island O
will O
stand O
firm O
to O
protect O
its O
freedom O
and O
democracy O
– O
including O
by O
welcoming O
those O
who O
support O
it, O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
Foreign O
Minister O
Joseph B-PER
Wu I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
in O
an O
interview O
Monday. O
Wu’s B-PER
defiant O
message O
came O
as O
China B-LOC
said O
it O
continued O
military O
drills O
around O
the O
self-governing O
island, O
after O
a O
four-day O
show O
of O
force O
following O
US B-ORG
House O
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi’s I-PER
trip O
to O
Taipei B-LOC
last O
week. O
“China B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
threatening O
Taiwan B-LOC
for O
years O
and O
it’s O
getting O
more O
serious O
in O
the O
last O
few O
years,” O
Wu B-PER
said. O
“Whether O
Speaker O
Pelosi B-PER
visits O
Taiwan B-LOC
or O
not, O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
military O
threat O
against O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
always O
been O
there O
and O
that O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
need O
to O
deal O
with.” O
Welcoming O
overseas O
friends O
to O
the O
island O
was O
a O
key O
part O
of O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
strategy O
to O
counter O
China’s B-LOC
attempts O
to O
isolate O
it O
from O
the O
international O
community O
– O
regardless O
of O
the O
potential O
backlash O
from O
Beijing, B-LOC
Wu B-PER
said. O
“(China) B-LOC
cannot O
dictate O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
we O
should O
not O
welcome O
anyone O
who O
likes O
to O
come O
and O
show O
support O
for O
Taiwan,” O
said O
Wu, B-PER
who O
has O
served O
as O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
foreign O
minister O
since O
2018. O
Pelosi’s B-PER
Taiwan B-LOC
trip O
– O
the O
first O
by O
a O
sitting O
House O
Speaker O
to O
the O
island O
in O
25 O
years O
– O
was O
vehemently O
opposed O
by O
China’s B-LOC
ruling O
Communist O
Party, O
which O
views O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
its O
territory O
despite O
never O
having O
controlled O
it. O
In O
the O
wake O
of O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit, O
Beijing B-LOC
has O
ramped O
up O
pressure O
on O
Taiwan, B-LOC
including O
via O
economic O
penalties, O
the O
launch O
of O
missiles O
over O
the O
island O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
and O
drills O
that O
Taipei B-LOC
has O
said O
were O
meant O
to O
“simulate” O
an O
attack O
against O
its O
main O
island O
and O
navy. O
Though O
those O
exercises O
were O
originally O
expected O
to O
end O
Sunday, O
drills O
around O
Taiwan B-LOC
continued O
Monday, O
according O
to O
an O
announcement O
from O
China’s B-LOC
military. O
But O
as O
the O
live-fire O
drills O
raised O
global O
fears O
of O
a O
possible O
military O
conflict, O
the O
mood O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
remained O
calm, O
with O
life O
carrying O
on O
as O
usual O
with O
packed O
restaurants O
and O
crowded O
public O
transport. O
For O
Wu, B-PER
the O
threat O
made O
it O
even O
more O
critical O
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
continue O
to O
build O
its O
international O
relationships O
and O
show O
it O
is O
not O
afraid. O

I O
worry O
that O
China B-LOC
may O
really O
launch O
a O
war O
against O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
But O
what O
it O
is O
doing O
right O
now O
is O
trying O
to O
scare O
us O
and O
the O
best O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
( O
is O
) O
to O
show O
to O
China B-LOC
that O
we O
are O
not O
scared O
.” O
Pelosi B-PER
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
Though O
her O
trip O
was O
long O
mooted O
and O
much O
discussed O
, O
Taiwanese B-MISC
officials O
only O
received O
short O
notice O
of O
her O
arrival O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Since O
her O
travel O
is O
always O
subject O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
considerations O
, O
especially O
security O
considerations O
… O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
out O
until O
the O
very O
last O
moment O
when O
she O
firmed O
up O
her O
plan O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
, O
adding O
Taipei B-LOC
knew O
the O
itinerary O
a O
few O
days O
beforehand O
, O
but O
not O
the O
exact O
timing O
of O
her O
arrival O
. O
The O
visit O
from O
the O
speaker O
and O
an O
accompanying O
congressional O
delegation O
included O
meetings O
at O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
legislature O
and O
the O
office O
of O
Taiwanese B-MISC
President O
Tsai B-PER
Ing-wen I-PER
, O
where O
Pelosi B-PER
said O
they O
came O
to O
send O
an O
“ O
unequivocal O
message O
” O
that O
“ O
America B-LOC
stands O
with O
Taiwan B-LOC
.” O
Wu B-PER
said O
his O
most O
memorable O
impression O
of O
the O
trip O
was O
greeting O
Pelosi B-PER
and O
the O
delegation O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
where O
she O
“ O
showed O
her O
charm O
” O
by O
saying O
she’d O
been O
looking O
forward O
to O
her O
visit O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
“ O
And O
by O
the O
time O
she O
departed O
, O
she O
not O
only O
said O
goodbye O
to O
me O
, O
but O
also O
said O
goodbye O
to O
the O
ground O
crew O
, O
the O
security O
people O
, O
and O
to O
those O
people O
who O
had O
been O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
airport O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
” O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O
When O
asked O
whether O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
would O
increase O
its O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC
after O
the O
visit O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
the O
US B-ORG
has O
always O
been O
“ O
highly O
supportive O
” O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
– O
but O
the O
current O
support O
was O
“ O
unprecedented O
.” O
In O
an O
exclusive O
interview O
with O
CNN B-ORG
last O
October O
, O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
President O
Tsai B-PER
Ing-wen I-PER
confirmed O
some O
US B-ORG
military O
trainers O
were O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
– O
the O
first O
time O
a O
Taiwanese B-MISC
leader O
had O
admitted O
to O
their O
presence O
since O
Washington B-LOC
and O
Taipei B-LOC
severed O
diplomatic O
ties O
in O
1979 O
. O
But O
perceptions O
of O
American B-MISC
support O
sparked O
Beijing’s B-LOC
ire O
against O
the O
speaker’s O
visit O
, O
with O
China’s B-LOC
foreign O
ministry O
issuing O
a O
statement O
on O
the O
heels O
of O

evening O

would O
have O
a O
“ O
severe O
impact O

relations O
, O
” O
and O
“ O
gravely O

Beijing B-LOC
announced O
the O
large-scale O
military O
exercises O
in O
what O
it O
said O
were O
six O
zones O
around O
the O
island O
of O
Taiwan B-LOC
swiftly O
after O
Pelosi’s B-PER
arrival O
, O
in O
response O
to O
what O
it O
viewed O
as O
an O
infringement O
of O
China’s B-LOC
“ O
sovereignty O
and O
territorial O
integrity O
.” O
While O
the O
US B-ORG
and O
many O
of O
its O
allies O
have O
decried O
the O
drills O
, O
China B-LOC
defended O
its O
actions O
as O
“ O
legitimate O

and O
justified O
,” O
saying O
it O
was O
the O
US B-ORG
, O
not O
China B-LOC

who O
was O
“ O
the O
biggest O
saboteur O

where O

claims O
“ O

. O
‘Wrecking’ O
the O
status O

Taiwan B-LOC

been O
governed O
separately O
since O
the O

of O
a O
civil O

more O
than O
seven O
decades O
ago O
, O
in O
which O
the O
defeated O
Nationalists B-PER
fled O
to O
Taipei B-LOC
. O
Taiwan B-LOC
transitioned O
from O
authoritarian O
rule O
to O
a O
democracy O
in O
the O
1990s O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
as O
his O
power O
has O
grown O
, O
Chinese B-MISC
leader O
Xi B-PER
Jinping I-PER
has O
made O
clear O
his O
ambitions O
to O
“reunify” O
with O
the O
island O
– O
by O
force O
if O
necessary O
. O
Wu B-PER
accused O
China B-LOC
of O
trying O
to O
change O
the O
status O
quo O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
, O
including O
by O
conducting O
military O
exercises O
in O
recent O
days O
across O
the O
median O
line O
– O
the O
halfway O
point O
between O
the O

China B-LOC
that O
has O
previously O
been O
an O
informal O
but O
largely O
respected O
border O
of O
control O
between O
Beijing B-LOC

Dozens O
of O
Chinese B-MISC
warplanes O
crossed O
the O

between O
Thursday O
and O
Sunday O
, O
according O
to O
accounts O
from O
Taiwan’s B-LOC
Defense B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
. O
While O
the O
informal O
median O
line O
has O
largely O
preserved O
peace O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
for O
decades O
, O
China B-LOC
now O
openly O
denies O
its O
existence O
. O
“This O
kind O
of O
behavior O
is O
wrecking O
the O
status O

, O
and O
it’s O
wrecking O
peace O

in O
this O
region O
and O
it O
should O
not O
be O
accepted O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
, O
adding O
that O
China B-LOC
had O
sought O
to O
declare O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC
Strait I-LOC
as O
its O
internal O
waters O
for O
“some O
time” O
before O
Pelosi’s B-PER
visit O
. O
That O
had O
implications O
beyond O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
China B-LOC
seeks O
to O
expand O
its O
influence O
across O
the O
Western B-MISC
Pacific I-MISC
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
he O
remained O
optimistic O
about O
the O
future O

Democracy O
is O
going O
to O
prevail O
, O
he O
said O
. O
“ O
If O
you O
look O
at O
authoritarianism O
, O
it’s O
not O
resilient O
. O
” O

It O
may O
appear O
strong O
, O
and O
it O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
expanding O
. O

But O
it’s O
not O
resilient O
and O
at O
some O
point O
is O
going O
to O
break O
.” O
When O
asked O
if O
the O
situation O
could O
be O
called O
a O
crisis O
, O
Wu B-PER
said O
that O
was O
ultimately O
up O
to O
Beijing B-LOC
. O
“ O
It O
depends O
on O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Chinese B-MISC
leaders O

pursue O
the O

in O

” O
Wu B-PER
said O
he O
doesn’t O
know O
whether O

leaders O
“ O
have O
made O
up O
their O
mind O
” O
to O
use O
force O
to O
take O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
but O
Taiwanese B-MISC
officials O
were O
“ O
looking O
at O
several O
different O
scenarios O
, O
” O
in O
particular O
due O
to O
concerns O
that O
Beijing B-LOC
could O
seek O
to O
divert O
attention O
from O
domestic O
problems O
by O
creating O
a O
crisis O
in O
the O
Taiwan B-LOC

“ O
The O

that O

Democrats’ B-MISC
push O
to O
advance O
their O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
bill O
is O
likely O
headed O
for O
a O
procedural O
speed O
bump O
known O
in O
Washington B-LOC
as O
a O
“vote-a-rama.” O
The O
time-consuming O
and O
stamina-challenging O
process O
is O
among O
the O
final O
obstacles O
for O
Democrats, B-MISC
along O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian’s O
review O
of O
the O
package. O
Politically, O
a O
vote-a-rama O
gives O
Republicans B-ORG
a O
chance O
to O
sow O
discord O
and O
create O
distractions O
as O
they O
force O
Democrats B-MISC
to O
vote O
on O
controversial O
issues. O
But, O
once O
it’s O
over, O
Democrats B-MISC
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
advance O
their O
package O
on O
a O
straight O
party-line O
vote O
that O
would O
not O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
filibuster’s O
60-vote O
threshold. O
Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know: O
What O
is O
a O
vote-a-rama? O
Usually O
in O
the O
legislative O
process, O
lawmakers O
can O
use O
a O
series O
of O
procedural O
maneuvers O
to O
avoid O
voting O
on O
amendments. O
But O
in O
a O
budget O
reconciliation O
process O
– O
which O
Democrats B-MISC
are O
using O
to O
advance O
their O
bill O
– O
you O
can’t O
do O
that. O
Lawmakers O
cannot O
hold O
a O
final O
vote O
on O
a O
reconciliation O
bill O
until O
all O
the O
amendments O
have O
been O
“disposed O
of,” O
or O
in O
simpler O
terms, O
“voted O
on.” O
The O
practice O
involves O
votes O
on O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
that O
can O
– O
and O
usually O
do O
– O
stretch O
for O
hours. O
How O
do O
lawmakers O
use O
the O
process? O

The O
party O
in O
charge O
typically O
wants O
to O
move O
this O
vote-a-rama O
along O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
with O
as O
few O
votes O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
minority O
party O
takes O
the O
opportunity O
to O
force O
votes O
on O
all O
kinds O
of O
measures O
they O
don’t O
typically O
have O
the O
power O
to O
put O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
How O
long O
does O
each O
vote O
take O
? O

Usually O
, O
lawmakers O
agree O
to O
a O
process O
that O
looks O
a O
lot O
like O
this O
. O
Each O
amendment O
takes O
about O
15 O
minutes O
or O
so O
to O
get O
through O
. O
The O
process O
moves O
quickly O
by O
Senate B-ORG
standards O
, O
which O
is O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
for O
members O
to O
basically O
stay O
in O
or O
close O
by O
the O
chamber O
for O
the O
entire O
marathon O
event O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill O
? O

The O
bill O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ O
goals O
, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years O
: O
Still O
, O
this O
isn’t O
Build O
Back O
Better O
2.0 O
. O
The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O

And O
what O
does O
Maneskin O
mean O
? O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
It O
means O
moonlight O
I O
picked O
it O
when O
we O
first O
started O
playing O
because O
we O
needed O
to O
join O
this O
musical O
competition O
, O
and O
we O
didn’t O
have O
a O
name O
yet O
, O
so O
they O
just O
told O
me O
just O
say O
random O
words O
in O
Danish B-MISC
, O
and O
we O
chose O
one O
. O
Looking O
back O
at O
this O
last O
year O
, O
I’m O
sure O
it’s O
been O
absolutely O
crazy O
for O
you O
, O
from O
where O
you O
were O
a O
year O
ago O
to O
now O
? O
Damiano B-PER
David I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
it’s O
been O
a O
crazy O
journey O
, O
but O
of O
course O
we O
are O
really O
happy O
about O
everything O
that O
we O
did O
, O
and O
every O
time O
we O
look O
back O
, O
all O
the O
steps O
, O
we O
are O
super O
happy O
and O
proud O
. O
What O
has O
been O
the O
most O
surprising O
, O
maybe O
the O
most O
exciting O
thing O
, O
that O
has O
happened O
to O
you O
this O
past O
year O
? O

Raggi B-PER
: O
I O
think O
that O
we’ve O
had O
lots O
of O
incredible O
moments O
during O
this O
last O
year O
. O
Maybe O
a O
song O
with O
Iggy B-PER
Pop I-PER
is O
one O
of O
these O
, O
of O
course O
, O
and O
playing O
with O
The B-ORG
Stones I-ORG
. O

I O
mean O
a O
lot O
, O
it’s O
been O
a O
lot O
. O

Now O
you’re O
filling O
stadiums O
with O
70,000 O
people O
, O
selling O
out O
tickets O
for O
80,000 O
, O
and O
you’ve O
said O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
for O
you O
guys O
to O
even O
find O
a O
place O
to O
play O
in O
Italy B-LOC
. O
What O
was O
that O
like O
when O
you O
started O
: O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
It O
was O
very O
difficult O
because O
in O
Rome B-LOC
there’s O
no O
real O
rock O
scene O
, O
so O
there’s O
no O
like O
clubs O
wanting O
bands O
to O
play O
their O
stuff O
, O
and O
also O
people O
are O
not O
very O
used O
to O
going O
to O
gigs O
of O
upcoming O
artists O
. O
They O
just O
go O
to O
the O
famous O
ones O
that O
they O
already O
know O
, O
so O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
and O
that’s O
why O
we O
started O
playing O
as O
buskers O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

We O
were O
always O
fighting O
with O
the O
other O
street O
artists O
about O
having O
the O
best O
spot O
, O
and O
we O
never O
won O
, O
but O
… O
(laughter) O
. O
And O
then O
you O
do O
Eurovision B-MISC
, O
how O
did O
it O
change O
your O
life O
? O
David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
that O
was O
our O
first O
actual O
window O
outside O
of O
Italy B-LOC
. O
Since O
that O
moment O
we O
were O
only O
basing O
our O
projects O
for O
Italy B-LOC
and O
on O
Italy B-LOC
and O
that O
was O
the O
chance O
to O
break O
out O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
then O
from O
Europe B-LOC
to O
the O
US B-LOC
, O
and O
we O
hope O
to O
grow O
more O
and O
more O
. O
What O
was O
it O
like O
to O
win O
for O
Italy B-LOC
? O
It O
had O
been O
like O

years O
since O
Italy B-LOC
had O
won O
Eurovision B-MISC
, O
and O
then O
you O
win O
with O
rock O
n’ O
roll O
, O
a O
genre O
which O
is O
not O
very O
big O
there O
? O
Raggi B-PER
: O
Yes O
, O
that’s O
crazy O
. O

David B-PER
: O
That O
was O
unexpected O
I O
think O
for O
everybody O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
everyone O
was O
very O
proud O
, O
big O
celebration O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
times O
for O
Eurovision B-MISC
winners O
, O
they O
have O
that O
big O
moment O
and O
then O
they O
kind O
of O
disappear O
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
makes O
you O
guys O
different O
that O
you’ve O
been O
able O
to O
take O
this O
and O
catapult O
so O
much O
and O
become O
this O
worldwide O
phenomenon O
? O
David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
for O
us O
Eurovision B-MISC
came O
at O
a O
very O
right O
moment O
because O
we O
had O
just O
come O
out O
with O
an O
album O
, O
so O
what O
we O
brought O
to O
Eurovision B-MISC
was O
basically O
just O
one O
of O
the O
things O
of O
the O
whole O
album O
and O
it O
was O
fresh O
, O
and O
it O
was O
super O
authentic O
for O
us O
. O
So O
, O
I O
think O
that O
people O
were O
happy O
to O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
coherence O
between O
what O
we O
brought O
to O
Eurovision B-MISC
and O
what O
they O
saw O
in O
our O
catalogue O
, O
and O
they O
felt O
like O
, O
OK O
, O
this O
is O
not O
just O
a O
viral O
song O
that O
they O
made O
specifically O
for O
Eurovision B-MISC
, O
but O
it’s O
just O
one O
of O
their O
songs O
and O
then O
they O
have O
two O
albums O
, O
and O
it O
all O
makes O
sense O
. O
Then O
, O
you O
release O
“Beggin’ B-MISC
, O
” O
which O
turns O
into O
the O
most O
successful O
rock O
song O
of O
last O
year O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
woke O
up O
every O
morning O
I O
think O
for O
the O
last O
year O
like O
, O
(sings) O
, O
“I’m B-MISC
beggin’ I-MISC
, O
beggin’ I-MISC
you O
… O
(laughter) O
… O
It O
just O
gets O
in O
my O
head O
, O
and O
then O
I’m O
like O
, O
come O
on O
, O
just O
get O
out O
! O
David B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
it’s O
our O
fault O
, O
it’s O
our O
fault O
, O
(laughter) O

Well, O
it’s O
not O
even O
our O
fault O
because O
we O
didn’t O
even O
promote O
it. O
It’s O
TikTok’s B-ORG
fault. O
It O
just O
got O
viral. O
We O
were O
pretty O
shocked O
by O
it. O
When O
we O
saw O
it O
growing, O
we O
were O
like, O
what O
is O
happening, O
and O
then O
we O
found O
out O
it O
was O
viral O
on O
TikTok B-ORG
and O
all O
that O
came O
about O
after. O
Why O
that O
song? O

It’s O
a O
cover O
of O
Frankie B-PER
Valli I-PER
and O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
, O
and O
I O
can’t O
think O
of O
a O
more O
different O
style O
than O
you O
guys O
and O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Actually O
, O
we O
played O
it O
at O
first O
, O
when O
we O
just O
started O
, O
and O
we O
think O
it’s O
way O
more O
challenging O
and O
fun O
to O
make O
covers O
of O
very O
different O
songs O
. O
So O
, O
like O
now O
we’re O
also O
playing O
“ O
Womanizer B-PER
” O
by O
Britney B-PER
Spears I-PER
, O
for O
example O
, O
and O
we O
just O
find O
it O
a O
challenge O
and O
stimulating O
, O
and O
it O
really O
makes O
you O
do O
an O
interpretation O
of O
something O
different O
and O
bringing O
it O
into O
your O
own O
. O
That’s O
when O
you O
make O
something O
good O
, O
I O
think O
. O

You O
also O
covered O
“If O
I O
Can O
Dream” O
for O
the O
Elvis B-PER
movie, O
what O
was O
it O
like O
singing O
an O
Elvis B-PER
song? O
I O
mean, O
you O
know, O
“The O
King O
of O
Rock O
n’ O
Roll.” O
David: B-PER
Well, O
every O
time O
when O
we O
have O
some O
big O
deals, O
we O
try O
not O
to O
think O
about O
it O
that O
much O
because O
then O
you O
get O
like O
anxious, O
and O
you O
feel O
the O
pressure. O
When O
we O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
play O
a O
cover O
of O
Elvis, B-PER
we O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
we O
were O
confronting O
Elvis B-PER
because O
that O
would O
have O
been O
impossible, O
you O
cannot O
try O
to O
fight O
with O
Elvis’ B-PER
heritage. O

We O
were O
just O
super O
happy O
and O
super O
glad O
and O
super O
honored O
just O
to O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
play O
one O
of O
his O
songs O
, O
and O
we O
focused O
on O
that O
, O
and O
we O
focused O
on O
doing O
the O
best O
that O
we O
could O
do O
on O
that O
song O
without O
even O
comparing O
it O
with O
the O
Elvis B-PER
one O
because O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it’s O
untouchable O
. O
Now O
you O
have O
two O
VMA B-ORG
nominations O
and O
a O
third O
number O
one O
song O
on O
the O
Billboard B-ORG
charts O
, O
“Supermodel O
, O
can O
you O
tell O
me O
what O
the O
song O
is O
about O
? O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
The O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
everyone O
thinks O
it’s O
about O
supermodels O
, O
but O
it’s O
not O
. O
We O
wrote O
it O
after O
being O
like O
three O
months O
in O
L.A. B-LOC
where O
we O
met O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
were O
faking O
being O
supermodels O
or O
superstars O
. O
Everyone O
was O
very O
focused O
on O
the O
way O
they O
appeared O
and O
not O
what O
they’re O
really O
like O
or O
who O
they O
really O
were O
. O
Everyone O
was O
just O
trying O
to O
fake O
that O
they O
have O
the O
best O
clothes O
, O
best O
friends O
, O
best O
club O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
, O
and O
we O
found O
it O
a O
bit O
stupid O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
it O
was O
something O
that O
we O
thought O
was O
only O
shown O
in O
movies O
, O
like O
a O
stereotype O
, O
you O
know O
, O
but O
when O
we O
saw O
it O
in O
person O
, O
we O
just O
thought O
it O
was O
fun O
and O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
funny O
song O
about O
it O
. O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
no O
one O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
is O
like O
that O
. O

We O
are O
very O
real O

If O
you O
had O
to O
make O
a O
song O
about O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
what O
would O
it O
be O
about O
? O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Ohhh O
. O
.. O
(laughs) O
… O
we O
need O
to O
spend O
more O
months O
here O
. O
David B-PER
: O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
like O
a O
club O
song O
, O
super O
dirty O
, O
clubbish O
… O
(laughter) O
. O
You’ve O
played O
different O
festivals O
, O
like O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
but O
this O
weekend O
you O
are O
doing O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
in O
Chicago B-LOC
. O

What O
does O
it O
mean O
to O
play O
at O
Lollapalooza B-ORG
here O
in O
the O
US B-LOC
: O
Raggi B-PER
: O
Crazy O
, O
it’s O
huge O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
It’s O
our O
first O
Festival O
in O
the O
USA B-LOC
. O
So O
, O
that’s O
like O
a O
big O
, O
big O
thing O
… O
David B-PER
: O
It’s O
not O
our O
first O
festival O
! O
We O
played O
at O
Coachella B-ORG
, O
c’mon O
! O

… O
(Laughter) O
De B-PER
Angelis: I-PER
Whoops, O
that’s O
true, O
Coachella. O
We O
started O
this O
festival O
season O
this O
summer, O
and O
it’s O
only O
been O
Europe B-LOC
until O
now, O
so O
for O
this O
summer O
it’s O
the O
first. O
Raggi: B-PER
For O
the O
summer, O
yes. O
You O
sing O
in O
English B-MISC
and O
Italian, B-MISC
but O
we O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
Italian B-MISC
singers O
who O
are O
huge O
in O
Latin B-MISC
America, B-LOC
and O
they O
sing O
in O
Spanish B-MISC
– O
Laura B-PER
Pausini, I-PER
Eros B-PER
Ramazzotti, I-PER
Il B-MISC
Volo I-MISC
– O
do O
you O
think O
you O
would O
ever O
sing O
in O
Spanish? O
David: B-PER
Why O
not? O

De O
Angelis B-PER
: O
In O
Spanish B-MISC
? O
David B-PER
: O
I O
basically O
mostly O
listen O
to O
Spanish B-MISC
sounding O
music O
, O
so O
I O
would O
not O
back O
up O
… O
(laughs) O
You’re O
going O
to O
launch O
your O
tour O
, O
and O
you’re O
going O
to O
Latin B-MISC
America I-MISC
, O
Santiago B-LOC
, O
Buenos B-LOC
Aires I-LOC
. O
What’s O
it O
like O
going O
to O
all O
these O
places O
, O
is O
it O
a O
culture O
shock O
when O
you O
go O
? O
David B-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
you O
know O
, O
we O
have O
never O
been O
, O
outside O
of O
Ethan B-PER
, O
we’ve O
never O
been O
to O
Latin B-MISC
America I-MISC
, O
and O
we O
never O
played O
there O
, O
but O
of O
course O
, O
we O
know O
something O
about O
the O
people O
there O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
they’re O
really O
crazy O
… O
(laughter) O
… O
hyped O
up O
, O
heated O
up O
, O
and O
we O
like O
these O
kinds O
of O
crowds O
. O
So O
, O
we O
can’t O
wait O
to O
play O
there O
, O
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
amazed O
me O
the O
most O

When O
I O
saw O
the O
tickets O
that O
were O
selling O
, O
it O
was O
like O
“ O
what O
the O
f**k O
?” O
how O
did O
we O
get O
there O
? O
It O
was O
crazy O
, O
so O
we O
really O
can’t O
wait O
to O
be O
there O
. O
How O
has O
fame O
changed O
you O
, O
if O
at O
all O
? O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
I O
don’t O
think O
it O
has O
changed O
us O
. O
David B-PER
: O
I’m O
less O
worried O
about O
things O
, O
actually O

I O
guess O
I’m O
stable O
… O
(laughs) O
Do O
you O
feel O
that O
fame O
, O
when O
you’re O
this O
well-known O
, O
it O
comes O
with O
a O
responsibility O
to O
speak O
out O
on O
certain O
political O
issues O
? O
A O
lot O
of O
artists O
say O
, O
I’m O
an O
entertainer O
, O
not O
a O
politician O
or O
an O
activist O
. O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
Yeah O
, O
for O
us O
, O
I O
think O
it O
comes O
naturally O
, O
so O
when O
we O
think O
we O
know O
enough O
about O
a O
topic O
, O
and O
we O
think O
our O
opinion O
can O
, O
like O
, O
make O
the O
difference O
or O
something O
we O
don’t O
feel O
it O
like O
as O
a O
pressure O
or O
something O
. O
It O
just O
comes O
naturally O
, O
and O
we’re O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O
Also O
, O
if O
we O
can O
share O
a O
positive O
message O
on O
something O
that O
really O
matters O
to O
us O
, O
we’re O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
. O

If O
not O
, O
we O
also O
don’t O
feel O
the O
pressure O
to O
have O
to O
do O
it O
. O
You O
did O
a O
song O
in O
support O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
“ O
We’re O
Gonna O
Dance O
on O
Gasoline O
, O
” O
how O
do O
you O
feel O
about O
that O
situation O
? O
David B-PER
: O
It’s O
really O
hard O
to O
say O
that O
because O
we O
feel O
very O
bad O
about O
it O
, O
but O
we O
also O
know O
that O
we O
have O
a O
huge O
privilege O
, O
with O
no O
worries O
, O
we’re O
not O
worried O
that O
something O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
us O
. O

So, O
we O
are O
privileged, O
but O
of O
course, O
if O
we O
can O
spread O
knowledge O
about O
it, O
we O
are O
more O
than O
happy, O
and O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
because O
that’s O
something O
that O
is O
happening O
today O
and O
if O
we O
can O
do O
something O
today, O
it’s O
more O
valuable. O
One O
of O
your O
first O
songs O
was O
“Zitti B-MISC
E I-MISC
Buoni,” I-MISC
which O
means O
“Shut B-MISC
Up I-MISC
and O
Behave.” O
It O
doesn’t O
seem O
like O
you O
guys O
are O
going O
to O
be O
doing O
any O
shutting O
up O
or O
behaving O
any O
time O
soon. O
De B-PER
Angelis: I-PER
No, O
not O
at O
all. O

Where O
do O
you O
go O
from O
here O
: O
De B-PER
Angelis I-PER
: O
I O
don’t O
know O
, O
we O
feel O
very O
free O
. O
We O
just O
want O
to O
keep O
playing O
. O
We O
have O
so O
many O
amazing O
gigs O
and O
tours O
coming O
in O
front O
of O
us O
, O
so O
I O
think O
we’re O
really O
going O
to O
enjoy O
it O
and O
get O
all O
the O
possible O
inspiration O
from O
that O
and O
then O
turn O
it O
into O
music O
. O
We O
don’t O
want O
to O
set O
any O
specific O
goals O
, O
but O
we O
just O
want O
to O
go O
on O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
and O
keep O
getting O
better O
and O
doing O
what O
we O
feel O
is O
right O
. O
CNN’s B-ORG
Marysabel B-PER
Huston-Crespo I-PER
contributed O
to O
this O
report O
. O

When O
a O
bipartisan O
group O
of O
lawmakers O
visited O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
border O
in O
March O
, O
an O
unexpected O
guest O
showed O
up O
on O
the O
trip O
: O
GOP B-ORG
Rep. O
Victoria B-PER
Spartz I-PER
of O
Indiana B-LOC
. O
Spartz B-PER
, O
the O
first O
Ukrainian-born O
member O
of O
the O
US B-ORG
Congress I-ORG
and O
an O
outspoken O
advocate O
for O
her O
home O
country O
, O
had O
expressed O
interest O
in O
joining O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
but O
wasn’t O
invited O
to O
attend O
the O
trip O
, O
which O
consisted O
primarily O
of O
House B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
members O
, O
a O
panel O
where O
Spartz B-PER
is O
not O
a O
member O
. O
So O
, O
she O
used O
her O
own O
funds O
to O
fly O
to O
the O
border O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
linked O
up O
with O
lawmakers O
once O
there O
to O
join O
in O
on O
some O
of O
their O
meetings O
, O
according O
to O
multiple O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
situation O
. O
Her O
surprise O
appearance O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
which O
have O
not O
been O
previously O
reported O
, O
was O
initially O
viewed O
as O
a O
welcome O
addition O
– O
albeit O
an O
unusual O
one O
– O
as O
lawmakers O
sought O
to O
rally O
Western O
support O
for O
Ukraine B-LOC
amid O
Russia’s B-LOC
bloody O
assault O
on O
the O
country O
that O
began O
a O
week O
earlier O
. O
But O
members O
who O
were O
part O
of O
the O
official O
trip O
told O
CNN B-ORG
that O
Spartz B-PER
was O
“argumentative O
, O
“accusatory O
, O
and O
“unhelpful” O
during O
key O
meetings O
with O
NATO B-ORG
members O
, O
generals O

government O
officials O
, O
sparking O
concern O
that O
her O

more O

good O
. O
“She O
crashed O
our O

She O
was O
like O
a O

in O
a O

said O
one O
GOP B-ORG

who O
like O
other O
members O
for O
this O
story O
was O
granted O
anonymity O
to O
speak O
more O

about O
a O

due O
to O
the O

nature O
of O
the O

“I O

she O
was O
getting O
enough O
proper O
information O
, O
but O
she O
was O
just O
accusatory O
and O
rude.” O
Spartz B-PER
, O
in O
an O
email O
to O
CNN B-ORG
, O
pushed O
back O
on O
the O
anonymous O
criticism O
of O
her O
decision O
to O
elbow O
her O
way O
into O
the O
congressional O
delegation O
and O
refuted O
the O
description O
of O
her O
behavior O
on O
the O
trip O
. O
“This O
accusation O
is O
a O
cowardly O
misrepresentation O
of O
facts O
by O
some O
jealous O
members O
or O
staff O
since O
we O
had O
a O
very O
productive O
bipartisan O
CODEL O
in O
March O
,” O
Spartz B-PER
said O
. O
“I O
did O
not O
come O
to O
Congress B-ORG
to O
get O
paid O
for O
my O
travel O
vacations O
or O
dinners O
, O
but O
rather O
get O
things O
done O
. O
I O
have O
always O
been O
willing O
to O
spend O
my O
own O
hard-earned O
money O
to O
help O
with O
causes O
I O
care O
about.” O
That O
bipartisan O
frustration O
over O
Spartz’s B-PER
behavior O
was O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O
In O
the O
nearly O
six O
months O
since O
the O
war O
began O
, O
Spartz B-PER
has O
publicly O
criticized O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
government O
, O
peddled O
corruption O
allegations O
against O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
government O
and O
some O
of O
Ukrainian B-LOC
President O
Volodymyr B-PER
Zelensky’s I-PER
top O
aides O
, O
and O
spurred O
complaints O
from O
her O
colleagues O
that O
she O
is O
mir O

roring O
pro-Russia O
talking O
points O
. O
“ O
President O
Zelensky B-PER
has O
to O
stop O
playing O
politics O
and O
theater O
, O
and O
start O
governing O
to O
better O
support O
his O
military O
and O
local O
governments O
, O
” O
Spartz B-PER
said O
in O
a O
press O
release O
last O
month O
, O
in O
one O
example O
of O
her O
outspoken O
criticisms O
of O
Kyiv B-LOC
. O
Spartz B-PER
, O
a O
43-year-old O
businesswoman O
, O
has O
repeatedly O
insisted O
, O
publicly O
and O
privately O
, O
that O
she O
wants O
Ukraine B-LOC
to O
win O
, O
and O
that O
she O
is O
only O
attacking O
Kyiv B-LOC
because O
she O
wants O
to O
help O
remove O
any O
potential O
obstacles O
to O
a O
Ukrainian B-MISC
victory O
over O
Russia B-LOC
. O
She O
says O
she O
has O
visited O
Ukraine B-LOC
six O
times O
since O
the O
invasion O
began O
and O
has O
also O
slammed O
Russia B-LOC
consistently O
, O
including O
as O
recently O
as O
Tuesday O
when O
she O
tweeted O
that O
Russia B-LOC
should O
be O
declared O
a O
terrorist O
state O
. O
Still O
, O
Spartz’s B-PER
bellicose O
rhetoric O
aimed O
at O
Zelensky B-PER
and O
his O
advisers O
has O
frustrated O
lawmakers O
in O
both O
parties O
, O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
officials O
and O
members O
of O
the O
Ukrainian B-MISC
parliament O
alike O
. O
They O
worry O
she O
is O
undermining O
their O
efforts O
to O
stay O
united O
behind O
Ukraine B-LOC
at O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
and O
openly O
question O
where O
she O
is O
getting O
some O
of O
her O
information O
, O
according O
to O
interviews O
with O
over O
a O
dozen O
lawmakers O
, O
aides O
and O
administration O
sources O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
multiple O
briefings O
from O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
and O
private O
pleas O
from O
senior O
Republicans B-ORG
have O
done O
little O
to O
rein O
in O
Spartz’s B-PER
vocal O
criticism O
, O
sources O
said O
. O
Once O
seen O
as O
a O
crucial O
messaging O
asset O
, O
Spartz B-PER
has O
now O
become O
something O
of O
a O
liability O
for O
defense O
hawks O
who O
were O
already O
worried O
about O
fatigue O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
over O
the O
ongoing O
war O
abroad O
. O
And O
her O
continued O
criticism O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
also O
comes O
amid O
growing O
skepticism O
from O
the O
MAGA B-MISC
wing O
of O
the O
GOP B-ORG
about O
keeping O
weapons O
and O
aid O
flowing O
to O
the O
country O
. O

Because O
she’s O
the O
only O
Ukrainian-born O
member O
of O
Congress B-ORG
, O
she O
has O
outsize O
megaphone O
, O
outsize O
influence O
, O
Rep. O
Elissa B-PER
Slotkin I-PER
, O
a O
Michigan B-LOC
Democrat O
and O
former O
CIA B-ORG
analyst O
, O
said O
to O
CNN B-ORG
. O
I O
think O
there’s O
an O
open O
question O
of O
why O
she’s O
so O
openly O
saying O
something O
that’s O
so O
clearly O
aligned O
with O
Russian B-LOC
talking O
points O
. O
Spartz B-PER
contends O
she O
has O
long O
been O
concerned O
about O
corruption O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O
But O
lawmakers O
fear O
her O
public O
criticism O
could O
undermine O
confidence O
in O
Zelensky B-PER
, O
damage O
relations O
between O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
and O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
and O
give O
on-the-fence O
lawmakers O
a O
reason O
to O
oppose O
the O
next O
aid O
package O
. O
Some O
lawmakers O
– O
even O
those O
unhappy O
with O
her O
rhetoric O
– O
came O
to O
Spartz’s B-PER
defense O
, O
arguing O
she O
is O
well-intentioned O
and O
just O
desperate O
to O
help O
her O
motherland O
as O
it’s O
being O
ripped O
apart O
by O
war O
. O
Spartz B-PER
was O
a O
vocal O
champion O
of O
key O
legislation O
to O
speed O
up O
the O
administration’s O
ability O
to O
send O
weaponry O
and O
other O
critical O
resources O
to O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
attending O
the O
bill O
signing O
ceremony O
with O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
. O
And O
lawmakers O
in O
both O
parties O
have O
shared O
in O
her O
calls O
for O
more O
rigorous O
oversight O
of O
the O
weapons O
heading O
into O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

She O
was O
overcome O
with O
emotion O
. O

And O
I O
think O
what O
you’re O
seeing O
now O
is O
a O
manifestation O
of O
that O
,” O
said O
a O
second O
GOP B-ORG
lawmaker O
. O

What O
I’m O
trying O
to O
tell O
her O
is O
, O
I’m O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
corruption O
problem O
. O

But O
talking O
about O
corruption O
now O
, O
when O
they O
are O
under O
siege O
, O
is O
like O
wall-papering O
your O
bathroom O
when O
the O
house O
is O
burning O
down O
around O
you O
. O
It’s O
counterproductive O
. O
Spartz B-PER
said O
in O
an O
email O
to O
CNN B-ORG
that O
she O
is O
just O
seeking O
accountability O
and O
always O
gets O
her O
information O
“from O
the O
ground O
and O
real O
professionals O
, O
not O
from O
academics O
and O
political O
hacks O
who’ve O
never O
set O
foot O
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O
And O
Spartz B-PER
said O
it O
was O
the O
“foreign O
policy O
establishment O
” O
– O
not O
her O
– O
who O
was O
playing O
into O
Russian B-LOC
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin’s I-PER
hands O
. O
“I O
also O
care O
deeply O
about O
people’s O
lives O
– O
the O
lives O
of O
ordinary O
Ukrainians B-MISC
and O
the O
brave O
Ukrainian B-MISC
military O
. O

I O
cannot O
let O
them O
down O
even O
if O
that O
means O
saying O
unpopular O
truths O
that O
offend O
the O
politicians O
or O
diverge O
from O
the O
popular O
narrative O
of O
the O
day O

Spartz B-PER
said O

“ O
I O
will O
never O
give O
up O

give O
in O

and O
I O
will O
do O
everything O
