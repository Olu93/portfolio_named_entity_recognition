353,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/health/tpoxx-access-problems/,"A drug is available for monkeypox patients who have or who are at risk of severe disease, but doctors say they continue to face challenges getting access to it. The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US.   Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox.  It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access.  However, doctors across the country suggest that significant barriers remain, causing some patients to wait days for shipments or travel to find medical centers that can provide the product at all. “Patients are trying hard to get this medication, even going out of city or out of state in some cases,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health. His hospital has fielded calls from patients throughout California as well as from Colorado and even Canada and the UK, all hoping to get treatment.  Health agencies cut red tape, but challenges persist The CDC says doctors may want to use Tpoxx for people who have monkeypox symptoms in particularly hazardous areas like the eyes, mouth, genitals or anus. It may also be used in people with severe symptoms like sepsis or brain inflammation, or in people at high risk of severe illness, including those with weakened immune systems because of conditions like HIV/AIDS, those with skin conditions like eczema, children, pregnant women and people with other complications like a bacterial skin infection. Many people who have gotten sick during the outbreak have had mild symptoms and have recovered without treatment, but some doctors say they’ve seen more patients with severe disease than they expected.   Dr. Mary Foote, medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in late July that about 20% to 25% of patients there have met the criteria for Tpoxx. As of July 23, the treatment had been prescribed for about 215 out of 839 confirmed cases. “Anecdotally, of the providers that we’ve spoken to, we’ve seen, very commonly, significant improvements within just a few days of starting and improvements in pain. And very significantly, we have not seen any significant adverse events reported and very few even mild adverse events. Some headaches, nausea. But that’s pretty much it,” Foote said. However, it’s unclear what proportion of the more than 5,000 probable or confirmed cases nationwide have been treated with Tpoxx. CDC officials said in a webinar that more than 223 people had been treated as of July 22, but the agency did not respond to requests for a more specific number. Experts say the number who’ve been treated is probably a fraction of those eligible.  “I think a majority of patients don’t have access,” Chin-Hong said. He’s seen firsthand how hard it can be to get the drug. Chin-Hong treated Kevin Kwong, 34, after he developed painful lesions all over his hands, feet and face that spread to his back, thighs and scalp. “There were moments I could barely swallow food because of the sores in the back of my throat,” Kwong said. Lesions near his eye threatened to have long-term effects on his vision. But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home.  But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr. Jason Zucker, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Chin-Hong says that aside from the paperwork, there’s a high “activation energy” that clinics and hospitals face because the drug is considered experimental for monkeypox and some hospitals and institutions require additional reviews for such treatments. As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center.  A Pennsylvania man named Adam says it also took him several days to get access to Tpoxx. Adam had a fever, swollen lymph nodes and body aches, he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The rashes that characterize monkeypox appeared around his groin, arms, throat and face.  “I would kind of liken it to a crossbreed of Covid, strep throat, mono, kind of all those things together is how monkeypox felt, in addition to the pox, which, that was an experience for sure,” he said. His doctors were concerned that one lesion under an eyelash could affect his vision.   “He had a lesion on the inside of his lid, but if that would rupture, he would auto-inoculate his eye and could get a keratitis,” said Dr. Stacy Lane of the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, who treated Adam. She worried that it could put him at risk of blindness.  “By the time I was initially seen and talked about the eyeball, I wasn’t put on the antiviral until almost a week later,” Adam said. In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center.  The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals. Every region or every area will have its own problem,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.  “If you’re a private physician or your clinic doesn’t have access to Tpoxx immediately, you might have it shipped from the national stockpile, and you have to have a full process – you know, guidelines, shipping itself takes time, filling out the paperwork – so that can take a couple of days. “In New York City, you’re able to e-prescribe with certain pharmacies that would be able to make sure the appropriate paperwork is filled out to go and have that delivered in a much faster time,” he said. How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox.   “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead.   Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “The unfortunate parallel is that the US is behind the UK and Europe in running these trials,” he said. Lane said she’s hopeful that the CDC and public health departments will continue to work toward better access to the medication. But her expectations are measured.  “Until the FDA approves this for monkeypox or the National Stockpile releases the stockpile for more normal distribution, this is where we’re at,” she said.",Mary

57,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/liz-cheney-justice-department-january-6-ccntv/,"Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said if the Justice Department does not prosecute former President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol and “the facts and the evidence are there,” the decision could call into question whether the United States can “call ourselves a nation of laws.”  In an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt, Cheney – the GOP vice chair of the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection – said Trump is “guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history” and pointed to a judge who’s said he likely committed crimes. She said the House committee is “going to continue to follow the facts. I think Department of Justice will do that. But they have to make decisions about prosecution.”   “Understanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute – how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws? I think that’s a very serious, serious balancing,” Cheney said.  “The question for us is, are we a nation of laws? Are we a country where no one is above the law? And what do the facts and the evidence show?” Cheney said.  She sidestepped questions about whether Trump being prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department would only add to his strength with the Republican Party’s base ahead of the 2024 presidential bid that Trump has repeatedly teased.  “I don’t think that it’s appropriate to think about it that way,” said Cheney, who’s facing a Trump-backed challenger in a primary later this month.  She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up. The House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections.  Cheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.  Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.  “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot. “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Dick Cheney adds. Liz Cheney wouldn’t say whether her father has urged her to run for president in 2024. “Look, Dick Cheney is a big Liz Cheney supporter,” she said. She said the former vice president shares “this real sadness, frankly, about what’s happening to our party, and a real despair about how it could be that so many Republicans would refuse to stand up and tell the truth.” “And it is a scary moment for the nation,” she added. Cheney says more to come from the committee this fall  Liz Cheney, who has courted Democratic voters in Wyoming’s primary, said she doesn’t see the House committee’s work through the lens of political outcomes.  Cheney said the House panel will continue to lay out evidence in the coming months and that she expects the committee to “have an opinion” about making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “There’s much more that we have not yet shared in hearings and that we anticipate we will share in the fall,” she said. “And we will also make decisions about criminal referrals. And ultimately, the decision about prosecution’s up to the Justice Department. But I would anticipate that the committee will have an opinion on it.”  Cheney said that during the committee’s probe, she has learned that Trump’s effort to block the 2020 election results were “a more sophisticated and broader-reaching effort than I understood coming into it.”  “I think all of us on the committee have had that same reaction, which is that there’s so much, there was so much more that was happening in multiple different areas, whether it was the pressure on state officials or the pressure on the Justice Department” or efforts to push former Vice President Mike Pence to reject some states’ electoral votes.  “The volume of information has been more than I expected,” she said.  Cheney praised Pence for rejecting the pressure from Trump. She said Pence, who, as vice president oversaw the session of Congress in which electoral votes were officially counted, “was a hero on January 6.”  “It’s very clear that there was tremendous pressure from a number of different places on him. And he did his duty and he didn’t succumb to that pressure and if he had succumbed to that pressure, things would have been very different,” she said. “And so I think that that we owe him gratitude for how he conducted himself and for his refusal to do what Donald Trump wanted him to do, which would have been illegal.”  Cheney faces voters on August 16  Cheney said she expects to win her primary in less than two weeks, despite her opponents attacking her role on the committee.  “I don’t expect to lose. I’m working hard to earn every single vote and, ultimately, I really believe that the people of Wyoming fundamentally understand how important fidelity to the Constitution is; understand how important it is that we fight for those fundamental principles on which everything else is based,” she said. However, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017. “We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.” Asked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make. I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.” Cheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024. She said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not. Cheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall.  Republicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan. “I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024. “I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said. Cheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him. Cheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.” “All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.” CLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.

501,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/rnc-2024-milwaukee/,"Republicans will officially head to Milwaukee to select their next presidential nominee, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announced Friday, describing the host of the party’s 2024 convention as “a great city.” The convention site was unanimously approved by RNC members during a closed-door vote Friday morning at the party’s annual summer meeting here. McDaniel was joined by former White House chief of staff and onetime RNC chairman Reince Priebus, along with members of the party’s Wisconsin delegation for the announcement.  “In the next two years, we look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the community to make this an event that highlights not just our nominee … but the great city that Milwaukee is,” McDaniel said.  Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, defended the decision to host the convention in his city, telling CNN the move “does not mean” Milwaukee is “signing up for the platform of the Republican Party.”  “My stance, and I think that most Democrats understand this, is that this is not a political decision, it is a business decision,” Johnson said. “It will present an opportunity for us to have millions of dollars of economic impact … for us to fill our restaurants, our bars, our hotels, and to support our hospitality industry that’s been battered by Covid, of course, over the last couple of years.”  Johnson joined McDaniel Friday to officially unveil Milwaukee as the convention site choice, just days after Nashville fell out of contention as a potential alternative. Milwaukee began its bid to be a convention host nearly a year ago, and city representatives met with RNC officials in February as they toured finalist cities, which included Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh at the time. Both cities were later removed from the running.  Later Friday, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha to campaign for Tim Michels, the GOP candidate for governor, ahead of the state’s primary next week. Trump’s sustained popularity with the GOP base would likely position him as a front-runner in a crowded 2024 GOP primary should he launch another presidential campaign, as is widely expected.  Johnson, who said he will actively campaign for President Joe Biden’s reelection in 2024, dismissed security concerns about protests around the convention in Milwaukee, including if Trump – one of the most polarizing figures in American politics – is the Republican nominee.  “I think that any time you host a large-scale event, there is potential for that sort of activity. Our police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention,” Johnson said, noting that Milwaukee was originally supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention before it switched to a virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic.  “The police in Milwaukee are already well prepared for this and will really be in a prime position to execute what we were about to execute the last go-round,” Johnson said.

222,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/lawrence-rudolph-wife-killed-zambia-cec/,"Lawrence and Bianca Rudolph shared a passion for big game hunting. In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents.  Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported.   “I did not kill my wife. I could not murder my wife. I would not murder my wife,” he told jurors.  Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents say. He found her bleeding on the floor of their cabin at Kafue National Park, he says. But federal prosecutors allege Rudolph killed his wife for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend. CNN has reached out to Rudolph’s attorney, David Markus, but has not heard back.  In a motion Markus filed in January listing his client’s assets, he said Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In the court document, he noted that Rudolph is worth millions, including a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million.  Life insurance companies based in Colorado paid Rudolph over $4.8 million after his wife’s death, according to court documents. The rush to cremate his wife sparked suspicion, investigators say In court documents, investigators allege Rudolph quickly sought to cremate his wife’s body in Zambia after the shooting. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents.  Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. “Zambian authorities and five insurers determined that Bianca Rudolph died accidentally. Witnesses told the FBI that Dr. Rudolph did nothing to interfere in the investigation. No physical evidence supports the government’s murder theory,” Markus wrote in the January motion.   The suspect wanted to be with his girlfriend, prosecutors allege But federal investigators say there’s more to the story. Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleges.   Federal authorities got involved after a friend of the victim reached out to the FBI and asked the agency to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs in the past and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death.  Rudolph’s then-girlfriend, who was not named in the court documents, worked as a manager at his dental practice near Pittsburgh, and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, Peterson wrote. The former employee told the FBI that the girlfriend told her she gave Rudolph an ultimatum of one year to sell his dental offices and leave his wife, court documents allege. Three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, the girlfriend moved in with him, Peterson wrote in court documents. An executive director of their subdivision’s community association told investigators that Rudolph and his girlfriend tried to buy another home in the same subdivision for $3.5 million. Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states.  A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support.

280,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/entertainment/atlanta-music-festival-canceled/,"The Atlanta music festival Music Midtown, which draws tens of thousands of concertgoers and blockbuster musicians each year, “will no longer be taking place this year,” organizers announced in a tweet Monday.   Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet. The music festival was set to feature a “diverse lineup of over 30 artists across 4 stages,” including My Chemical Romance, Future, Jack White and Fall Out Boy among others, according to the festival website. “We were looking forward to reuniting in September and hope we can all get back to enjoying the festival together again soon,” the organizers said. Last year’s festival attracted some 50,000 people and featured performances by Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, and Maroon 5, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Atlanta City Council President Doug Shipman said it was a “sad day” after the cancellation was announced. “Public policy has real impacts and in this case- economic and social implications on a great tradition,” Shipman tweeted.

17,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/biden-agenda-energy-health-care-bill/,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. It’s a make-or-break week for President Joe Biden’s agenda.  The deal on energy and health care that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin announced last week has a narrow window to navigate both chambers of Congress and land on the President’s desk before August recess.  And with the shock of the deal’s announcement wearing off, GOP opposition, public scrutiny, and Democrats’ slim majorities will all have a say in whether the legislation is a breakthrough or a bust.  Here’s what you need to know.  What’s in the bill?  The agreement contains a number of Democrats’ goals, including some provisions that party leaders have worked toward for years: What’s not in the bill? To be clear, this isn’t Build Back Better 2.0. The package is less than half the size of Biden’s original social safety net plan, and a number of key Democratic priorities are likely to be left out, including: What are Republicans saying? The package, as it stands, is facing furious GOP opposition. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee released data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that showed that Americans of all incomes would see their federal taxes rise under the climate and health care package. That analysis, however, looked at the indirect effect of the 15% minimum tax provision on corporations. Economists assume companies would then pass along part of their tax increase to employees by reducing their after-tax wages and job opportunities. Also, shareholders would take a hit since the value of their stock holdings, including those held in pensions and mutual funds, would likely decline. What’s Biden saying? The President has urged congressional Democrats to quickly pass the surprise agreement “for America.” “This bill is far from perfect. It’s a compromise. But it’s often how progress is made, by compromises. The fact is that my message to Congress is this: This is the strongest bill you can pass to lower inflation, cut the deficit, reduce health care costs, tackle the climate crises and promote energy security – all the time while reducing the burdens facing working-class and middle-class families,” Biden said during a speech at the White House the day after the deal was announced. What’s the timeline? The health and climate bill stands a serious chance of becoming law as soon as August, assuming it passes muster with the Senate parliamentarian to allow it to be approved along straight party lines in the budget process – and all Democrats vote for it (more on that below) – and that the House passes it. Democrats need all 50 of their senators to be present and vote in favor of the bill with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote, as all Republicans are expected to vote against the deal. Manchin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday he hopes the legislation passes before the August recess. “I think it’s a great piece of legislation and on normal times, my Republican colleagues would be for something such as this. We’ve basically paid down debt, (which) is what they want. We’ve accelerated permitting, which is what they want. And we’ve increased production of energy, which is what they want. We’ve done things that we should be doing together,” Manchin said.  Will Democrats be united? All eyes in Washington are on Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a key moderate, who has not yet weighed in on the bill. She has previously raised concerns about taxes on carried interest, which would raise $14 billion under the deal. Sinema was not part of negotiations for the current package. Asked about getting the support of his Arizona colleague, Manchin said on Sunday, “We work very close together on so many things, and she has so much in this piece of legislation. She’s formed quite a bit of and worked on it very hard.” “I think that basically when she looks at the bill and sees the whole spectrum of what we’re doing … hopefully she will be positive about it, but she’ll make her decision and I respect that,” he added.  How did this come together? Read this report from CNN’s Capitol Hill team. The climate and tax deal came together in almost complete secret, catching many by surprise when it was announced. Schumer and Manchin have been in revived talks since July 18 and locked down a deal last Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. Manchin had thrown cold water on doing tax and energy provisions as part of the deal, but ultimately agreed to it.

485,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/opinions/cpac-jail-cell-booth-january-6-obeidallah/,"Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show” and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. The Conservative Political Action Conference made it clear over the weekend in Texas whose side it’s on in the fight against domestic terrorism. First, it featured former President Donald Trump as its star speaker. Here is a man who not only was allegedly involved in waging an attempted coup to overturn the 2020 election but who also summoned his supporters to Washington on January 6, 2021, for a “wild” protest. Then on that fateful day, he inflamed them with his words and directed them to head to the US Capitol to “Stop the Steal.” And as some of his supporters brutally beat police officers, built gallows while chanting to hang his vice president and broke into the Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s win, Trump did nothing for more than three hours to stop the attack. (Trump has denied responsibility for the insurrection.) CPAC also welcomed as a speaker Viktor Orban, Hungary’s autocratic Prime Minister, who a week earlier had given a speech in which he declared that in Europe “we do not want to become peoples of mixed race.” Those words prompted a longtime Orban aide to resign, slamming his remarks as “pure Nazi text.” But the cherry on the sundae was a CPAC panel showcasing Brandon Straka, who pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in the January 6 attack, as part of a larger exhibit designed to elicit sympathy for the Capitol attackers still in prison. As part of his guilty plea to a misdemeanor, Straka admitted to urging the violent mob to rip a riot shield from a police officer, shouting, “Take it! Take it!,” The Washington Post reported. Straka ultimately received 90 days’ home confinement and three years’ probation after agreeing to cooperate with law enforcement. But just last week, a federal judge slammed Straka for making public comments inconsistent with his statements to investigators, raising the possibility that he could be charged with lying to federal authorities, NPR reported. Nevertheless, Straka appeared on a CPAC panel with Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, criticizing the House member for not doing more to help protesters who have been arrested in connection with the January 6 riot and eliciting jeers from the audience for the lawmaker, according to Vice News.  In an apparent effort to get into the crowd’s good graces, according to Vice News and video of the event, Biggs then vowed to “start defunding some of these bad agencies, the FBI, the DOJ.” Yes, a GOP member of Congress reportedly told the crowd that he would begin to defund the Justice Department and FBI for having the audacity to prosecute January 6 attackers. Then came the pièce de résistance: a headline-grabbing, jaw-dropping exhibit that featured a prison cell that housed a person dressed in an orange jumpsuit, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap. CPAC attendees were invited to put on headsets to listen to actual messages from the January 6 attackers.  A CPAC representative told BuzzFeed News that the #Walk Away group founded by Straka ran the booth. In the past, CPAC has reportedly banned a booth from an atheist organization and the Log Cabin Republicans, an LGBT group, as an event sponsor.  On Thursday, an actor played the prisoner, complete with tears as he stood in front of a chalkboard that read, “Where is Everyone?” But on Friday – in a surreal case of life imitating art – Straka portrayed the prisoner in the cell. Vice News reported that the line to see Straka stretched clear to the back of the exhibit hall.  It wasn’t long before right-wing firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – who has long called the jailed January 6 attackers “political prisoners” – entered the fake jail cell and led a prayer for those still imprisoned for their role in the January 6 attack.  Let’s put politics aside and look at the facts. January 6 was an act of “domestic terrorism,” as FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress. Just as we would call anyone involved in the far deadlier September 11, 2001, attacks “terrorists” – we would do the same for anyone who played a role on January 6. For some people, the idea of calling a white American a terrorist is uncomfortable, but there’s no place for timidity when the stakes are this high. Those behind the mock jail cell at CPAC want you to have sympathy for the worst of the January 6 attackers. The overwhelmingly majority of people arrested in connection with the January 6 attack have been granted bail, according to PolitiFact.  Those defendants still in jail deserve to be there because of the severity of crimes with which they have been charged. Among them are members of the Oath Keepers militia and the Proud Boys – some of whom were charged with “seditious conspiracy” – and others who are accused of brutally beating police officers and other heinous acts. Judges hearing the charges against these suspects have deemed that they pose a threat to the community were they to be released on bail.   Imagine if, about 18 months after a terrorist attack, a booth at a Democratic event attempted to elicit sympathy for those arrested for their role in a deadly strike on our nation! Critics would lash out at Democrats as unpatriotic Americans who support terrorism. And they would be right to do so.   That’s the same revulsion the vile display at CPAC deserves from all of us.

255,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/fema-emergency-alert-software-warning/,"Vulnerabilities in software that TV and radio networks around the country use to transmit emergency alerts could allow a hacker to broadcast fake messages over the alert system, a Federal Emergency Management Agency official tells CNN. A cybersecurity researcher provided FEMA with “compelling evidence to suggest certain unpatched and unsecured EAS [Emergency Alert System] devices are indeed vulnerable,” said Mark Lucero, the chief engineer for Integrated Public Alert & Warning System, the national system that state and local officials use to send urgent alerts about natural disasters or child abductions. The agency this week urged operators of the devices to update their software to address the issue, saying that the false alerts could in theory be issued over TV, radio and cable networks. The advisory did not say that alerts sent over text messages were affected. There is no evidence that malicious hackers have exploited the vulnerabilities, Lucero said. It’s unclear how many emergency alert system devices are running the vulnerable software. FEMA referred a request for an estimate of that figure to the FCC, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ken Pyle, the cybersecurity researcher who discovered the issue, told CNN that he acquired several of the EAS devices independently and found poor security controls. He shared an example of a fake alert he crafted, but did not send, that declared a “civil emergency” for certain counties and areas in the US. TV and radio networks own and operate the equipment and transmit the emergency alerts but they are drafted by local authorities. Digital Alert Systems, Inc., the New York-based firm that makes the emergency-alert software, said that Pyle first reported the vulnerabilities to the firm in 2019, at which time the firm issued updated software to address the issue. However, Pyle told CNN that subsequent versions of the Digital Alert Systems software were still susceptible to some of the security issues he discovered. “We take all security reports very seriously,” Ed Czarnecki, Digital Alert Systems’ vice president of global and government affairs, told CNN. He added that the firm will examine future software releases for any issues reported by Pyle. “The vast majority of our users have been very good at keeping up with software updates,” Czarnecki said, adding that users can further mitigate the issue by ensuring the device is protected by a firewall. Seeing the breakdown of law enforcement communications in the days before the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol motivated Pyle to dig further into the security of those types of communications, he said.   “It’s a big critical infrastructure problem everyone needs to own,” said Pyle, who is a partner at security firm CYBIR. He will demonstrate his research next week in Las Vegas at DEF CON, one of the world’s biggest hacking conferences. The misuse of emergency alerts can create panic. In 2018, an employee of a Hawaii Emergency Management Agency was supposed to test the alert system but instead sent actual text messages to the cellphones of Hawaiian residents and tourists about a supposed incoming ballistic missile that told them to “SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER.”",Mark Lucero;Ken Pyle;Ed Czarnecki,Emergency Management Agency;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2137;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2137;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,279;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,1212;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF_ENGINEER,444;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,2114;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,596;SCIENCE,290;SCIENCE,1223;TAX_FNCACT_RESEARCHER,290;TAX_FNCACT_RESEARCHER,1223;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1339;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1993;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2038;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2613;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,168;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,168;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,168;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1622;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1622;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,127;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,223;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,995;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1448;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1575;NATURAL_DISASTER_NATURAL_DISASTERS,588;CYBER_ATTACK,155;TAX_FNCACT_HACKER,155;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,45;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,948;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,1769;WB_695_POVERTY,45;WB_695_POVERTY,948;WB_695_POVERTY,1769;TAX_FNCACT_HACKERS,913;AFFECT,868;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,435;TAX_FNCACT_ENGINEER,444;GOV_LOCALGOV,538;MEDIA_MSM,65;MEDIA_MSM,770;MEDIA_MSM,1505;TAX_AIDGROUPS_FEDERAL_EMERGENCY_MANAGEMENT_AGENCY,241;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,241;LEADER,2114;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2114;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2114;SECURITY_SERVICES,2501;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2501;WB_840_JUSTICE,2501;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2501;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,2501;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,2501;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,2501;LEGISLATION,2489;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2489;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,538;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,250;",Washington,621
683,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/middleeast/hamas-israel-gaza-conflict-mime-intl/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here. One of the most important aspects of the weekend’s short but violent conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was what didn’t happen: Hamas’ involvement.     A ceasefire between Israel and the PIJ over Gaza that went into effect at 11:30 p.m. local time (4:30 p.m. ET) Sunday appeared to be holding almost 24 hours later. The conflict led to the death of at least 44 militants and civilians in Gaza, according to information from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Fifteen of the dead were children. Israel insists most of those killed were militants, and that several civilians were killed by failed militant rocket launches.    Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza, expressed support for the PIJ’s actions. But it kept its much larger and more powerful arsenal of rockets out of the equation, while Israel’s military made it clear from the outset they were focusing solely on PIJ targets.    That kept the conflict from spiraling into a larger, more dangerous confrontation, and closer to what happened during the 11-day war in May 2021.     So why not get involved? According to analysts and Israeli officials, one reason is the fact it is still only 15 months since the 2021 conflict that led to considerable damage and death in Gaza. Palestinians there are still rebuilding their homes, and Hamas is rebuilding its arsenal.     The Israeli government also believes its campaign of economic incentives – boosting the number of permits given to Gazans to cross into Israel for work – is succeeding.     Israel and Egypt have imposed a closure on Gaza since 2007, limiting access to the territory via land, air and sea, including tight restrictions on the movement of residents and the flow of goods.      If rockets are fired, Israel closes the border and the thousands of Gazans with permits can’t work in Israel or get paid.     On Monday, a senior Israeli diplomatic official said Hamas was “an enemy not a partner … but there is cooperation we can do, predominantly through Egypt, to improve the situation in Gaza.”   For showing restraint, Hamas will expect to be rewarded.   Lapid’s first big security test   The weekend’s conflict was also the first major military test for interim Prime Minister Yair Lapid. Unlike his predecessor Naftali Bennett, Lapid is not known for his military combat experience. But like US President Joe Biden’s visit last month, it was another moment for Lapid to look like a real prime minister — images Lapid likely hopes Israelis remember as they had to the polls in November.    The conflict also brought about another breakthrough, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale: former prime minister, now opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu met with Lapid on Sunday to receive a security briefing on the operation. It was his first security briefing since leaving power – even though by law it is supposed to be standard practice. Until this weekend, Netanyahu had boycotted the meetings.    After the meeting, Netanyahu said he supported the operation and gave his “full backing to the government, the IDF, and the security forces.”    Parts of Gaza once again lie in rubble and the mourning continues for lost lives, but for everyday Israelis and Gazans, the conflict hasn’t led to a substantial change in the political situation on the ground.      The digest Russia envoy to Iran nuclear talks says they are “moving in right direction”  Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s chief negotiator in Vienna for talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, on Sunday told media, “I cannot guarantee [anything], but the impression is that we are moving in the right direction.” He said there were “minimal” unresolved issues, “just 3 [or] 4.”     Putin, Erdogan agree to begin partial payment in rubles for Russian gas  Bilateral talks in Sochi between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan included an agreement to pay Russia in rubles for partial gas supplies. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the two presidents reached agreements on establishing a financial banking bloc “to enable commercial companies, Russian citizens, to pay during tourist trips and exchange money.”  Iran city reaches 53 degrees Celsius, hottest temperature in the world this year  Abadan, Iran had a high temperature of 53.0° C (127.4° F) Friday – the highest temperature recorded anywhere in the world in 2022, according to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera.       What’s trending   Kuwait: #Wage_rise_is_a_public_demand   The citizens of one of the richest Arab countries are demanding a rise in wages.  Kuwaitis took to Twitter to express their frustration at the country’s economic situation, blaming official corruption and greed for alleged inequality in pay.   Kuwaiti citizens are a minority in the country of 4.2 million, making up just 30% of the population, according to World Population Review. Most rely on government jobs to make a living.   “It’s inconceivable that a rich country like Kuwait that has a small number of people and the strongest currency in the world [wouldn’t raise wages],” tweeted Mohammed Al Huwaishel. “The demands of the people must be met without conditions.”  Many Kuwaitis take government jobs – where pay can be up to 28% higher than the private sector – because they either lack the necessary skills to work in the private sector or because some of those jobs are seen as menial, according to the Middle East Institute.  Due to the benefits offered in government jobs, the private sector finds it difficult to lure Kuwaitis. According to the International Monetary Fund, public wages and benefits account for one-third of the government’s budget. The government set aside $72 billion in spending for its latest budget.   The World Bank warned in December that the government’s wage bill is unsustainable, saying that if the situation continues, the country’s financial reserves will be depleted. The nation has made the least progress among oil-rich Gulf Arab countries to reform its wage bill and has even increased hiring, it said.   Another hashtag on Twitter called on the government to write off citizens’ debt, which is not without precedent. After the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the government wrote off almost all consumer debt.

662,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/dry-lightning-wildfire-california-climate/,"Dry lightning has ignited some of the most destructive and costly wildfires in California history, a new study shows.  Researchers found that over the past few decades, nearly half of the lightning strikes that hit the ground during spring and summer had been dry — there was no rain falling nearby. Dry lightning tends to happen in storms over areas of extreme drought, like the one California has been in for the past several years. The air is so dry that the rain evaporates before it hits the ground. And the conditions that favor dry lightning are becoming more widespread and more frequent as the climate crisis fuel’s the West’s megadrought. Dmitri Kalashnikov, lead author of the paper and a doctoral student at Washington State University, pointed to the wildfires that scorched California in 2020 — particularly the August Complex Fire, the largest wildfire in the state’s history — as the motivation for the research.  The August Complex Fire was originally more than three dozen fires that were sparked by dry lightning. Those fires merged to become the largest in state history, burning more than a million acres in seven counties. California firefighters were exhausted that summer, CNN reported at the time, and they were particularly concerned about the potential for more and more fires sparked by dry lightning.  All of the seven largest fires in California history have occurred in the past five years, and four of those were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire.  “With warming and drying and drier vegetation, it doesn’t take a whole lot of lightning to start wildfires,” Kalashnikov told CNN. “So even if, on the off chance, dry lightning decreases in the future, it just takes one outbreak one day in a year to cause a lot of fire and a lot of damage, if that were to happen.” The study, funded by NASA and published Monday in the journal Environmental Research: Climate, is the first to develop long-term climatology of dry lightning in California, specifically focusing on Central and Northern California, an area where lightning is a significant cause of wildfire.  Dry lightning was found to occur most frequently in July and August, the researchers found, though lower elevation regions tended to see activity peak later in September and October, when vegetation is even drier. Researchers found that around Sacramento, San Francisco, Redwood, Sequoia and Yosemite, lightning sparked nearly 30%, of fires which accounted for nearly 50% of the total burned area.  “That is a lot of fires started by lightning, which are usually more difficult to attack because they tend to be more remote than human caused fires,” Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist and lightning applications manager at Vaisala, told CNN.   Vagasky, who is not involved with the study, said the findings provide “excellent background” for weather forecasting and wildland management communities to better determine the conditions that are favorable for dry lightning to occur in advance.  “This really highlights the importance of understanding when dry lightning can be expected so that crews can be at the ready in the event of fire starting,” he said. “So it’s good to see that there is now a study for this region of the US that shows not just the time of year, but the type of meteorological conditions that appear favorable for dry lightning.”  The research is just the first step, Vagasky said. “When thunderstorms do develop, first responders need to be aware that dry lightning conditions may be possible, but they will also have to be able to quickly respond to areas that are impacted,” he added. Kalashnikov said there are still uncertainties when it comes to lightning research, whether dry lightning will occur more often as the climate changes. But one thing is certain, he said, as the Western drought persists, conditions are much more favorable for dry lightning to take shape. In just the last year alone, dry lightning has sparked deadly and destructive wildfires such as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon that burned more than 400,000 acres. “We know it’s getting hotter and drier — California is becoming hotter and drier,” Kalashnikov said. “So we can say that no matter what the trend in lightning is doing, when lightning happens with a hotter, drier atmosphere and vegetation, it’s just going to lead to more of a risk of these kinds of wildfire outbreaks like we saw in 2020.”",Chris Vagasky,Washington State University;Vaisala;Environmental Research;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2995;WB_1777_FORESTS,2995;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2995;TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,2826;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,2859;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2779;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,865;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2218;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,4807;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,368;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4267;WB_569_HYDROMET_SERVICES,3130;WB_568_CLIMATE_SERVICES,3130;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,709;SCIENCE,135;SCIENCE,2305;SCIENCE,2448;WB_571_CLIMATE_SCIENCE,2069;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,2069;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,4468;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,606;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2022;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4202;WATER_SECURITY,285;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,78;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,767;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,1722;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,4433;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,78;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,767;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,1722;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,4433;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1844;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1844;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1844;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1844;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1844;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1844;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,675;EDUCATION,740;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,740;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,613;WB_137_WATER,3656;WB_137_WATER,3747;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,613;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,613;",San Francisco;Oregon;Sacramento;Nebraska;Klamath;Colorado;California,889
190,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/california-mckinney-fire-wednesday/,"As firefighters battle the raging wildfire scorching a Northern California forest and swallowing homes in its path, some residents forced to flee are left to grapple with the losses and an uncertain future. Klamath River resident Kayla Dailey, pregnant with her third child, spent her due date not prepping for the imminent delivery of her daughter, but fleeing the McKinney Fire, which she says ultimately engulfed her home.  Dailey, her husband Levi, their two young sons, and the family’s roommate Dalton Shute relocated to Northern California from Indiana just 4 months ago. Wildfires were not something the family had encountered before. The blaze, the largest wildfire in California so far this year, broke out Friday afternoon in the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border and grew rapidly over the weekend, fueled by explosive fire weather.  The fire sprinted through dry brush and grass, scorching more than 56,000 acres and forcing thousands to evacuate as the flames advanced on rural Klamath River communities. The fire had zero containment as of Tuesday. However, in a hopeful sign, US Forest Service officials said lower temperatures and higher humidity levels – as well as rain over some areas of the fire – slowed down the fire’s spread and helped firefighters to make good progress Tuesday. “I was really confused at first. I had never seen a forest fire,” explained Dailey. “Things just looked weird – there was this orange cast over the forest – and once I saw smoke rising from fire over top of the mountains, I just panicked.”  The couple and their roommate immediately packed all into their small car, leaving room for little else.  “I could see nothing but smoke and the fire coming down the mountain,” said Dailey, who later learned the wildfire started just 3 miles away before it raced for their home, the flames feasting on their belongings, including everything set aside for the new baby. Now, 4 days past her due date, Dailey has yet another new worry: The nearest hospital has been evacuated and she’s been warned that she will likely need to make a 2-hour trek through the mountains to give birth at a hospital in Medford, Oregon.   It remains unclear how many homes were lost, but forest officials said “numerous” structures were destroyed around the Klamath River community. Four people have been found dead in the fire’s burn area, including two who were in a burned vehicle in a home’s driveway and another two found at different homes along the same road, State Route 96, according to the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office. More than 5,800 people have been evacuated due to the fire, Joel Brumm, a spokesperson for the Klamath National Forest, told CNN.  ‘We don’t even have an address anymore’ Valerie Linfoot and her husband, both retired forest firefighters, lost their home of more than three decades. “We’ve fought fires and seen homes burn up and been in a place of being the firefighters there doing that work, but to have it happen to yourself, it’s just unimaginable,” Linfoot told CNN. “I’m still overwhelmed that we’re the victims of this horrible, horrible convergence of weather and fire, which so many times we’ve seen other people suffer.”  Linfoot was out of town when the fire quickly advanced on her home. Her husband, Chuck, saw the flames approach and packed up and left. He drove to the community hall and looked back, seeing flames flanking their home on both sides. “There’s nothing left. It’s completely burned down to the dirt. It’s just completely gone,” Linfoot said. For Linfoot, the hardest part is thinking about the irreplaceable items that were left behind when her home burned down. “It’s a lot to take on in your mind thinking about those things that you’re never gonna get back,” she said. “I left my wedding rings on my dresser and I’m never gonna get those back. I have been married 31 years and those are the rings that were put on my finger the day I said yes. And they’re gone forever.” Also lost in the fire were the ashes of Linfoot’s mother and grandmother, as well as her children’s baby photographs. “We lost one of our sons about 10 years ago in a motorcycle accident. So the idea of not having any pictures…” she said. Linfoot has found comfort in the sense of community in Klamath River, and staying close with friends who are also dealing with the same losses. But she worries for her tightly knit community. “It’s a small community and this is absolutely devastating to Klamath River,” she said. “I don’t know how they’re gonna recover. None of us are rich people. We’re all hardworking and resilient people, but most people that were down there are middle class, regular working folks or retirees.” She said her family is exploring their options, but don’t think they will be able to rebuild. The Linfoots set up a GoFundMe page to help them with recovery and rebuilding. “It’s hard to convey to somebody what it’s like to know that you have nothing. One of the first things my husband said to me is, ‘we don’t even have an address anymore,’” Linfoot said.  Shute, the Dailey’s friend and roommate, is still struggling to process the situation. “It still doesn’t feel real,” said Shute, who lost his mom to a house fire when he was 6 years old. “I feel that sort of emptiness I felt when I was a child.” Despite the challenges they’ve faced, Shute and his roommates are confident that they will rebound, and are grateful for the help being offered by the community. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help him find a new home. “We’re definitely not going to let this set us back,” Shute said. “Right now we’re learning to take it one day at a time and we’ll eventually be in a good place again.”",Valerie Linfoot;Valerie Linfoot;Joel Brumm;Dalton Shute;Kayla Dailey,Us Forest Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"SOC_TRAFFICACCIDENT,4405;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,2270;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,2865;NATURAL_DISASTER_FOREST_FIRE,1640;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,86;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,943;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1313;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1635;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1725;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2461;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2958;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3097;WB_1777_FORESTS,86;WB_1777_FORESTS,943;WB_1777_FORESTS,1313;WB_1777_FORESTS,1635;WB_1777_FORESTS,1725;WB_1777_FORESTS,2461;WB_1777_FORESTS,2958;WB_1777_FORESTS,3097;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,86;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,943;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1313;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1635;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1725;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2461;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2958;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3097;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,86;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,943;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1313;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1635;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1725;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2461;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2958;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3097;MANMADE_DISASTER_HOUSE_FIRE,5545;RURAL,1175;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1876;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,47;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,837;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2021;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,47;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,837;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2021;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,2911;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,293;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,5620;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,200;BORDER,976;GENERAL_HEALTH,2251;GENERAL_HEALTH,2381;MEDICAL,2251;MEDICAL,2381;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,2251;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,2381;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2251;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2381;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,2810;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2810;WB_1979_NATURAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT,1784;WB_1979_NATURAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT,2353;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,1784;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,2353;WB_1986_MOUNTAINS,1784;WB_1986_MOUNTAINS,2353;KILL,2594;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,2594;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2594;ARMEDCONFLICT,27;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,748;CRISISLEX_C05_NEED_OF_SHELTERS,149;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,3371;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,3371;AFFECT,1143;EVACUATION,1143;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2228;DISASTER_FIRE,1052;DISASTER_FIRE,1226;DISASTER_FIRE,1421;DISASTER_FIRE,1442;DISASTER_FIRE,1949;DISASTER_FIRE,2606;DISASTER_FIRE,2881;DISASTER_FIRE,3521;DISASTER_FIRE,4253;DISASTER_FIRE,4506;ECON_MIDDLECLASS,4998;WB_695_POVERTY,4998;WB_1153_MIDDLE_CLASS,4998;WB_1152_ECONOMIC_AND_SOCIAL_MOBILITY,4998;WB_707_POVERTY_MEASUREMENT_AND_ANALYSIS,4998;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1331;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2471;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,4326;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,20;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1471;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3110;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3229;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,2164;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,4331;",Indiana;Siskiyou County;Oregon;Klamath;California,1250
436,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/florida-dna-case-1983/,"Two men serving life sentences for murder in a Florida prison have been linked to two other murders with the help of newly discovered DNA samples, which led to the exoneration of another man who wrongfully served 37 years in prison for the rape and murder of Barbara Grams in 1983. Amos Robinson and Abron Scott allegedly raped and murdered 19-year-old  Grams, whose beaten body was found behind a dental office in Tampa Heights on August 18, 1983, Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren said during a news conference Thursday after he was suspended as the state attorney by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his stance against criminalizing abortion providers.  A grand jury indicted Robinson and Scott Thursday for the rape and murder of Linda Lansen, whose beaten body was found in Town and Country in July 1983 in bushes with a gunshot wound to the head, Warren said.  “These two men not only robbed me, but they robbed a 7-year-old little girl of her mother,” said Linda Sheffield, Lansen’s niece, during Thursday’s news conference.  “When they’re initially murdered, the shock is there, but 39 years later the shock is no longer there,” she said. “But the void stays, and the pain stays and the crying stays. It doesn’t go away.” Robinson and Scott are also subjects of other cold case investigations from the same time period in the Tampa Bay area, Warren said. “We now know that these two men carried out a sinister spree of rape and murder in Tampa Bay in the summer and fall of 1983,” Warren said. It is unclear if Robinson and Scott have attorneys at this time. DNA evidence leads to exoneration and new conviction In 2018, Warren’s office created a Conviction Review Unit to help overturn and prevent wrongful convictions. Two years later, Robert DuBoise, who spent 37 years in prison for Grams’ rape and murder, was exonerated. “Our investigation found DNA evidence that established Robert did not murder Barbara Grams; however, that DNA evidence did provide new leads and launched a fresh investigation,” Warren said.  The DNA sample that did not contain material from DuBoise was run through a national database containing DNA samples of convicted felons and led investigators to Scott and Robinson, who were already serving life sentences in a Florida prison for a murder they committed in Pinellas County in October of 1983, Warren said.  With that information, investigators were able to build a case for Grams’ murder and open a cold case investigation into Lansen’s murder. At the time of DuBoise’s trial, there wasn’t any physical or circumstantial evidence connecting DuBoise to the attack, according to The Florida Innocence Project.  Before his conviction, he was transported to Hillsborough County Jail. A jailhouse informant who spoke with DuBoise later testified falsely that DuBoise had confessed to the crime during his jail stay, The Florida Innocence Project said. “I am sad for the families who have waited so long to get true closure,” DuBoise told CNN Friday. “I spent 37 years imprisoned for a crime I was totally innocent. This is what happens when the police focus on the wrong person, make up evidence to fit their theory and don’t investigate to find the truth. Lives are ruined and communities are less safe.” ",Abron Scott;Andrew Warren;Amos Robinson;Ron Desantis;Linda Lansen;Linda Sheffield;Robert Duboise;Robert Duboise,Cnn;Cnn,"ARREST,3101;ARREST,3227;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,3101;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,3227;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,3101;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,3227;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2392;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2392;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,2392;WB_2945_DATABASE,2392;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2392;WOUND,1090;BAN,649;LEADER,738;LEADER,859;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,738;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,859;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,738;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,859;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,738;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,859;SOC_GENERALCRIME,44;SOC_GENERALCRIME,248;SOC_GENERALCRIME,985;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1707;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2086;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2182;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2550;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2797;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2849;IDEOLOGY,2013;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,1842;KILL,329;KILL,1306;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,3211;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,3402;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,1147;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,1166;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,64;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,226;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,2063;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,2537;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,64;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,226;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,2063;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,2537;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,64;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,226;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2063;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2537;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,64;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,226;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2063;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2537;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,64;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,226;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2063;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2537;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ABRON,296;TRIAL,485;TRIAL,583;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,485;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,583;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2967;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2455;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2755;TAX_FNCACT_FELONS,2435;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,561;SECURITY_SERVICES,3463;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,3463;RAPE,239;RAPE,976;RAPE,1698;RAPE,2077;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,239;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,976;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1698;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,2077;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1537;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1537;WB_840_JUSTICE,1537;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1537;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1537;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1537;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1537;WB_135_TRANSPORT,3058;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,376;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1031;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,192;CLOSURE,3342;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,1318;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,1349;WB_695_POVERTY,1318;WB_695_POVERTY,1349;",Pinellas County;Florida;Hillsborough County;Tampa,689
609,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/donald-trump-january-6-justice-department-probe/,"Liz Cheney has posed the question with which America may have to wrestle for months to come: if there is evidence that ex-President Donald Trump committed crimes in seeking to overturn the 2020 election, what message will it send if he’s not charged? The Wyoming representative, who serves as the vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021,  issued what was effectively a challenge to the Justice Department as CNN exclusively reported on Thursday that Trump’s lawyers are in talks with its prosecutors – in the most concrete step yet toward the former commander-in-chief. The news was the latest sign that the department, criticized for months for moving too slowly to investigate Trump’s election stealing effort and his incitement of the mob that invaded the US Capitol, is moving with speed and broadening its scope – though there remains no indication when or even if the former President will be charged in the Justice Department’s probe. Cheney argued in an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt taped Wednesday that if the Justice Department failed to act in the face of evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it would be disastrous to the idea of America itself. “Understanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute – how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws?,” said Cheney, one of two Republicans on the panel.   CNN senior legal analyst Preet Bharara said that the fact that Trump’s lawyers are already in communication with the investigation suggests they believe he may have some significant exposure down the line. “Actively engaging suggests to me that the lawyers think that there is some jeopardy here and they should engage sooner rather than later,” Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Bharara cautioned that the investigation could last a long time and that a decision “about whether or not to charge Donald Trump” could occur many months from now. Learning what Trump was saying and thinking as his mob smashed its way into the US Capitol and during his prior schemes designed to overturn his election loss could help establish whether the ex-President acted with corrupt intent and could be at risk of being criminally charged.  More immediately, the dialogue with Trump’s lawyers could also be the curtain raiser to what may well be a critical legal fight over the extent to which Trump – as an ex-President – can assert executive privilege over conversations and advice he received while in office. Such a case could go all the way to the Supreme Court and in itself break new legal ground since there is little litigation on the issue concerning out-of-office presidents. Executive privilege is the custom under which private conversations and advice given to a president can remain private, especially from Congress, under the doctrine of separation of powers. A long legal duel  The potential legal battle that Trump’s often risible privilege claims may spark could push the Justice Department investigation into the middle of the ex-President’s likely 2024 campaign. This would risk yet another national political conflagration on top of many ignited by the 45th President. But more broadly, the latest news about the Justice Department inquiry shows that there is an aggressive criminal probe that is narrowing in on a former President of the United States – a historical watershed – after an administration that is still tearing at the guardrails of the democratic system even out of office. This does not necessarily mean that Trump will be charged. A criminal investigation requires a far higher level of proof than the House select committee, which has painted a damning picture of Trump’s actions ahead of the Capitol insurrection. And Trump has made a life’s work of escaping legal scrapes and attempts to enforce accountability. In his presidency alone, he wriggled free from the Russia investigation. He was the first President to be impeached twice by the House, although he wasn’t convicted in Senate trials or barred from future federal office. Still, according to the new CNN report, Trump’s team has warned him there may be indictments resulting from the grand jury investigation. And sources say the former President has asked his advisers whether he is in personal legal jeopardy. New visibility into aggressive DOJ investigation  Kimberly Wehle, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the contacts between Trump’s lawyers and prosecutors pointed to a legal joust over the scope of executive privilege. “I think that Donald Trump is going to lose that battle, but the fact that his lawyers are engaging in this and telling him that he better beware, indictments could come, I think is very serious news for the former President but very good news for democracy, the rule of law and the Constitution,” Wehle said. The latest revelations about the grand jury probe reinforce signs that the Justice Department is acting with speed and expansive scope to investigate the insurrection following months of complaints – even from members of the House select committee – that it did not appear to be that active. This in turn raises the possibility that yet another significant period of national trauma caused by Trump could lie ahead. The former President has already claimed that the Biden administration is weaponizing the Justice Department to pursue its political enemies – a charge many critics leveled against him while he was still president. Trump would be sure to react to any signs that he is a target of the investigation or the possible indictments of those around him by claiming that he is being victimized by a politicized investigation. Given his hold over his supporters, and a record of inciting violence, political tensions could become acute.  All of this will sharpen the dilemma that Attorney General Merrick Garland would face if the evidence from the criminal probe suggests a prosecution is merited. Indicting a former President – especially one running for the White House again – would incite a political storm. This must raise the question of whether targeting Trump would be in the broader national interest outside the criminal context. At the same time, failing to pursue an ex-President accused of helping to foment a coup attempt could create an equally dangerous precedent and send a signal to future aberrant Presidents.   Trump team discussed potential defense strategies  The most significant news yet about the Justice Department criminal probe follows unmistakable signs of a comprehensive and quickening investigation. The department has, for instance, subpoenaed former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and ex-deputy counsel Patrick Philbin.  Last week, it emerged that two of former Vice President Mike Pence’s most senior aides, former chief of staff Marc Short and former counsel Greg Jacob, have already spoken to the grand jury. Investigators recently obtained a second warrant to search the cellphone of conservative lawyer John Eastman, one of the key figures in pushing Pence to overturn the 2020 election by rejecting electors from important swing states. Federal investigators in June carried out a pre-dawn search of the home of former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times in a deposition to the House select committee.  In the latest reporting by CNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Kara Scannell, Gabby Orr and Kristen Holmes, sources revealed that some members of Trump’s legal team discussed possible defense strategies on at least two occasions in recent months. This comes as they await developments not solely in the Justice Department investigation but in a separate probe by officials in Georgia into Trump’s efforts to overturn Biden’s election victory in the crucial state in 2020. Trump has grilled his attorneys on whether they actually believe he will face formal charges, but he has expressed skepticism that he will be indicted, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. The CNN team also reveals that Trump has ignored advice from advisers to avoid speaking to former and current aides who have become entangled in the House select committee probe and could be drawn in by the criminal investigation. When it comes to the issue of executive privilege, historical precedent could work against the former President. During the Watergate scandal, then-President Richard Nixon asserted executive privilege to try to prevent the handover of incriminating audio tapes. But in a ruling that could be significant in Trump’s case, the Supreme Court said that executive privilege could not be used to thwart the administration of criminal justice.  The House January 6 committee did not litigate the question of Cipollone’s reluctance to talk about certain conversations with Trump on the basis of executive privilege. It is racing against a ticking clock since it is likely to be disbanded by pro-Trump Republicans in the House if control of the chamber changes after the midterm elections in November. But the Justice Department has the luxury of more time to conduct a legal fight. And the possibility of a prolonged investigation is one reason many observers believe Trump is leaning toward an early announcement of a 2024 presidential campaign, which would enable him to rile up his supporters by arguing that the investigation is a politicized attempt by the Biden administration to keep him from reclaiming the White House.",Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Katelyn

457,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/joe-biden-covid-19-negative/,"President Joe Biden was officially cleared to emerge from isolation Sunday after a second negative Covid-19 test, his physician announced.  “This morning, the president’s SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing was negative for a second consecutive day,” presidential physician Kevin O’Connor wrote in a letter Sunday. “He will safely return to public engagement and presidential travel.” Biden tested negative on an antigen test Saturday as well, but remained in isolation until Sunday morning before departing for Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Departing the White House for Rehoboth Beach, the President told reporters he was “feeling good,” saying, “After 18 days, I’m clear!” Biden had not left the White House since initially testing positive for Covid-19 on July 21. After taking a five-day course of Pfizer’s antiviral drug, Paxlovid, he tested positive for a rebound case of Covid-19 last Saturday and resumed isolation. There are currently no events on his public schedule for the weekend. During isolation, the President has participated virtually in public events from the White House residence. On two occasions, he delivered socially distanced remarks to a restricted pool from the Blue Room balcony, announcing a successful strike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri Monday and signing two bills cracking down on Covid-19 relief fraud Friday. The President and first lady Jill Biden are scheduled to travel on Monday to visit Kentucky after deadly floods in the eastern part of the state killed dozens of people and devastated the area. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “People with recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms or a new positive viral test after having tested negative should restart isolation and isolate again for at least 5 days.” During Biden’s first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough, according to his doctor. The five-day course of Paxlovid the President completed requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. The CDC issued a health alert to doctors on May 24 advising that Covid-19 symptoms sometimes come back, and that may just be how the infection plays out in some people, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated or treated with medications such as Paxlovid. The CDC said that most rebound cases involve mild disease and that there have been no reports of serious illness. Biden is fully vaccinated and received two booster shots. He received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination in March.

94,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/tech/electronic-waste-explainer/,"If you have one or more drawers filled with old gadgets and wires, you’re not alone. Decades of the tech sector’s pressure to “innovate or die” have led to a long list of useful and flashy household tech products, but many of these same devices also have a need to be replaced at almost the same rapid rate that new technology emerges.  The result of this so-called planned obsolescence, combined with a limited number of options to repair older devices over the years, is a tsunami of electronic waste, also known as e-waste. And the fallout from it extends far beyond the headache of figuring out what to do with the clutter tucked away inside your home. “Planned obsolescence just makes it worse. People now expect to get a new computer every three or four years, a new phone every two years,” said Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network, a Seattle-based e-waste watchdog group. “It’s a mountain that just keeps growing.”   The most recent United Nation’s data indicates the world generated a staggering 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste in 2019, and only 17.4% of that was recycled. The burden and harms of e-waste often fall to those in developing countries. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that an “undetermined amount of used electronics is shipped from the United States and other developed countries to developing countries that lack the capacity to reject imports or to handle these materials appropriately.” The World Health Organization (WHO) warned last year that the disposal and processing of soaring e-waste can cause a range of “adverse child health impacts,” including changes in lung function, DNA damage and increased risk of some chronic illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease later in life.  Moreover, there are more than 18 million children and adolescents “actively engaged” in the informal e-waste processing industry, the WHO warned. Children and adolescents are often used to scour through mountains of e-waste in search of valuable materials such as copper and gold “because their small hands are more dexterous than those of adults,” the WHO said. The issue of e-waste is “all about environmental justice at the global level,” Puckett said. “It’s about keeping the rich countries from dumping their waste and dirty technologies on developing countries.” The growing environmental crisis is now catching the attention of lawmakers from Europe to the United States, as well as communities in the developing nations where e-waste has historically been offshored. EU officials last month approved a new law requiring all phones and electronics to use a standard, brand-agnostic charger, with the potential to limit how many different wires the average consumer needs to own. Three progressive American lawmakers urged in a letter for the US to follow suit.   Sens. Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders said the novel EU policy “has the potential to significantly reduce e-waste and help consumers who are tired of having to rummage through junk drawers full of tangled chargers to find a compatible one, or buy a new one,” in a letter addressed to the US Commerce secretary. The senators alluded to the bipartisan hot topic of “taking on powerful technology companies” in the interest of consumers and the environment. For now, though, regulation around e-waste exists primarily at the state level and there are few signs of federal policy moving forward in the near future. In its absence, the onus continues to be on consumers – and companies – to take initiative and find better ways to deal with old electronics.  What consumers and companies can do about it When Corey Dehmey worked in corporate IT departments, he had to figure out what to do with hundreds of company computers that were no longer up to date. Now, as executive director of non-profit Sustainable Electronics Recycling International (SERI), he is part of a group trying to tackle the e-waste crisis by bolstering cooperation between the government, private sector and consumers.  “E-waste is the result of not planning for the product throughout its lifecycle,” Dehmey said. “We’re just reacting to a problem we created years ago. And so if we want to get in front of this thing, we have to think about these things on the front end – what we’re designing and what we as consumers are purchasing as well.” To do that, SERI introduced and oversees its own certification standards for e-waste recycling that makes sure facilities are properly disposing of e-waste. It also hosts events for businesses and other stakeholders and engages in advocacy work to pressure companies and governments to take more sustainable approaches to developing electronics.  “We’ve got to figure out ways to use [an electronic device] longer, repair it, reuse it,” Dehmey said, noting this will require mindset shifts from both consumers and companies.  In recent months, there has been some cause for optimism on this front. The surge in e-waste has led to increased pressure on manufacturers to ease restrictions on fixing devices for individuals and independent repair shops in a push known as the “right to repair” movement. President Joe Biden last year passed an executive order that directed the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules requiring companies to allow DIY repairs, and the FTC vowed to “root out” illegal repair restrictions. Now, a handful of tech companies have launched initiatives to help with repairing old gadgets. Earlier this year, Apple and Samsung launched their self-service repair stores, offering parts for users seeking do-it-yourself fixes for their smartphones. Google similarly promised parts for repairing Pixel phones will be available to the public later this year. Various coalitions have also emerged in recent years to give consumers the option to responsibly dispose of their devices. Puckett helped launch the e-waste recycling initiative e-Stewards, for example, which certifies and audits electronics recyclers to make sure they are properly disposing of e-waste using “very rigorous standards.”  With this tool, consumers can look up nearby recycling centers. SERI also offers an online tool to find a certified recycling center.  Jeff Seibert, the chief provocateur (yes, that’s his real title) at SERI, also recommends consumers check with their local municipality to see if they have a designated plan for recycling e-waste. A handful of US retailers, including Staples and Best Buy, also have programs that let consumers bring in e-waste for recycling in the absence of broader infrastructure. Other companies, including Apple, have programs to offer credits or free recycling in exchange for trading in used gadgets. Before opting to donate or recycle used electronics, the EPA recommends considering upgrading the hardware or software of a computer instead of buying a brand new product. If you do decide to recycle, the EPA urges consumers to remove any batteries that may need to be recycled separately. The agency says that recycling one million laptops saves the energy equivalent of the electricity used by more than 3,500 US homes in a year. For every one million cell phones that are recycled, the agency says 35,000 pounds of copper, 772 pounds of silver, 75 pounds of gold and 33 pounds of palladium can be recovered. Apart from these options, Seibert simply urges consumers to start thinking about electronics like we think about cars: we don’t trash our vehicles when we need new tires or if the windshield cracks.  “Everybody wants to do the right thing,” Seibert said. “So we’ve got to give them the resources to be able to do that, and that’s still a work in progress.”",Ed Markey;Elizabeth Warren;Joe Biden;Jim Puckett;Westmoreland Cleanways;Jeff Seibert;Corey Dehmey;Bernie Sanders,Google;World Health Organization;Cnn;Us Environmental Protection Agency;United States;United States;Samsung;Basel Action Network;Sustainable Electronics Recycling International;Best Buy,"TAX_FNCACT_SENATORS,3315;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1935;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1655;TAX_DISEASE_HEADACHE,573;KILL,140;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,140;SOC_TECHNOLOGYSECTOR,113;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2928;ACT_YIELD,5131;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,5251;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1279;WB_2936_GOLD,2082;WB_2936_GOLD,7455;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2075;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,7429;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,2075;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,7429;WB_2934_COPPER,2075;WB_2934_COPPER,7429;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,2075;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,7429;WB_1434_HEART_DISEASE,1803;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,4126;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,4126;SOC_EMERGINGTECH,320;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,805;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,3952;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,805;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3952;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1803;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1803;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2221;WB_840_JUSTICE,2221;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,796;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,3943;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,5291;TAX_DISEASE_DUMPING,2306;EPU_CATS_TRADE_POLICY,2306;LEADER,2563;LEADER,2938;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,2563;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,2938;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2563;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2938;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,2563;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,2938;WB_2937_SILVER,7443;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,1662;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1662;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1662;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,1778;WB_1406_DISEASES,1778;WB_1431_CANCER,1778;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,1778;NATURAL_DISASTER_TSUNAMI,475;USPEC_POLICY1,3062;USPEC_POLICY1,3563;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3062;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3563;ALLIANCE,5977;ECON_DEVELOPMENTORGS_WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION,1550;TAX_AIDGROUPS_WORLD_HEALTH_ORGANIZATION,1550;GENERAL_HEALTH,1537;GENERAL_HEALTH,1662;MEDICAL,1537;MEDICAL,1662;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,6454;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,5240;WB_1979_NATURAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT,887;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,887;WB_1986_MOUNTAINS,887;WB_698_TRADE,5329;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,3474;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,2371;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2708;LEGISLATION,2738;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2738;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1720;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1261;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2213;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2513;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1261;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2213;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2513;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1861;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1962;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,3301;",India;New Delhi;American;United States,1528

424,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/ohio-four-people-fatally-shot/,"Four people were fatally shot Friday at multiple sites in a small Ohio town just north of Dayton, and police are searching for a man who is possibly connected to the shootings. Stephen Marlow, a “person of interest,” is likely armed and dangerous, Butler Township Police Chief John Porter said at a media briefing.  “Stephen Marlow remains the primary suspect,” Butler Township Police said in a statement Saturday via Facebook. “We have no current information to make us believe others were involved in these horrific acts.” “Following the shootings, it appears Stephen Marlow drove to Interstate 70 and headed west,” the statement added. “At this time, we believe that he has left Ohio. Law enforcement agencies in multiple states have been made aware of this and are on high alert.” Earlier, FBI said Marlow has ties to Lexington, Kentucky, Indianapolis and Chicago and may be in one of those cities.  Porter said Marlow is 5’11” and about 160 pounds, with brown hair. Authorities believe Marlow, 39, was wearing shorts and a yellow T-shirt and fled in a white 2007 Ford Edge. Authorities have asked anyone with information to contact the FBI. They said Marlow should not be approached.  Police responded to a report of shots fired just before noon Friday, Porter said, and the four victims died at the scenes. “This is the first violent crime in this neighborhood in recent memory,” Porter said. “We are working to determine if there was any motive to this horrible tragedy or if mental illness played any role.”  Wendy Chapman, a neighbor of one victim, told CNN affiliate WKEF the neighborhood is a quiet place. “I would have never, even in this neighborhood, I would never expect anything, never,” Chapman told the Dayton station. Police do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the neighborhood but have deployed additional crews and the Dayton Police Bomb Squad out of an abundance of caution, Porter said. Porter said people should call the police dispatch if they have information on Marlow’s whereabouts or see the Ford Edge.  Butler Township is a town of just under 8,000 residents about 9 miles north of Dayton.

506,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/05/europe/ukraine-grain-hunger-crisis-world-intl,"As the Razoni left the Ukrainian port of Odesa on Monday with the first shipment of grain since the early days of Russia’s war in Ukraine, there were sighs of relief from Somalia to Turkey, Indonesia and China, given how reliant these countries have been on Ukrainian grain to meet their daily needs.  Millions of people have been pushed into hunger as the Russian blockade fueled soaring grain commodity prices, which reached record highs this year as more than 20 million metric tons of Ukrainian wheat and corn remained trapped in Odesa.  But even as the UN-brokered agreement to lift the blockade has eased grain prices, experts say the belated shipments from Ukraine are no quick fix to the crisis, accelerated by years of pandemic-related disruptions, the climate crisis, conflict, food export restrictions and spiraling costs.  All these interacting factors “are going to remain for some time,” Laura Wellesley, a senior research fellow at think tank Chatham House’s environment and society program, told CNN. “It may be that we see peaks in food prices again, and peaks in food insecurity, but certainly not a resolution of the situation anytime soon.”  Global hunger has increased massively, from 135 million people acutely food insecure in 2019 to 345 million in 2022, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). It includes “50 million people in 45 countries that are knocking on famine’s door,” David Beasley, WFP’s executive director, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 20, as he called on other donor countries, like Gulf nations, to step in an “avert catastrophe.”    Today’s crisis is far worse than the previous food price spikes of 2007 to 2008 and 2010 to 2012, which both fueled riots around the world, including revolutions in the Middle East.   Food security experts have warned of huge geopolitical risk if action is not taken. This year has already witnessed political destabilization in “Sri Lanka, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, riots and protests taking place in Kenya, Peru, Pakistan, Indonesia … these are only signs things to come is going to get worse,” Beasley said.      Hunger hotspots   In the Horn of Africa, a four-year drought has led to food insecurity and starvation, according to aid groups. Somalian health facilities are seeing record levels of malnutrition following years of failed rainy seasons, a doubling of wheat prices and the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.   Ijabu Hassan lost three children to malnutrition this year, telling CNN that her 2-year-old daughter collapsed and died on their trek to the capital, Mogadishu, to seek help. “I cried so much,” she said, “I lost consciousness.”   As desperate parents like Hassan seek reprieve, the UN estimates 7 million people — or over half of Somalia’s population — simply do not have enough to eat.   Meanwhile, Afghans have seen their lives go from bad to worse since the Taliban seized power in 2021. After the United States’ hasty withdrawal from the country last August, Washington and its allies cut off international funding to the country, which has run heavily on aid for years, and froze about $7 billion of the country’s foreign reserves.  Afghanistan’s economic crisis has loomed for years, the result of poverty, conflict and drought. But this year, as below average harvests led to unprecedented levels of hunger across the country, long lines for aid have become ubiquitous even in the capital Kabul’s middle-class neighborhoods.   Longstanding conflict in countries like Somalia and Afghanistan has impacted people’s ability to access food, and the climate crisis is only worsening the situation. Droughts in main crop-producing regions, like Europe and North America, have pushed food prices upwards.   Extreme weather across parts of North Africa is a chilling reminder that, blockade or no blockade, food supply here is highly insecure anyway. The region is dependent on wheat from Europe, especially Ukraine. Tunisia, for example, gets nearly half its wheat from the country to make its daily bread.   Data from EarthDaily Analytics, obtained using satellite imagery, shows just how hard it is for some nations here to cover any of the gap themselves. Looking at crop cover in Morocco, the images suggest a “catastrophic wheat season” in the country, with output far lower than in recent years, because of a drought that began there at the end of 2021 and continued into early this year.  Morocco gets a fifth of its wheat from Ukraine and a larger 40% from France, according to Mickael Attia, crop analyst for EarthDaily Analytics.   “The current drought in North Africa, specifically Morocco, is profoundly impacting their ability to produce their own crops, not to mention that in the past, Ukraine was one of the largest exporters of food to the country. The cost to replace that is very high and a struggle,” Attia told CNN.  “The country needs the import for structural reasons – every year national consumption is far higher than production – and because the country is regularly exposed to massive weather events, drought and climate change will make things worse in the future.”  Ukraine’s wheat production, too, is expected to be 40% lower than last year’s, as its fields are impacted by the war; fertilizer and pesticides are harder to get; but also because of an early spring cold pattern and dryness in the country’s west, Attia said, adding that the impacts could last well into next year.  “If Ukrainian grains are partially, physically missing because of low production and difficulties in exporting then, this will lead to greater food insecurity this year and next,” he said.  Other major wheat exporters have also been hit hard by extreme weather exacerbated by climate change. France too should produce 8% less wheat than last year, Attia said. “May was dry in most of Europe, and crazy hot in Western Europe, impacting crops from France and Spain, especially,” Attia said. “June was also a dry and hot month in most of Europe, and accelerated the decrease in crops in France, Spain and Romania.”  Pandemic and protectionism    Meanwhile, many countries’ efforts to alleviate food insecurity were undone in the pandemic. It plunged the global economy into recession in 2020, upending supply chains and causing employment and transport problems. Governments began to face inflationary pressure and global food prices began to soar as production disruption and high demand from countries like China were “really tightening that balance between supply and demand and pushing up prices,” said Wellesley, from Chatham House.  Economies of poorer countries have been left in tatters while middle income nations have incurred large debts, limiting their governments’ ability to offer social safety nets and provisions that would help the most vulnerable through this food supply crisis, she added.   In Peru and Brazil, people working in the large informal jobs sector lost their savings and earning power during the pandemic’s lockdowns. “So these people moved from middle classes to poor… in Brazil the number of people living in severe food insecurity is extremely high,” Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told CNN.   In 2021, a record 36% of Brazilians were at risk of going hungry, surpassing the world average for the first time, according to the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), a Brazilian academic institution, which analyzed Gallup data.    The war has brought home just how many people and countries have come to rely on a complex and globalized commodities system. Europe’s dependency on Russian gas has exposed its vulnerabilities. While countries like Turkey, Egypt, Somalia, Congo and Tanzania are some of the most dependent on Ukrainian and Russian wheat, nations like Eritrea bought the grain exclusively from the two nations in 2021.   Analysts suggest the supply chain crisis might lead to more localized or regional sourcing strategies – but that might take a while.   “Let me give you an example – Africa uses 3% of the fertilizers in the world,” Torero said, yet Dangote’s fertilizer plant in Nigeria sends 95.5% of its product to Latin America. “Nothing stays in Africa. It is not that (the) Dangote plant does not want to export in Africa, it’s (because) there are too many barriers to export (to other parts of) Africa,” he said, adding that the infrastructure was poor and the risk high.   Going the other way and imposing protectionist policies is also problematic. As food prices exploded following Russia’s invasion, countries began restricting exports. India, the world’s largest producer of sugar, limited sugar exports to 10 million tons and banned wheat exports. Today, more than 20 countries have some sort of export restrictions in place, dashing hopes that these items might help alleviate hunger elsewhere.   “That has an immediate effect of pushing up prices, but over time, it also is kind of eroding trust and predictability in the global market,” Wellesley said.   Then there is the issue of fertilizer prices that remain high because it is energy intensive to produce and Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of its key components: urea, potash and phosphate.   Some analysts warn that as usage of fertilizer goes down, we will see smaller yields in 2023. And while the main concern has rested on grain supplies, some worry that the production of rice, a cornerstone of many diets in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, could take a hit amid high fertilizer costs.   Even if there are currently high inventories of rice, protectionism and people turning to rice as a substitute for wheat could impact prices. “Sub-Saharan Africa imports the most rice in the world, so if the price of rice goes up, then the most vulnerable countries will be substantially affected,” Torero of the FAO said.    The Razoni, a Sierre Leone-registered ship currently en route to Lebanon, is carrying around 26,500 metric tons of corn. “To meet 2021 August shipment levels, we’d have to see seven of those ships happen every single day for things to actually get back to where we were,” Jonathan Haines, a senior analyst at commodity data group Gro Intelligence, told CNN. There is a lot of uncertainty if that can happen, but flow is undoubtably “going to really pick up,” he added. The Ukrainian government and the Turkish Defense Ministry said three more ships were expected to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Friday laden with grain. As and when wheat prices drop to pre-war levels, Torero worries that the return of Ukrainian and Russian grain on the markets could further reduce wheat prices and in the process impoverish poor farmers, who shouldered high fertilizer and energy costs to plant their crops.  Just as the food crisis has had wide and varying impacts on people, the solutions are complex and multifaceted. These include improvements in how fertilizers are used, investments in social safety nets, decoupling food production from fossil fuel dependence while slashing greenhouse gas emissions, and a push to make the agricultural sector more resilient to global shocks by diversifying production and trade relationships, experts say.    “These all seem like things to tackle another day given the severity of the current situation. They are not,” Wellesley said. “They are problems contributing to today’s situation (and) will recur over the years to come – particularly as climate impacts continue to worsen.”  ",Jonathan

451,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/ohio-quadruple-murders-suspect-arrested/,"A suspect in the shooting deaths of four people at multiple sites outside of Dayton, Ohio, has been arrested, police said.  Stephen Marlow was taken into custody Saturday night by police in Lawrence, Kansas, Butler Township Police Chief John Porter said at a news conference. Marlow was wanted in connection with the Friday shootings in Butler Township, a small town north of Dayton. The arrest comes a day after the victims were found at multiple crime scenes. A motive for the shootings is still unclear.  Lawrence police “had reason to believe” Marlow was in their city and launched a city-wide search for the suspect, the Lawrence Police Department said in a statement.  A Lawrence police officer called for additional personnel after noticing a vehicle matching the description of the car the suspect was believed to be driving, according to the statement. As the officers were on the way, the vehicle turned into a parking lot and Marlow stepped out, Lawrence police said. After he exited the car, police arrested him, the statement said.   Authorities had described Marlow as likely armed and dangerous. “Stephen Marlow remains the primary suspect,” Butler Township Police said in a Facebook statement Saturday. “We have no current information to make us believe others were involved in these horrific acts.” “Following the shootings, it appears Stephen Marlow drove to Interstate 70 and headed west,” the statement added, noting they believed he had left Ohio. Law enforcement agencies in multiple states have been made aware of this and are on high alert.”  Butler Township is about 640 miles from Lawrence, Kansas.  Police responded to a report of shots fired just before noon Friday, Porter said, and the four victims died at the scenes. “This is the first violent crime in this neighborhood in recent memory,” Porter said. “We are working to determine if there was any motive to this horrible tragedy or if mental illness played any role.”  Wendy Chapman, a neighbor of one victim, told CNN affiliate WKEF the neighborhood is a quiet place. “I would have never, even in this neighborhood, I would never expect anything, never,” Chapman told the Dayton station. Butler Township is a town of just under 8,000 residents about nine miles north of Dayton. In the neighboring city of Vandalia, authorities increased the number of officers on patrol following the shooting, Mayor Richard Herbst said in a Facebook post. The city also canceled outdoor activities and closed recreation facilities “as a precaution,” the mayor said, noting that there were no “specific threats against City facilities.”  CNN’s Zenebou Sylla, Liam Reilly and Samantha Beech also contributed to this story",Wendy Chapman;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Zenebou Sylla;John Porter,Butler Township Police;Butler Township Police;Butler Township Police;Facebook;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1609;KILL,37;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,544;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,502;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,502;WB_840_JUSTICE,502;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,502;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,502;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,502;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,502;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1751;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE_CHIEF,257;TAX_DISEASE_MENTAL_ILLNESS,1629;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,433;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,749;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,433;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,749;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,433;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,749;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,573;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1479;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,235;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,364;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,698;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,853;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,1279;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,1960;GENERAL_HEALTH,1629;ARREST,125;SOC_GENERALCRIME,125;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,125;MEDIA_SOCIAL,888;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,257;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1430;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,544;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1425;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,544;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1425;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1088;TRIAL,17;TRIAL,669;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1193;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1193;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1193;SECURITY_SERVICES,134;SECURITY_SERVICES,205;SECURITY_SERVICES,251;SECURITY_SERVICES,714;SECURITY_SERVICES,869;SECURITY_SERVICES,1332;SECURITY_SERVICES,1704;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,134;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,205;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,251;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,714;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,869;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1332;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1704;TAX_FNCACT_PORTER,269;TAX_FNCACT_PORTER,1402;TAX_FNCACT_PORTER,1526;LEGISLATION,1181;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1181;",Ohio;Kansas;Dayton,533
448,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business/tesla-autopilot-california-dmv/,"Tesla’s autopilot and self-driving claims are under fire again, this time from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in a complaint it filed on July 28.  The complaint alleges that the company made “untrue or misleading” statements in advertisements on its website by claiming that Tesla vehicles were, or could be, equipped with advanced driver assistance system features.   The Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) advertisements ran in marketing materials on the company’s website “on at least five dates” between May 2021 and July 2022, the complaint said.  They included descriptions such as “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving Capability” and used such wording as “All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go…Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigating urban streets, complex intersections and freeways,” the suit said.   Another claim that the California DMV alleged was misleading said, “The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” “These advertisements are a deceptive practice” under California’s Civil Code, the DMV complaint said.   Tesla does not typically respond to requests for comment. Tesla has published disclaimers from as recently as June warning the features still require active driver supervision, which contradict the “misleading labels and claims,” the complaint added.  Tesla’s advertising actions could cause it to temporarily lose its manufacturer license and special plates number in California, the complaint warned.  Data released in June by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found there were 273 crashes in the last nine months involving Tesla driver-assist technologies, caused by either its “full self-driving” software or its precursor, Tesla Autopilot.  Of  497 total crashes studied by the NHTSA, 43% of those caused by driver-assist technologies took place in California, the data found.  Tesla’s Autopilot feature comes standard in all of its vehicles, making it one of the industry’s most commonly used autopilot systems. While Tesla reminds drivers to stay alert while using it, a 2021 MIT study revealed that users who used the system were more distracted and looked away from the road more often than when they were driving without the feature.  Tesla has 15 days to respond to the complaint in order to avoid a default decision. The department said this complaint is separate from an ongoing review of the intended design and technological capabilities of Tesla vehicles. The Los Angeles Times was first news outlet to report the complaint.  CNN’s Matt McFarland contributed to this report.

426,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/europe/russian-hypersonic-missile-scientist-arrest-treason-hnk-intl/,"A leading Russian scientist in hypersonic flight was arrested on suspicion of treason on Friday, according to Russian state media. Dr Alexander Shiplyuk, director of the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Siberian Branch, is the third Russian scientist this summer to be arrested on suspicion of treason. The institute’s scientific director Vasily Fomin told the Russian news agency TASS that Shiplyuk was sent to the Lefortovo pre-trial detention center in Moscow. His detention comes after the arrest on June 27 of the chief researcher of the institute, Anatoly Maslov, who is suspected of transferring state secret data related to hypersonic missiles.  According to the institute’s website, Shiplyuk heads a technology lab with unique wind tunnels purpose-built for simulating hypersonic conditions. On June 30, the Sovetsky District Court of Novosibirsk arrested another scientist, Dmitry Kolker, a researcher at the Institute of Laser Physics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Kolker was detained on state treason charges for allegedly collaborating with China’s security services, Reuters reported. Kolker, who was diagnosed with stage four cancer, died while being transferred from the pre-trial detention center. Military powers in Russia, China, and the United States are working to develop hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) weapons.

5,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/biden-still-covid-positive/,"President Joe Biden is still testing positive for Covid-19 and “continues to feel well” as he experiences a rebound case of the virus, according to his physician.  Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo on Monday that the President tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test earlier in the morning, “as could be anticipated,” and continues to follow “strict isolation measures” at the White House.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that Biden is not experiencing any “recurring symptoms” and will follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and isolate for five days. Monday marked day two of that latest isolation. “He’s feeling fine,” Jean-Pierre told reporters at a White House briefing.  Jean-Pierre said, “As you know, some of you have had Covid … those symptoms that you have don’t go away right away, they kind of linger, those minimal symptoms kind of linger for some time. So you can expect that.” The President is once again isolating at the White House after emerging from isolation from his first case of Covid-19 in the middle of last week. He has not left the White House in 12 days.  O’Connor said on Saturday that the President had experienced “no reemergence of symptoms, and continues to feel quite well.” In memos on Sunday and Monday, O’Connor said the President “continues to feel well,” but made no explicit mention of symptoms.  Due to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death. The President, who is fully vaccinated and double boosted, first tested positive on July 21 and had mild symptoms for several days before ending his isolation on Wednesday following two negative Covid-19 tests. He completed a five-day course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people age 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription. But after giving a speech from the Rose Garden on Wednesday in which the President said he was “feeling great” and back to working in person, he tested positive on Saturday.  The CDC recently issued guidance saying people who test positive again and whose symptoms come back after finishing their antiviral pills should restart their isolation period and isolate for five full days. The agency says people can end their isolation period after those five additional days as long as their fever has been gone for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication and they’re feeling better. The agency also recommends that people wear a mask for 10 days after their symptoms come back.",Kevin Oconnor;Joe Biden,White House;White House;White House;White House;White House;Us Centers For Disease;Us Centers For Disease;Drug Administration;Cnn,"MEDIA_MSM,725;TAX_FNCACT_PHYSICIAN,163;GENERAL_HEALTH,594;GENERAL_HEALTH,1581;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,594;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1581;WB_1406_DISEASES,594;WB_1406_DISEASES,1581;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,594;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1581;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,594;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1581;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1962;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,2048;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1962;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,2048;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1962;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,2048;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1962;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2048;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1962;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2048;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1962;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,2048;TAX_DISEASE_FEVER,2693;LEADER,14;LEADER,228;LEADER,1014;LEADER,1261;LEADER,1394;LEADER,1730;LEADER,2289;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,14;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,228;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1014;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1261;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1394;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1730;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2289;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,14;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,228;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1014;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1261;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1394;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1730;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2289;TAX_FNCACT_PRESS_SECRETARY,455;MEDICAL,2192;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTOR,2192;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2006;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,615;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1602;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,615;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1602;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,615;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1602;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,615;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1602;WB_2026_PREVENTION,615;WB_2026_PREVENTION,1602;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2024;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,2024;WB_2372_AUTHENTICATION_AND_AUTHORIZATION,2024;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2024;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,394;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,424;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,742;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1057;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1194;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,63;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,257;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1134;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1543;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1909;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,2106;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,60;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,254;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,829;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,1131;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,1540;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,1906;TAX_DISEASE_COVID,2103;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,455;",White House,583
45,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/media/viktor-orbn-cpac-dallas/,"The link from the “you-will-not-replace-us” chant of the people carrying Tiki torches in Charlottesville five summers ago to the replacement-theory-rhetoric of Hungary’s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is direct. And some democracy experts say that the march to the far right at this dangerous moment for American democracy makes it imperative that the media brings its A-game to their coverage of the Hungarian leader’s appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this week in Dallas. Since he came into power, Orbán’s government has “made access to asylum close to impossible, interfered with independent media and academia, launched an assault on members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, and undermined women’s rights,” according to a 2021 Human Rights Watch World report. He even has his own 12-step playbook for gaining and holding power, which he laid out at the CPAC gathering in May. But Jennifer Dresden, policy advocate for Protect Democracy, has a playbook of her own. She is the lead author on the report “The Authoritarian Playbook: How reporters can contextualize and cover authoritarian threats as distinct from politics-as-usual,” and she calls for coverage of Orbán to be “handled with care and context” by the media. “This attempt to hold Orbán’s Hungary up as a model has been growing for over a year now, and that is concerning,” Dresden said. “The academic and think tank research has been really clear: Hungary has been on this incremental path (toward authoritarianism) for over a decade at this point, and Orbán has followed the playbook very, very closely in ways that everybody should be worried about.” Her group’s playbook lays out seven fundamental tactics used by “aspiring authoritarians” and offers guides as to how reporters and editors can recognize and report on them. The steps used to gain authoritarian control range from trying to control the media to stoking violence and corrupting elections, according to the report. Coverage of Orbán at CPAC should include “the fact that the vast majority of media in Hungary are controlled by the government or allies of the government,” Dresden said. It should also include “the electoral system changes that were put in place, which have given an outsize advantage to the ruling party at the expense of opposition parties in terms of how districts are drawn and elections are run,” she added.    Another piece of essential context is the timing of Orbán’s arrival at CPAC. Last summer in writing about Tucker Carlson hosting several of his prime-time Fox News shows from Hungary, I said, “This celebration of Orbán, who controls the press and the courts in Hungary, might not be so alarming if American democracy was not at such a precarious point after Trump’s efforts to undermine the rule of law, government institutions and such democratic norms as the peaceful transfer of power.” One year later, the state of our democracy has been further weakened by restrictive voting laws, Supreme Court rulings and continued amplification of lies by Donald Trump and his allies about the 2020 election. A growing number of citizens and analysts question whether our democracy can survive the assault it is under. What does it say about the state of the American conversation of democracy today that a major conservative organization like CPAC is showcasing a leader who last month warned against “race mixing” in such racist language that it led to a 20-year adviser of his resigning as she labeled his words a “pure Nazi text”? And he will be appearing on the same CPAC stage as former President  Trump and more than 20 members of Congress.  “You don’t want to give this guy airtime, but it’s a story you have to cover,” said Robert C. Lieberman, professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. “The fact that American conservatives seem to admire him and think of him as someone to emulate really reveals the true colors of that wing of the Republican Party and American conservative movement,” the co-author of “Four Threats: The Recurring Crises of American Democracy” added.  “It’s one thing when Tucker Carlson says nice things about him on television or does his show from Budapest (last summer). It’s even another thing when CPAC has a meeting in Budapest (in May),” Lieberman said. “But I think having Orbán standing up in the United States as a mouthpiece for this movement is taking that to another level of potential harm.” Dresden says it’s a story “that shouldn’t be ignored, but it is also a situation where amplifying Orbán and his role in this in some ways can also have negative effects.”  She cautions against sensationalism: “And that extends beyond reporters. We know from other research in other areas that headlines matter a lot and imagery matters a lot …  So, just being thoughtful and taking a second to think about coverage is the first thing I would say.” There has been a considerable amount of thoughtful pre-speech coverage.  In a strong piece published on August 2 in The Dispatch, Dalibor Rohac asked if “U.S. conservatives know what they are signing up for in embracing Hungary’s strongman?” The Washington Post’s editorial board made a powerful case in a July 30 piece, saying Orbán’s racist comments should have been cause for CPAC to disinvite him. And CNN’s Fareed Zakaria provided necessary context as he explained on July 31 how Orbán’s warning about “mixed races” ignored the facts of the country’s history. Lieberman is hoping those who read and see such coverage will think about the seriousness and possible danger of Orbán’s visit to CPAC. “We used to think of CPAC as a circus,” he said. “Here are these people who get together and wear their silly outfits and talk among themselves. And they’re kind of harmless. But that’s not the case anymore.”",Donald Trump;Fareed Zakaria;Dalibor Rohac;Tucker Carlson;Tucker Carlson;Viktor Orban;Viktor Orban,Supreme Court;Johns Hopkins University;Republican Party;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States;United States,"UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,879;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,3428;MEDIA_MSM,364;MEDIA_MSM,1488;MEDIA_MSM,2128;LEADER,190;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,190;TAX_FNCACT_EDITORS,2012;EXTREMISM,281;ELECTION,2171;ELECTION,2607;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,3849;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,3362;AFFECT,790;REFUGEES,790;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,790;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,319;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2949;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3492;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4038;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4187;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4272;TAX_AIDGROUPS_HUMAN_RIGHTS_WATCH,1019;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,4176;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,1261;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,424;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,543;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,636;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,3596;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3816;UNGP_GENDER_EQUALITY,981;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2522;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4176;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,2794;MEDIA_CENSORSHIP,846;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,3373;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,764;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2344;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2371;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3056;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,764;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2344;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2371;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3056;EDUCATION,3963;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,3963;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,465;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,3976;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1006;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,364;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,846;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1488;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2128;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2300;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,364;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,846;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1488;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2128;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2300;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,364;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,846;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1488;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2128;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2300;RESIGNATION,3706;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,613;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,706;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,175;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,1293;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,1358;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,2081;USPEC_POLICY1,1178;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1178;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4518;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,190;TAX_ETHNICITY_HUNGARIAN,417;TAX_ETHNICITY_HUNGARIAN,536;TAX_ETHNICITY_HUNGARIAN,629;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_HUNGARIAN,417;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_HUNGARIAN,536;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_HUNGARIAN,629;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,974;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,4209;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,4604;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,3689;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4170;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,4012;DISCRIMINATION,3653;DISCRIMINATION,5443;DISCRIMINATION_RACE_RACIST,3653;DISCRIMINATION_RACE_RACIST,5443;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1013;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1013;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1013;DEMOCRACY,237;DEMOCRACY,329;DEMOCRACY,1209;DEMOCRACY,2959;DEMOCRACY,3171;DEMOCRACY,3404;DEMOCRACY,3518;DEMOCRACY,4282;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,237;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,329;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,1209;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,2959;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,3171;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,3404;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,3518;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,4282;LGBT,905;SCIENCE,3984;SLFID_RULE_OF_LAW,3043;LEGISLATION,3043;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3043;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2148;CORRUPTION,2161;",Budapest;United States;Hungarian;Dallas;Washington;American;Hungary,1199
395,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/biden-covid-fraud-bills/,"President Joe Biden signed into law two bipartisan bills on Friday aimed at holding accountable individuals who commit fraud under pandemic relief programs.  The two new laws will extend the time period prosecutors have to prosecute individuals who committed fraud through the Paycheck Protection Program or Covid-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, extending the statute of limitations for criminal and civil enforcement against a borrower to 10 years.  During a signing event held on the balcony of the White House on Friday, Biden underscored that it was “essential to extend the statute of limitations for certain pandemic fraud … to 10 years to make sure fraudsters can’t run out the clock.” “My message to those cheats out there is this: You can’t hide. We’re going to find you. We’re going to make you pay back what you stole and hold you accountable under the law,” the President said.  In his remarks, Biden squarely blamed his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, for failing to promote safeguards against defrauding Covid-19 economic relief programs.  “Not only did the Trump administration let the biggest businesses with the teams of lawyers and accountants to the front of the line, my predecessor undermined the watchdogs who were supposed to be on the job to make sure relief went to the mom and pop businesses that were supposed to get in the first place,” said Biden, who was delivering remarks outdoors due to a rebound positive case of Covid-19. “In my State of the Union address, I made it clear: The watchdogs are back.”  “American people deserve to know whether their tax dollars are being spent as intended,” he said.  Along with calling on Congress to pass extensions of the statutes of limitation, the White House has pointed out that the President has also called for additional penalties for those who commit fraud on Covid-19 benefits and signed an executive order focused on identity theft in pandemic relief programs.   In the years since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, federal prosecutors have continued to identify fraud related to pandemic relief funds.  The US Secret Service has seized more than a billion dollars in relief funds obtained by fraudsters and, in December, tapped a senior official to work with law enforcement agencies across the country on the issue. In April, federal prosecutors charged 21 people for allegedly seeking to defraud government health care programs of $149 million through a variety of pandemic-related scams, including selling fake Covid-19 vaccination cards and submitting claims for unnecessary medical tests.

521,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/asia/china-taiwan-military-exercises-what-we-learned-intl-hnk-ml/,"China’s military exercises show Beijing doesn’t need to invade Taiwan to control it – rather it can strangle the self-ruled island, cutting it off from the outside world, Chinese and American analysts say. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) drills, which officially began last Thursday, focused on six zones that essentially encircled Taiwan, restricting access to civilian ships and aircraft in the area, as forces conducted live-fire drills and missile launches. Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the PLA National Defense University, said the six areas were chosen to show how China could cut off Taiwan’s ports, attack its most important military installations, and sever access for foreign forces that may come to Taiwan’s aid. “Connect the six areas in a line, like a noose, with the knot of the noose right in the southwest direction,” Meng said in an interview with state-run broadcaster CCTV.  China’s Communist Party views democratic Taiwan as its territory – despite never having controlled it. Uniting Taiwan with the mainland is a cornerstone of Chinese policy and President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under Beijing’s control. Meng noted the northern exercise areas had successfully sealed off Taiwan from Okinawa, the island where both Japan and the United States base substantial military assets. In the southern areas, the PLA showed it could control the Bashi Channel, “the only way to enter and exit the South China Sea,” he said. And in the eastern areas, China’s forces showed that accurate Chinese missile fire could force foreign warships to back away from Taiwan’s waters, he added. “This is an unprecedented encirclement of Taiwan Island,” Meng said. And on Monday, China issued a notice to say drills were continuing.  A trigger for long-planned exercises The exercises kicked off after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi angered Beijing by visiting Taipei last week to show her support for democracy on the island.  Beijing flooded the seas and skies around Taiwan with ships and jets – as many as 80 Chinese warplanes and vessels were detected in the Taiwan Strait Sunday, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.  On previous days, the PLA also fired rockets toward small, Taiwan-controlled islands near the mainland, and launched ballistic missiles farther afield, with some flying over Taiwan and falling in the ocean east of the island. Five splashed down in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone – a message to one of Taiwan’s key supporters as well as the government in Taipei. A map of the six Chinese exercise areas “clearly plots out where the Chinese think the key operating areas are for their strategic intimidation of Taiwan,” Mick Ryan, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former Australian Army general, wrote on Twitter. Commercial ships and aircraft were warned to stay clear of the exercise zones, forcing shippers and airlines to arrange alternative routes. Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii said the blockade of six zones showed that any takeover of Taiwan could begin with an isolation strategy.  “The exercise demonstrated that blockade in a conflict need not require a constant naval presence offshore, but rather, shipping and air traffic can be deterred by air and missile threats in support of a maritime blockade,” Schuster said. “The exercise … suggests Beijing would first isolate Taiwan and resort to air and missile strikes in hopes of breaking Taipei’s political will. A costly invasion probably is a last resort,” Schuster said.  What could come next Schuster said much of what Beijing demonstrated had long been in the works. The drills coincided with standard military exercises on the PLA’s training calendar, but he said Pelosi’s visit allowed China to make a bigger statement. “The size, geographic expanse and complexity of the exercise reflected months of planning,” he said. “This exercise marks the latest escalation in China’s expanding military exercise and Taiwan-intimidation campaign.” He said he expects the PLA will continue to put pressure on Taiwan, and could also send a message to Japan with more drills to the north of the island. New exercises are also likely in the South China Sea, the 1.3 million square miles of water, almost all of which China claims as its sovereign territory, where Beijing has built up military fortifications on contested islands, Schuster said. While continuing exercises will allow the PLA to refine its tactics and operations, they also can provide an opportunity for adversaries to learn about the modern Chinese military, experts say. “Nothing provides better insights into the actual capability of a military than seeing them deployed,” Ryan, the former Australian Army general, wrote on Twitter.  With last week’s drills, Xi had to demonstrate he would not waver on his commitment to bringing Taiwan under Beijing’s control, Schuster said. Pelosi’s visit to the island posed a direct threat to that by presenting an alternative vision of democracy. “(Pelosi) leads the democratically elected branch that originates America’s government funding and economic policies. Her position and role makes her commitment to Taiwan’s security particularly significant,” Schuster said. “Unable to bully her, Xi had to demonstrate China’s power – diplomatic, economic and military,” he said. While the military exercises gave Xi strong visuals to support his resolve, China also hit Pelosi and the US government with a range of sanctions. The measures include the cancellation of future phone calls and meetings between Chinese and US military leaders and the suspension of cooperation on matters including the repatriation of illegal immigrants, legal assistance on criminal matters and the combat of transnational crimes. Talks on climate change were also suspended. Beijing also announced measures targeting Pelosi and members of her immediate family. “The goal is intimidation via the application of all elements of Chinese power,” Schuster said.",Mick Ryan;Carl Schuster;Nancy Pelosi;Meng Xiangqing,China Communist Party;Australian Army;Australian Army;Twitter;Twitter;United States;People Liberation Army;Taiwan Defense Ministry;National Defense University;Us Pacific Command Joint Intelligence Center,"IMMIGRATION,6707;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,6707;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,6615;MARITIME,2160;MARITIME_PIRACY,3537;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,6013;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,2940;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,5550;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,229;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3383;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3383;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,2555;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODED,2069;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2069;MILITARY,272;MILITARY,2945;MILITARY,5555;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,652;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,952;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2515;WB_862_GROWTH_POLES_AND_ECONOMIC_ZONES,2515;WB_346_COMPETITIVE_INDUSTRIES,2515;BULLYING,6272;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,1922;WB_135_TRANSPORT,643;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,643;WB_167_PORTS,643;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,6828;LEADER,1109;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1109;DEMOCRACY,969;TAX_FNCACT_MILITARY_LEADERS,6615;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,952;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_PEOPLE_LIBERATION_ARMY,272;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,238;TRAFFIC,3471;BLOCKADE,3242;BLOCKADE,3369;BLOCKADE,3546;SEIGE,3242;SEIGE,3369;SEIGE,3546;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2581;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,5924;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6477;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2581;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,5924;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6477;GOV_REPATRIATION,6685;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3148;EDUCATION,528;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,528;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,3713;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MENG,504;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MENG,875;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MENG,1224;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MENG,1759;EPU_ECONOMY,2510;EPU_ECONOMY,5943;EPU_ECONOMY,6334;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2510;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,5943;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,6334;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,946;SANCTIONS,6503;WB_137_WATER,1683;USPEC_POLICY1,1097;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1097;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,6808;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,6808;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,6808;ARMEDCONFLICT,2150;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,6738;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,567;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,283;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,477;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1817;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4169;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4932;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,5607;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,2029;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,5839;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,671;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2972;MEDIA_SOCIAL,5582;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_LIBERATION_ARMY,272;TAX_WEAPONS_WARSHIPS,1651;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,5782;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,218;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1090;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1609;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2140;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2610;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2708;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2759;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5393;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6593;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6996;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,218;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1090;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1609;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2140;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2610;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2708;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2759;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5393;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6593;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6996;",Japan;Hawaii;Taiwan;Seoul;Australian;Bashi Channel;United States;America;Chinese;South China Sea;South Korea;Beijing;Taipei;American;China,1158
171,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/business-food/cracker-barrel-impossible-meat-controversy/,"Some of the meat at Cracker Barrel might be fake, but the beef that it’s causing is very real. On Monday, the chain posted on Facebook about a plant-based sausage made by Impossible Foods that’ Cracker Barrel had added to breakfast menus earlier this summer. The post sparked strong reactions from its followers, with many complaining that Cracker Barrel should not be offering the meat alternative. “I just lost respect for a once great Tennessee company,” one person commented. Another comment said: “Not going to happen! Cracker Barrel used to be so good, we looked forward to eating in them but not anymore,” while another person wrote “bad choice.” Others expressed skepticism that the product would taste good. Several commenters decried the “woke” addition to the menu. Not all of the reaction was negative, however, with many people thanking the chain for the option. “I couldn’t even tell the difference. I think it’s great for people who can’t eat meat for whatever reason,” one person wrote. In a statement to CNN Business, Cracker Barrel said it’s “always exploring opportunities to expand how our guests experience breakfast and provide choices to satisfy every taste bud – whether people want to stick with traditional favorites like bacon and sausage or are hungry for a new, nutritious plant-based option like Impossible Sausage.” On Thursday, Cracker Barrel responded to the controversy on Instagram, posting a picture with the plant-based sausage and pork sausage together. “Where pork-based and plant-based sausage lovers can breakfast all day in harmony,” the caption reads. Roadside rival McDonald’s\n            \n                (MCD) has eliminated all-day breakfasts.  Cracker Barrel added Impossible Sausage to menus as part of a broader shakeup of its offerings. The chain said that this was its “first plant-based protein at a time when more than ever, consumers are seeking plant-based options that are better for them.” Eaters are gravitating toward alternative meats, with major chains, like Dunkin’ and Burger King, adding them to its menus.

48,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/entertainment/marilyn-monroe-ana-de-armas-blonde-cec/,"The Marilyn Monroe Estate is coming to the defense of Ana de Armas, following critiques of her accent in her portrayal of Monroe in an upcoming Netflix film.  Armas stars as the iconic bombshell in Netflix’s upcoming “Blonde,” a drama about the life of Monroe. But Armas, who was born in Cuba, doesn’t nail Monroe’s original breathy tone, some critics have accused. The estate, however, has a different opinion. “Marilyn Monroe is a singular Hollywood and pop culture icon that transcends generations and history,” said Marc Rosen, president of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group (ABG), which owns the Marilyn Monroe Estate, in a statement to CNN. “Any actor that steps into that role knows they have big shoes to fill. Based on the trailer alone, it looks like Ana was a great casting choice as she captures Marilyn’s glamour, humanity and vulnerability. We can’t wait to see the film in its entirety!”  Armas has not publicly commented on the criticisms, but in an interview with The Times of London, she said she took nine months of dialect coaching to get Monroe’s accent right.  “Blonde,” based on the novel by Joyce Carol Oates, is a fictionalized retelling of Monroe’s life and chronicles her rise. The film is set to premiere on Netflix on September 28.

668,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/biden-kentucky-trip-flooding/,"President Joe Biden visited eastern Kentucky on Monday and pledged the full support of the federal government as the commonwealth begins rebuilding following flooding that killed more than three dozen people and caused catastrophic damage.  The President was joined by Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and received a briefing on the ongoing response efforts to the flooding.  “It’s going to take a while to get through this but I promise you we’re not leaving. The federal government and all its resources – we’re not leaving,” Biden said during the briefing, which took place at an elementary school in Lost Creek. “As long as it takes, we’re going to be here.”  First lady Jill Biden also traveled to Kentucky with the President. Along with Beshear, Biden was also accompanied by several Kentucky elected officials during his trip, including Kentucky Republican Rep. Hal Rogers. Biden said that he had invited Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to Kentucky, but McConnell did not come. When asked by CNN if he wished the Kentucky senator had joined him, Biden responded: “No, I don’t think so. I don’t think he has to. He’s got a Senate to run.”   Thousands remain displaced after the flooding swept away entire homes. Many also remain stranded without access to clean water, electricity and critical supplies, as some communities remain impossible to access because of heavily damaged infrastructure. High temperatures, thunderstorms and humidity have been posing challenges to response efforts.  After surveying damage and meeting with families affected by the flooding, the President praised the local community for their “courage” and “stamina.”  “We’re the only country in the world that has come out of every major disaster stronger than we went into it. We got clobbered going in but we came out stronger. That’s the objective here,” Biden said.  He continued, telling the group as they were surrounded by devastation from the floods, “So I don’t want any Kentuckian telling me, ‘You don’t have to do this for me.’ Oh, yeah we do. You’re an American citizen. We never give up, we never stop, we never bow, we never bend – we just go forward. And that’s what we’re going to do here.”  Biden on Sunday made additional disaster assistance available to Kentucky after initially approving a disaster declaration on July 29 to supplement local recovery efforts with federal funding.  Monday’s trip took place shortly after Biden was officially cleared to emerge from isolation after recovering from a rebound case of Covid-19. The President had spent 18 days at the White House because of two back-to-back cases of Covid-19, but then traveled to Rehoboth, Delaware, on Sunday. He tested negative on Saturday but remained in isolation until testing negative again on Sunday.  Up until Sunday, Biden had not left the White House since initially testing positive for Covid-19 on July 21. After taking a five-day course of Pfizer’s antiviral drug, Paxlovid, he tested positive for a rebound case of Covid-19 on July 30 and resumed isolation.  The trip came the day after the Senate passed a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill, in a significant victory for Biden and his party. The massive bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect. The legislation still needs to pass the House of Representatives.  CNN’s Maegan Vazquez and Sam Fossum contributed to this report.

632,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/white-house-summon-chinese-ambassador-qin-gang-provocations/,"The White House summoned China’s ambassador on Thursday to condemn China’s “irresponsible” military activities near Taiwan as tensions continue to escalate in the region following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island this week. “After China’s actions overnight, we summoned PRC Ambassador Qin Gang to the White House to demarche him about the PRC’s provocative actions. We condemned the PRC’s military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said in a statement to CNN.  The decision to summon Qin came after days of warnings to China not to escalate tensions in the region following the speaker’s visit to the self-governing island, which the Chinese Communist Party regards as its territory despite having never controlled it. It represents a shift from the White House’s attitude about the trip before it occurred, when officials privately tried to warn Pelosi over the possible consequences of the visit and how it could harm US-China relations. The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post.  In the days since Pelosi left Taiwan, China has taken multiple bellicose steps, both diplomatically and militarily.  On the diplomatic front, Beijing is sanctioning Pelosi and her immediate family and said Friday it would suspend cooperation with Washington on several issues, including combating the climate crisis.  The pause in climate talks between the US and China is symbolically significant for the two nations’ bilateral relationship because the climate crisis was one of the few areas the US and China had continued to cooperate on in recent years, even during times of heightened geopolitical tensions. The US and China announced in Glasgow last year a bilateral agreement to cooperate on the climate crisis, widely seen as a progressive step that would allow China to work on key issues – like reducing methane emissions – without having to join global agreements that it had shown resistance to. The nations’ climate representatives had been in regular communication to build on that agreement.  Taiwan’s defense ministry said Chinese warships and aircraft conducted drills in waters around the island and that Chinese forces crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China – in a move the ministry called a “highly provocative act.” Two Chinese drones also flew close to Japan on Thursday, prompting the country’s Air Self-Defense Force to scramble fighter jets in response, according to a statement from Tokyo’s Ministry of Defense.  Kirby said the White House told Qin the US does not want a crisis in the region and reiterated there has been no change to the US’ “One China” policy and that Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China.  “We also made clear that the United States is prepared for what Beijing chooses to do. We will not seek and do not want a crisis. At the same time, we will not be deterred from operating in the seas and skies of the Western Pacific, consistent with international law, as we have for decades – supporting Taiwan and defending a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Kirby said in the statement.  NSC Coordinator for Indo Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell met with Qin, according to a source familiar with the matter. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Friday that the US has repeatedly conveyed to China that “we do not seek and will not provoke a crisis.” He called China’s recent actions “provocative” and “a significant escalation.”  The speaker’s visit, he said, was “peaceful” and “there is no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response.” Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the visit – the first time a US House speaker had visited Taiwan in 25 years – was intended to make it “unequivocally clear” that the United States would “not abandon” Taipei. It came at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a visit to the democratically governed island. The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, and is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. But it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” The US postponed a long planned missile test because of China’s angry reaction to Pelosi’s trip. A US official told CNN that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin directed the Department of Defense to postpone the test flight of an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile after China launched military exercises.  A top official at the Chinese embassy in Washington said Friday that Qin “totally rejected the so-called condemnation” by the White House of China’s cross-strait military actions when he was summoned. “The only way out of this crisis is that the US side must take matters immediately to rectify its mistakes and eliminate the grave impact of Pelosi’s visit,” Minister Jing Quan said during a virtual briefing.  Jing reiterated that China views Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan as “a serious violation of the One China policy.” He said that they view the trip by the lawmaker as an official US government visit, noting that Pelosi flew on a US government plane. Using a government plane is standard for congressional delegations, especially for the House speaker who is high in the line of presidential succession. He argued Pelosi “knows where China’s red lines are” but said she “still chose to deliberately provoke and challenge China’s position.” Kirby on Friday responded to Qin, saying, “There’s nothing here for the United States to rectify – the Chinese can go a long way to taking the tensions down simply by stopping these provocative military exercises and ending the rhetoric.” “We don’t want a crisis.

Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania were fined thousands of dollars each by the sergeant at arms after they skipped security screenings outside the House chamber that were put in place following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The trio then sued in DC District Court to challenge the House rules. But Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, on Monday dismissed the case, saying he did not have jurisdiction. The House sergeant at arms and the House’s top administrator were protected from the court wading into the House rules because of the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause, the judge determined.  “Here, each challenged act of the House Officers qualifies as a legislative act,” Kelly wrote. “Thus, the Speech or Debate Clause bars the Members’ claims.”",Louie Gohmert;Timothy Kelly;Andrew Clyde;Lloyd Smucker,Dc District Court,"TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,56;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,56;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,270;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,610;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,270;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT_AT_ARMS,610;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,640;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,380;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,824;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,824;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT,262;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SERGEANT,602;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT,262;TAX_FNCACT_SERGEANT,602;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,20;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,479;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,761;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,88;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,298;TRIAL,418;CONSTITUTIONAL,726;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,138;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,138;TAX_FNCACT_APPOINTEE,513;",Georgia;Pennsylvania;Texas,192

409,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/monkeypox-black-hispanic-reaj/,"A detailed analysis of monkeypox case records published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday offers new insight into the outbreak, which is disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men, especially those who are Black and Hispanic. There were 2,891 cases of monkeypox reported in the United States by July 22, about two months after the country’s first case was reported. Case report forms with additional epidemiologic and clinical information were submitted to the CDC for 41% of those cases, though not all details were complete in all of those forms. Among the cases with available data, 94% were in men who reported recent sexual or close intimate contact with another man. More than half (54%) of cases were among Black and Hispanic people, a group that represents about a third (34%) of the general US population. And the share of cases among Black people has grown in recent weeks, according to the CDC analysis.  “Public health efforts should prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who are currently disproportionately affected, for prevention and testing, while addressing equity, minimizing stigma, and maintaining vigilance for transmission in other populations,” the authors of the report say. Additional analysis shows that all of the patients had a rash. However, a genital rash was more commonly reported in the current outbreak than in “typical” monkeypox. It was the most common location for rash (46%), followed by arms (40%), face (38%) and legs (37%). More than a third of cases with available data reported rash in four or more regions. Early warning signs of illness, however, are less common in the current outbreak compared with “typical” monkeypox. In about 2 in 5 cases, the illness started with the rash – but no reported prodromal symptoms such as chills, headache or malaise. About 2 in 5 cases also did not report fever. The authors of the report emphasize that anyone with a rash consistent with monkeypox should be tested for the virus, regardless of their sexual or gender identity or the presence of other symptoms.  Among those cases for which data was available, fewer than 1 in 10 (8%) needed hospitalization due to monkeypox. No deaths were reported. Of those for whom vaccination status was available, 14% had gotten a vaccine for smallpox, including 3% who had gotten one dose of Jynneos during this outbreak. At least one person with monkeypox had symptoms more than three weeks after their first dose of the Jynneos vaccine. A “substantial proportion” of monkeypox cases have been reported among people with HIV, who may be at higher risk of severe illness. More analysis of this group is underway, according to the CDC.   The agency says it is “continually evaluating new evidence and tailoring response strategies as information on changing case demographics, clinical characteristics, transmission, and vaccine effectiveness become available.”",,Us Centers For Disease;United States,"KILL,2552;HEALTH_VACCINATION,1000;HEALTH_VACCINATION,1088;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,1000;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,1088;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,1000;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,1088;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1000;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1088;TAX_DISEASE_HIV,2912;TAX_DISEASE_CHILLS,1997;TAX_DISEASE_PRODROMAL_SYMPTOMS,1982;GENERAL_HEALTH,90;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,90;WB_1406_DISEASES,90;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,90;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,90;TAX_DISEASE_SMALLPOX,2659;WB_615_GENDER,2222;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,111;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1270;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,111;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1270;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,111;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1270;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,111;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1270;WB_2026_PREVENTION,111;WB_2026_PREVENTION,1270;MEDICAL,1128;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,158;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1564;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1858;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,2727;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,158;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1564;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1858;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2727;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,158;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1564;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1858;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2727;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,158;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1564;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1858;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2727;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,158;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1564;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1858;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2727;TAX_DISEASE_RASH,1487;TAX_DISEASE_RASH,1513;TAX_DISEASE_RASH,1632;TAX_DISEASE_RASH,1740;TAX_DISEASE_RASH,1949;TAX_DISEASE_RASH,2127;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,37;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,309;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,991;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1079;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1590;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1890;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2153;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2285;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2366;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2541;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2761;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2865;TAX_DISEASE_FEVER,2064;AFFECT,198;LGBT,940;LGBT,1028;LGBT,1158;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,699;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1476;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,257;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,744;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,868;",United States,608
316,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/kentucky-abortion-ban/,"A Kentucky state court of appeals has reinstated the state’s so-called “trigger law” banning abortion as well as a separate law banning the procedure after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, siding with Attorney General Daniel Cameron and allowing the laws to temporarily be enforced while the case proceeds in the courts. “I appreciate the court’s decision to allow Kentucky’s pro-life laws to take effect while we continue to vigorously defend the constitutionality of these important protections for women and unborn children across the Commonwealth,” Cameron, a Republican, said on Twitter.  Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said in a statement that it was a “devastating day for all Kentuckians.”  “Abortion is essential health care, and it is irresponsible and dangerous to prevent people from accessing the care they need,” Gibron said.  Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court for emergency relief, arguing in a news release that the decision from the state court of appeals “eviscerates reproductive freedom in Kentucky.” “While yesterday’s ruling is a setback, this fight is far from over. We’ll continue doing everything in our power to restore abortion access in Kentucky as soon as possible,” the groups said in a joint statement.  The order came in a case brought by Planned Parenthood and other providers challenging the laws. Previously, the appeals court, as well as the state Supreme Court, declined to reverse a temporary restraining order issued against the two laws by the Jefferson Circuit Court. But on July 22, the circuit court issued a temporary injunction that the appeals court put on hold on Monday. After the July 22 move, “this matter is now properly before the Court for consideration of the request for emergency relief,” the appeals court said Monday.

283,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/impeachment-10-washington-primaries/,"Two of Tuesday’s primaries in Washington state represent a key question for the Republican Party: 18 months removed from Donald Trump’s second impeachment, has the GOP anger at party lawmakers who backed the effort subsided? Primary voters will answer that question for Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse, two of the 10 House Republicans who joined Democrats to impeach Trump after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. In the months since their votes, both have paid the price at home. They have been criticized by their state party, censured by local leaders and challenged by handfuls of Republican challengers. But heading into Tuesday, Republicans in Washington state acknowledge that there is considerable uncertainty in both primaries, leading many in the state to believe it is possible – if not likely – that they could survive. “If the vote was held a month (after the impeachment decision), they probably would have lost,” said one Washington Republican operative. “But given 9% inflation, given the high gas prices we saw, if you are talking with conservative voters, they may be more concerned with the current situation in the country than they are 16 or 18 months ago.” Herrera Beutler is facing off against a series of opponents who have attacked her for the impeachment vote, including author Heidi St. John, state Rep. Vicki Kraft and retired special forces officer Joe Kent, whom Trump has backed. Newhouse, likewise, faces a series of Republicans who have hammered him for his vote, including former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler, state Rep. Brad Klippert and vocal election denier Loren Culp, who has been endorsed by Trump. A spokesperson for Herrera Beutler and Newhouse did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment for this story. There is little public polling in either race, leaving many in the dark about what could happen. Adding to the uncertainty in both races is the fact that redistricting has shifted both districts slightly and Washington state’s open nonpartisan primary system that allows people to vote for any candidate, regardless of affiliation. The top two vote-getters in the primary move on to the general election, regardless of party. If either Herrera Beutler or Newhouse moves on to the general election, it is likely they will keep their seat – both districts lean toward Republicans. Herrera Beutler and Newhouse are not the only Republicans who backed impeachment on the ballot this month. In Michigan, voters will decide Tuesday between Rep. Peter Meijer and Trump-backed John Gibbs, a candidate who has made attacking Meijer’s vote central to his campaign. And on August 16, voters in Wyoming will judge whether Rep. Liz Cheney – who voted to impeach the former President, has become a vocal critic of him and has served as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 – deserves another term in Congress as she faces off against Trump-backed Harriet Hageman. For many Republicans, including Trump, Cheney represents their most highly sought-after incumbent to take down, given how vocal she has been in her opposition to Trump. ‘It is a mess’ Herrera Beutler was not shy about her impeachment vote at the time that she cast it, often taking to Twitter to both defend and explain the vote. During a tele-town hall shortly after the vote, when a voter told the congresswoman he was “very disappointed” in her vote, Herrera Beutler vividly described the “pounding” on the doors of the House chamber during the January 6 attack. “I can see how someone would say his speech didn’t do it. But I don’t know a way to explain that he didn’t try and stop it,” she said. And she and outside groups supporting her have spent millions to win her primary. Herrera Beutler’s campaign has spent $1.7 million on ads attacking Kent, the Republican seen as her most viable opponent, while Winning for Women Action Fund has spent another $1.7 million targeting Kent as “not who you think he is,” noting that he used to be a registered Democrat and voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary. Kent has responded with $613,000 worth of ads, including one where he responds to the charges. “Truth is, I’ve never voted Democrat in a general election,” he says. Kent has acknowledged voting for Sanders but said it was an effort to wreak havoc on the Democratic primary process to help Trump. “I was so committed to helping him win that I voted for Bernie Sanders in the Democrat Primary because I believed he would be easier opponent for President Trump to defeat,” he writes on his website. It is also possible that St. John, a conservative author and speaker, could spoil Kent’s chances of advancing. St. John has run just over $100,000 worth of television ads attacking Herrera Beutler, but the outside group Conservatives for a Stronger America has poured nearly $800,000 into the race with ads boosting St. John as “the real deal.” The ads likely cut into Kent’s conservative support, thereby helping Herrera Beutler. Treva Mahar, vice chair of the Skamania County Republican Party, acknowledged the uncertainty in the race to unseat Herrera Beutler, in part because life in southern Washington seemed so removed from the impeachment vote months ago. “Had she not voted to impeach Trump, it might not have generated this much action against her,” said Mahar, whose organization censured Herrera Beutler and endorsed Kent. “There were a lot of Republicans who felt like she was not really representing us well anyway, but she was the best option at that point. Now we have some better options.” She added: “If Jamie Herrera Beutler wins this election, than the Republican Party needs to work harder and harder and harder… to oppose Republicans like her.” There has been considerably less ad spending against Newhouse, who has spent just under $500,000 on ads for his own campaign and has received a considerable boost from Defending Main Street super PAC, a group that has aired over $800,000 in ads backing the Republican incumbent and highlighting his ties to agriculture, the major industry in the district. Debra Manjarrez, chair of the Yakima County Republicans, said there would “absolutely not” have been a competitive primary if Newhouse had voted against impeachment and that the Republican congressman since 2015 would have “won with 60% of the vote” in November. But Manjarrez, like others, worry that the fractured field is going to help Newhouse move on. While some Republicans have rallied around Trump and backed Culp, there are a number of candidates running as Trump-style conservatives. “It is a mess,” she said. Teagan Levine, chair of the Okanogan County Republican Party, said “emotions were hot” shortly after the impeachment vote and she had many people coming to her and saying, “We are done with Dan, we are done with Dan, find someone better.” The county party went on to censure Newhouse for the impeachment vote but has not endorsed a candidate in the primary. As primary day has drawn closer, however, some of those same people who were ready to oust Newhouse aren’t as fired up by impeachment as they once were. “Just this last week, I have had several people mention that Culp doesn’t have any agricultural experience, so how would he be able to help us with A, B and C,” Levine recalled. “(Emotions) were running high and now that voters need to check a box on a ballot, it’s a little bit harder for them to have a clearer choice because now they are taking into consideration” more than just the impeachment vote.",Donald Trump;Jamie Herrera Beutler;Debra Manjarrez;Brad Klippert;Teagan Levine;Liz Cheney;John Gibbs;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Herrera Beutler;Dan Newhouse;Harriet Hageman;Vicki Kraft;Peter Meijer;Jaime Herrera Beutler;Jerrod Sessler;Treva Mahar;Joe Kent;Loren Culp;Bernie Sanders;Bernie Sanders,Republican Party;Republican Party;Republican Party;Republican Party;Twitter;Winning For Women Action Fund;Cnn;Cnn;Meijer;Meijer,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,6487;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,6237;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,339;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,648;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1464;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2327;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2386;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2920;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5385;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5671;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,6095;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,6412;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,6019;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,3621;ECON_INFLATION,986;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,986;WB_442_INFLATION,986;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,557;AGRICULTURE,5998;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,3939;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,4145;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,4395;TAX_ECON_PRICE,473;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2845;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,2845;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,97;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,5010;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,5607;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,6630;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,1291;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,4568;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,395;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3455;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_YAKIMA,6076;IMPEACHMENT,146;IMPEACHMENT,883;IMPEACHMENT,1267;IMPEACHMENT,2409;IMPEACHMENT,3137;IMPEACHMENT,5164;IMPEACHMENT,6203;IMPEACHMENT,6685;IMPEACHMENT,6868;IMPEACHMENT,7057;IMPEACHMENT,7461;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2704;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4464;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,6329;USPEC_POLICY1,719;USPEC_POLICY1,1877;USPEC_POLICY1,5041;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,719;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,1877;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,5041;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENT,2998;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENT,5959;MILITARY,1356;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OKANOGAN,6591;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,2054;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,2541;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,6904;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1660;LEADER,185;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,185;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,185;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,2638;VETO,6191;FUELPRICES,1014;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,1014;ECON_HEATINGOIL,1014;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,360;ELECTION,234;ELECTION,1067;ELECTION,2456;ELECTION,2616;ELECTION,7300;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,3807;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,5659;MEDIA_MSM,4673;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSWOMAN,3316;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,5727;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,91;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,596;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,955;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3748;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5004;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5601;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5949;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6225;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6624;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,91;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,596;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,955;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3748;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5004;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5601;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5949;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6225;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6624;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1532;MEDIA_SOCIAL,3197;TAX_FNCACT_CRITIC,2732;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1364;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1364;RATIFY,3951;RATIFY,4364;",Skamania County;Wyoming;Michigan;America;Washington;Vermont;Okanogan County,1580

This line of mostly men is waiting for the monkeypox virus vaccine. The illness is spreading rapidly and on Thursday the Biden administration declared it a public health emergency.  Many however will leave empty-handed as local hospitals and clinics have had to rely on an inconsistent and insufficient supply of vaccines, a dilemma that has infuriated patients and advocates.  San Francisco General opens the clinic doors at 8 a.m. and the line inches forward slowly. The hospital will distribute the available doses until the supply runs out.   For Cody Aarons, 31, it was his third attempt. He stood calmly with more than 100 people already in front of him.    “I was in New York for the past month for work, and I tried with their online portal system and was unsuccessful in getting a vaccine,” said the health care worker who thought he might have a better chance in San Francisco.   But 45 minutes after starting the day’s distribution, a hospital staff member passed by with an announcement. “Folks we have reached our limit for today,” he shouted. “However, we will try to find you more shots.”  Although with no guarantee of getting the monkeypox vaccine that day, Aarons – and just about everyone in line – stayed put.  “People want their vaccine,” said Rafael Mandelman, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. “I know one person who was in that line four different days before he finally got his vaccination.”  Mandelman, who got up at 4:30 a.m. and waited for hours before getting his vaccine shot days earlier, is frustrated with the rollout.  “After having come through a pandemic where we were able to discover a new vaccine, [and] distribute tens of millions of doses within a matter of months, the fact that with an existing known vaccine we cannot get more than these paltry little dribbles out is very frustrating to people,” he said.  In California, the vast majority of those infected – more than 98% – are men, with more than 91% of patients identifying as LGBTQ. Mandelman feels he and others in the gay community have been left to advocate on their own, without support from the federal government.  Desperate and fearful  For health care workers, the outbreak is a frustrating new chapter after the punishing Covid-19 pandemic.  “At the peak of Covid vaccinations, we averaged 1,400 to 1,500 (doses) a day. So we are completely used to the mass vaccination process,” nurse manager Merjo Roca said.   But Roca and her staff are limited in what they can do given the vaccine shortage.   San Francisco health officials initially requested 35,000 doses, but say they’ve only gotten 12,000 from the federal stockpile. The state of California informed city leaders that San Francisco will receive 10,700 more in the next allotment, yet there’s no clear indication when those doses will arrive or how many will reach San Francisco General Hospital for distribution.  “I think one of our biggest challenges is really just the inconsistency of the supply,” Roca said. “Our vaccine clinic prides itself on being able to help and vaccinate people when they come through our doors. So, it’s super hard for all of our staff not to be able to do that and have to turn people away and not even have information to say when we will get the doses next.”  With many of those in line fearful about monkeypox’s rapid rise in cases, the clinic staff feel an added burden by not being able to deliver for everyone.   “It’s very hard to listen to someone explaining why they want the vaccine and why they need the vaccine and we just don’t have it,” Roca added.  “It was like someone taking a hole-puncher all over my body”   The government argues it acted urgently and with the data. And there are clear differences between the response now and the response to HIV/AIDS. But some advocates say the perceived lack of governmental urgency in addressing a public health crisis that impacts queer communities today mirrors what gay men were experiencing decades ago.  Between October 1980 and May 1981, five young men from across Los Angeles – described by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time as “active homosexuals” – were diagnosed with an unusual lung infection and two of them died.   It was the first time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  – the devastating advanced-stage of HIV infection that would go on to claim the lives of more than 40 million people globally – was first reported in the US.  Exchanges between then-President Ronald Reagan’s press secretary and reporters in 1982 and 1983 indicate that the nation’s top officials and mainstream society viewed the disease as a joke and not an issue of great concern.  That stemmed from the perception of AIDS as a “gay plague” – a condition thought to be tied to the lifestyles and behaviors of gay men – even though cases had also been reported in women, infants, those with hemophilia and people who injected drugs.  Now, more than 40 years later, the gay community is once again grappling with feeling ostracized and neglected by their own government.  “We have a responsibility to not further stigmatize or politicize this issue for a community that has long faced many issues, has long been marginalized in our community,” said Tyler TerMeer, CEO of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. “Dating all the way back to the earliest days of the HIV epidemic in our country, we saw our community abandoned by federal government in their response,” he said.  The foundation opened its doors in 1982 “in a moment of crisis in our community, when the federal government abandoned us … there are parallels between that moment and this one,” according to TerMeer. “President Biden has called on us to explore every option on the table to combat the monkeypox outbreak and protect communities at risk,” said White House National Monkeypox Response Coordinator Robert Fenton. “We are applying lessons learned from the battles we’ve fought – from COVID response to wildfires to measles, and will tackle this outbreak with the urgency this moment demands.”   Monkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox and cowpox and it generally causes pimple- or blister-like lesions and flu-like symptoms such as fever, according to the CDC.  The lesions typically concentrate on the arms and legs, but in the latest outbreak, they’re showing up more frequently on the genital and perianal area, which has raised some concerns that monkeypox lesions may be confused with STDs.  “I had between 600 to 800 lesions all over my body … It was like someone taking a hole-puncher all over my body. There were points where I couldn’t walk, couldn’t touch things,” said Kevin Kwong, who recently recovered from monkeypox after being diagnosed in early July.  He chronicled his ordeal on social media to bring awareness to the outbreak and now wants to “focus on destigmatizing the gay community.”  The first case of monkeypox in the US was announced on May 18 in a patient hospitalized in Massachusetts who had traveled to Canada in private transportation.  Less than three months later there are more than 7,000 confirmed cases of the outbreak across the country, identified in all but two states – Montana and Wyoming, according to the CDC.   Since the start of June, the CDC says it has been doing extensive education and outreach to the LGBTQ community, including working with local Pride organizations, releasing educational videos and creating campaigns on social media sites and dating apps popular in the gay community.  According to the World Health Organization, there have been 25,054 cases confirmed by a laboratory as of August 3, and 122 probable cases. “For the moment this is an outbreak that’s concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those who have multiple partners,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in late July when WHO declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern.  But while the outbreak has disproportionately impacted some gay communities, there is growing concern over the spread of infection.   The CDC in late July reported the first two monkeypox cases in children. Two other pediatric cases have been confirmed in Indiana, and another in Long Beach, California, earlier this week.  “This is a reminder that everyone, regardless of age or sexual orientation, can get monkeypox if they come into contact with the virus,” the City of Long Beach cautioned, echoing CDC guidance that while the risk of infection in children is low, they are “more likely to be exposed to monkeypox if they live in or have recently traveled to a community with higher rates of infection.”  There are over 500 cases of the outbreak identified across California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York and Texas, the latest CDC figures show. New York has the distinction of having the most cases – 1,748 – followed by California with 826 confirmed cases.  “We need everyone to be rallying behind this issue and quickly,” TerMeer said “There is an imminent window of time by which we can get ahead of the fast spread of monkeypox across our country and that window continues to close.” CNN’s Harmeet Kaur, Augie Martin, Jen Christiansen,

285,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/world/zawahiri-death-settles-9-11-score-biden-analysis/,"For a few hours, America’s first war of the 21st century – the war on terror – returned to supersede the stirrings of a geopolitical showdown set to dominate the coming decades: a super power face-off with China.  In a blast from a previous foreign policy era, the US announced Monday that it had killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in Afghanistan, settling one of the last outstanding debts of vengeance after the September 11, 2001 attacks.  The killing was seized upon by President Joe Biden as validation of his vow to prevent the war-torn South Asian country from again becoming a safe haven for terrorists, despite ending America’s longest war there last year. And it may offer a steadying moment as the anniversary of his disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal nears, adding to his presidency’s momentum after Senate Democrats struck a deal on a climate, energy and health care bill last week.  More broadly, the attack, which hearkens back to the war on terror but coincides with a moment of soaring US tensions with Beijing, underscores a profound pivot in US national security policy. At one time, finding terrorists who attacked America wherever they were hiding was the organizing principle of Washington’s approach to the world. While Monday’s news was a “mission accomplished” moment, simmering tensions over Taiwan show how the US government is now building a new national security machine to challenge China’s rising power. A significant moment  There is deep symbolism in the killing of Zawahiri, an Egyptian surgeon turned radical Islamic ideologue who was wanted by the US for years even before the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.  Zawahiri was indicted by the FBI for his alleged role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which heralded a new age of al Qaeda terrorism directed against Americans. He had a key role in the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. Successive presidents vowed to bring the leaders of bin Laden’s terrorist network to justice, and Biden is the latest to have done so, in one of the few common threads in recent US foreign policy spanning administrations. “Now justice has been done. This terrorist leader is no more,” the President said, addressing the nation from his Covid-19 isolation on a balcony overlooking the South lawn of the White House on Monday evening. If Zawahiri lacked the charisma and mobilizing power of bin Laden, killed in a daring US Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan in 2011, his influence and organization of al Qaeda resulted in huge damage to the US. His demise validates American vows to pursue its enemies to the end of the earth.  “In many ways, it bookends the operation to go after bin Laden,” former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday.  He added that the loss of Zawahiri means al Qaeda no longer has the leadership structure to pose a threat to the United States or its allies. A bonus for a wobbling presidency  More immediately, the death of Zawahiri represents a significant moment for Biden and his wobbling presidency.  It may go some way to purge painful memories of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan a year ago. It may help the administration recast what are likely to be damning anniversary reviews of that foreign policy failure later this month. And more importantly, the strike backs up Biden’s claim to be able to target US enemies in Afghanistan from “over the horizon” – part of his argument that America no longer needs to maintain large land armies on foreign battlefields.  While Zawahiri was unable to reconstitute al Qaeda after the death of bin Laden to its former power, the circumstances of his death stand as a warning to other terrorist groups in Afghanistan and elsewhere. However, the fact that Zawahiri was apparently killed in an attack on a house in the center of Kabul raises real concerns that Afghanistan – back under Taliban control – is yet again harboring al Qaeda.  But it also shows that the US has intelligence capabilities in Afghanistan despite the exit of US diplomats, military and intelligence officials from the country last year. Biden chose the more optimistic takeaway, arguing that the operation proved his promise that he would not allow Afghanistan to again become a safe haven for terrorists. Presidents typically don’t take life-and-death decisions about national security to massage their own approval ratings – at least most of them don’t. But they all operate in a political context because of their position. There is no doubt that Biden could benefit incrementally from his commander-in-chief moment on television, reporting from the White House to Americans about the killing of an enemy.  The drone strike in Kabul came as Biden was being assailed by Republicans as weak and incapable. During the US departure from Afghanistan, Biden’s reputation as a safe pair of hands on foreign policy took a hit as Americans watched scenes of desperate refugees falling to their deaths from departing US planes, and the US military admitted to a botched drone strike that killed 10 Afghan civilians – including seven children.  But it’s also unlikely that Monday’s news will do much to alter the fate of Democrats in November’s midterm elections, who fear heavy losses amid new signs the economy could plunge into recession and following months of punishing high inflation. Foreign policy victories can be fleeting, and decapitating terror groups no longer brings the political payoff that it did when then-President George W. Bush was keeping score in the years after 9/11.  It may take a few days to fully assess how Zawahiri was located and to confirm the White House versions of events. On occasion, administrations have gotten details wrong or out of context in early readouts. Biden’s assurance that no civilians were killed in the drone strike could not immediately be confirmed.  In an increasingly polarized nation, the killing could offer a rare moment of unity – even if the distance from the 9/11 attacks and the relatively low profile of Zawahiri didn’t send crowds to chant outside the White House as was the case when bin Laden was killed. Still, any satisfaction over the killing of Zawahiri is likely to be soon overtaken by a more multilayered and urgent US conundrum abroad – the possibility of a standoff over Taiwan that threatens to erupt even as the US wages an effective proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. US and Taiwanese officials have said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to defy increasingly irate warnings in Beijing and fly into Taipei. Some foreign policy experts fear the trip could provoke an unprecedented Chinese response.

539,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-killings-tuesday/,"Albuquerque police have detained and charged a man they say is the “primary suspect” in the killings of four Muslim men, Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina tweeted Tuesday. The man has been identified as Muhammad Syed, 51, according to a police news release.  The killings took place between November 2021 and August of this year, with the latest three occurring within the span of two weeks. All of the victims were of South Asian descent. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES Authorities detained Syed, then searched his home and vehicle, which ultimately led them to discover “additional evidence that further tied Syed to the murders,” the release said. Police said during a news conference Tuesday that the findings included evidence that shows Syed knew the victims to some extent and that an interpersonal conflict may have led to the shootings. Medina told reporters Tuesday the department did not want to label the shootings a hate crime or attribute the actions to a serial killer because “it would’ve been irresponsible for us as a police department to say that and further drive fear into a community that was already in fear.”  “We still don’t have any indication that either of these topics or labels would’ve been appropriate,” Medina said. As detectives prepared to search Syed’s home in southeast Albuquerque, Syed drove from the home in a Volkswagen Jetta that detectives believe was used in at least one of the killings, the release said.  “Detectives connected those homicides using bullet casings found at the scenes,” the release said. “The gun used in those shootings was discovered during the overnight search of his (Syed’s) home.”   Syed has been charged in connection with the killings Aftab Hussein on July 26 and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain on August 1, the release said. Medina said detectives are working with the District Attorney’s Office on potential charges for the November 2021 killing of Mohammad Ahmadi and the August 5 killing of Naeem Hussain. “This has been a tough week for our community,” Medina said. “But we all pitched in to solve these crimes and protect a community that felt like it was under attack.”  Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez said Tuesday that his office and the police department plan to file the murder charges in district court.  “We are also working with our federal partners on the possibility of filing and pursuing federal charges at the same time if there is an appropriate federal statute,” Torrez said. Albuquerque Police, the Bernalillo County District Attorney’s Office and the Albuquerque mayor’s office did not respond to CNN requests for comment. While police have not provided details on exactly how the killings unfolded, they have said three of the victims – Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27; Aftab Hussein, 41, and Mohammad Ahmadi, 62 – were “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed.” Then, after community members marked a somber Friday prayer followed by a funeral for two of the victims, a fourth man – Naeem Hussain, 25 – was found dead, hours after attending the service. He became the third Muslim man killed in the city within two weeks and the fourth since November. While police have not definitively said all four attacks are connected, they have said they are looking into whether that is the case. With no one in custody, police have not commented on any possible motive or whether any of the shootings are being investigated as hate crimes.  However, it is “deeply troubling” that the victims were Muslim and of similar descent, Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the city police department’s criminal investigations division, has said. Police have not come out with any descriptions of a suspect or suspects in the killings. They have, however, said they are seeking “a vehicle of interest,” which may be connected to the four killings. The vehicle is a dark silver sedan that police say may be a Volkswagen Jetta. But it remains unclear whom the car belongs to, or where it was in the photos released by the department. Police said the vehicle “is suspected as being used as a conveyance in recent homicides of 4 Muslim men.” “Everyone believes that that vehicle is very key to what happened in at least two of the shootings,” Mayor Timothy Keller told CNN on Monday. “We also have shell casings that we’re able to tie together through the national database. So that is giving us some confidence. But we may have a long way to go.”  A $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest or arrests in the killings. Authorities have also set up an online portal for residents to upload videos and images that could help investigators.  The ambush-style killings The three most recent killings claimed the lives of men from Pakistan, and the spate of shootings directed investigators’ attention to an unsolved killing of an Afghan man reported in 2021. The latest killing happened just before midnight on August 5 in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue. Police responded to reports of a shooting and found Naeem Hussain dead from a gunshot wound.  He had attended the funeral of two other victims that same day and expressed concern about the shootings, according to a spokesman with a mosque in Albuquerque. On August 1, officers found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain on a sidewalk around 9:19 p.m. in the area of Cornell Street and Lead Avenue. He had been shot and died as a result of his wounds, police said. On July 26, officers found Aftab Hussein with apparent gunshot wounds in the 400 block of Rhode Island at 10:30 p.m. He also died as a result of his wounds, according to police. The August 1 and July 26 shootings got police looking into whether they may be connected to another killing that happened November 7. That day, officers found an Afghan man, Mohammad Ahmadi, with a gunshot wound in the parking lot behind the business he ran with his brother. “Our homicide detectives and our investigators currently believe there is a strong possibility that the same individual committed all three of these crimes,” Hartsock said last week, referring to the shootings of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Mohammad Ahmadi. “While we won’t go into why we think that, there’s one strong commonality in all of our victims – their race and religion. “We are taking this very serious and we want the public’s help in identifying this cowardly individual who in all three cases ambushed their victims with no warning, fired shots and killed them,” Hartsock added. Albuquerque’s Muslim community living in fear   The killings have put the city’s Muslim community on edge, with some too afraid go to the mosque, shop for food or sit outside, according to Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico. Assed said he too is now among the many Muslims in New Mexico grappling with fear every day. “I get in the car, and I’m watching every which way possible. I’m watching my side mirror. I’m looking in the back. I’m looking out for any sign of anything out of the ordinary,” he said. After hearing the news of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain’s death, a Muslim mother of nine in Albuquerque told her children, “‘I don’t want you leaving the home after a certain hour,’” the mother, Samia Assed, told CNN on Tuesday. “I have been vigilant outside. We watch ourselves. We don’t go out. Our daily routines have changed,” she said. The city is now increasing police presence at mosques, Muslim-affiliated schools and the University of New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also announced sending additional state police to Albuquerque. “We’ve got extra police patrols at every mosque during prayer time. We’re delivering meals to folks afraid to come out of their homes. We’re providing trauma services for folks also in their home or at their mosque for what they’re going through,” Keller said. “Right now these are very, very trying times for this community and our city.” Who the victims were Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had just become a US citizen last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami. The young man, who owned a trucking business, was described as a kind, generous and hardworking person. Muhammad Afzaal Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor. “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Española Mayor John Ramon Vigil said. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.” Few details have been released about the two other victims.",Michelle Lujan Grisham;Khader Abdele Rahman;Ehsan Shahalami;Aftab Hussein;Aftab Hussein;Aftab

225,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/us/gun-laws-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. Gregory Jackson is intimately familiar with gun violence. He said that while he was walking along N Street in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, DC, about nine years ago, he was shot in his right leg by a man who mistook Jackson for someone else.  The experience forever changed Jackson. At the time, he was the southern regional director of Organizing for Action, a group that championed then-President Barack Obama’s agenda. Jackson recalled how the police interrogated him in his hospital bed. They treated him, a Black man, not as a victim but instead like a perpetrator – like a security risk to be monitored.  It took him six months to learn to walk again. Jackson is now the executive director of the nonprofit organization the Community Justice Action Fund, and his passion for gun violence prevention feels even more salient today. Gun control legislation remains minimal at the federal level, though, crucially, just last month, President Joe Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first significant federal gun safety legislation passed in nearly 30 years. Meanwhile, some Democratic-controlled state legislatures are designing laws to confront the recent spike in gun violence. However, some observers worry about the potential unintended consequences of such laws, which have at times in the past contributed to mass incarceration and disproportionately harmed Black Americans. “There’s definitely a tension between our biased criminal legal system and some of the sentencing-focused policies we’ve seen implemented over the years,” Jackson told CNN. “That’s why we’re pushing for a public-health response to gun violence, which means that it should be people centered and resource driven, not necessarily about carceral strategies or restrictive policies.” In short, he wants policing to play a smaller role in gun control. Jackson added that he has little interest in directing resentment toward the man who shot him. “What I have more resentment for is, How did that individual gain access to the firearm? Why is it so easy for people in my community to get a gun? It’s easier to get a gun in my neighborhood than it is to get a library book or a healthy meal,” Jackson said. There’s no easy way to curb gun violence. But experts say that “cleaning up policing” and shrinking our reliance on the criminal justice system are important pieces of the puzzle. ‘We’ve got to clean up policing’ The issue when it comes to gun control isn’t necessarily the law, according to Carol Anderson, an African American studies professor at Emory University. Sometimes, the issue is the enforcement of the law. “Let’s go back to the Bruen decision in New York, that horrible decision by the US Supreme Court,” Anderson said, referring to the high court’s ruling in June that struck down a century-old New York gun law and that observers suspect will unleash a wave of lawsuits seeking to loosen restrictions at the state and federal levels. “The amicus curiae brief from public defenders said, The NYPD has used this law to go after Black folks. Look at what this has done.” Anderson, the author of “The Second: Race and Guns in a Fatally Unequal America,” said that, at the core, the problem was policing. “That’s the component I don’t think is understood well enough,” she said. “We’ve got to clean up policing. Until we take anti-Blackness seriously, we’re going to keep dancing around the issue.”  Following the Bruen decision, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law limiting the concealed carry of firearms in locations such as schools. Yet some observers have expressed concern that the new law, though certainly well meaning, might nourish age-old biases. “Instead of going after manufacturers, all those other sort of top-level issues, continuing to focus on individual possession cases where the police are in charge of that enforcement just ensures that we’re going to continue to see the over-criminalization of Black and brown New Yorkers,” the civil rights attorney MK Kaishian recently told City & State. Sharone Mitchell Jr., the chief public defender of Cook County, Illinois, a state with comparatively rigid gun control laws, echoed some of Kaishian’s sentiments. “What we’re seeing is an influx of possession cases, and these arrests are happening in very specific neighborhoods, mainly through stops of cars and seizures in searches of cars,” Mitchell told CNN, stressing that “the reality of the situation is the way we’re pursuing gun laws that haven’t affected the supply of or demand for guns.” He also noted that his view puts him in an uncomfortable position, because he’s “not a gun person” and doesn’t own a gun. Like Anderson and Kaishian, Mitchell pointed out the challenge that policing can pose. “What we’re seeing is the police saying, Listen, if we can’t stop gun violence, then we just need to arrest as many people as possible and hope that that has some type of effect,” Mitchell said. “Also, there are PR benefits to being able to say, We pulled 14,000 guns off the street, without giving the denominator. There are hundreds of thousands of guns on the street.” Charting a path forward How to address gun violence without further criminalizing Black Americans, especially when the manufacturers of guns enjoy such broad immunity from regulation? For starters, we must recognize that while even well-intentioned gun control laws can disproportionately harm Black communities, there’s a flip side. “It’s important to keep in mind whenever you’re thinking about new criminal laws what the potential impact could be on different communities,” Eric Ruben, an assistant professor at SMU Dedman School of Law and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, told CNN. “But there’s also a disparate impact on Black and brown communities of not regulating guns. Gun violence, which gun laws seek to address, disparately threatens Black and brown communities.” Second Amendment advocates such as Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, who’s one of two Black Republican men serving in the House of Representatives and who fervently opposes the federal bipartisan bill, lament the impact of the US’ gun control laws. “Gun laws haven’t made Black communities safer,” Donalds said, recounting how he was held up at gunpoint when he was a 16-year-old in Brooklyn. “There was nobody around. If there were people in the vicinity who were armed, who saw something wrong going on, does a criminal element think twice about so freely using guns to cause violence or commit a crime?”  Much evidence shows that boosting gun ownership doesn’t actually stop crime, and that failing to regulate has a cost. Scotching false narratives matters, too. For instance, Republican lawmakers often attempt to paint Democratic-controlled states as hellscapes uniquely afflicted by gun violence, despite the fact that, per data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, red states have some of the highest firearm mortality rates in the country. GOP lawmakers’ deflection also ignores the ease with which people can export guns from states with looser gun control laws – red states, usually – to neighboring states with stricter laws. “There’s so much myth-busting that has to happen,” Anderson said. “We’ve got to dismantle anti-Blackness as an operating code for our public policy.” Further, we can learn something from previous attempts to rein in gun violence, particularly the reliance on involving the criminal justice system. “The 1994 crime bill taught one unfortunate lesson, which was that there had been this intersection between regulating guns through unnecessarily long prison sentences that contributed to mass incarceration,” Ruben told CNN. “One of the things that I think you see now is that there are lots of solutions getting advocated for that are trying to minimize the intersection between regulation and harsh penal sentences. There’s even an attempt to try to come up with solutions that don’t get the criminal justice system involved at all.” He said that extreme risk protection orders, aka red flag laws, which are meant to be civil, are one means toward this end. A worried family member or law enforcement can petition to have a firearm removed from somebody who might be a risk to themselves or other people. If successful, the order is completely civil. Community violence intervention programs offer another opportunity to confront gun violence while minimizing interactions between high-risk communities and the criminal justice system. These programs, Ruben said, could make a big impact, and are getting funded by the new federal bill. It’s this tactical pivot from prior approaches to gun violence prevention that the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in some ways represents that gives Jackson some hope. “I’m encouraged because this bill does a really strong job of investing in programs to save lives,” Jackson told CNN, referring to how the bill allocates $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs and also closes the so-called boyfriend loophole, among other things that support Black communities, in particular. “We do a lot of work to make sure that the legislation and the policies are focused on healing communities, preventing violence and supporting those who are on both sides of the gun,” he added, “as opposed to simply trying to incarcerate our way out of the problem.”",Eric

543,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/entertainment/hamilton-unauthorized-production-texas-church-cec/,"A Texas church performed “Hamilton” this weekend, but the team behind the Tony-award winning production says it shouldn’t have happened.  “‘Hamilton’ does not grant amateur or professional licenses for any stage productions and did not grant one to The Door Church,” Shane Marshall Brown, a spokesperson for “Hamilton,” said in a statement to CNN on Monday.  Officials behind the musical were not aware of the “unauthorized staging” until the day after the church’s first of two scheduled performances and sent a cease-and-desist letter, the spokesperson added.  The Door, a church in McAllen, a town in South Texas, was allowed to continue with its planned second performance, with conditions, among them that the show would not be live streamed, recorded or shared on social media in photo or video form, according to the statement.  The Door performed “Hamilton” on Aug. 5 and 6 with edited content that included lyrical references to Jesus and Christianity throughout, according to footage of the production shared on social media. A sermon reportedly delivered to the audience also compared homosexuality to drug addiction, according to video.  In an additional statement provided to CNN late Monday, the spokesperson said they were not aware “of the extensive changes to the show or that there would be a sermon at the end” when they allowed Saturday’s performance to move forward.  “We have reserved all of our rights and are considering how to proceed based upon what we’ve learned,” the spokesperson’s statement said. “The Hamilton family stands for tolerance, compassion, inclusivity and certainly LGBTQ+ rights. We are in the process of reviewing the unauthorized changes made to the script to determine further action.”  CNN’s attempts to reach The Door for comment over the weekend and on Monday have gone unanswered.  Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Tony, Grammy and Emmy-winning smash that retells the tale of the “10-dollar founding father” Alexander Hamilton and his contemporaries with a cast mostly comprised of people of color.  It won both the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony for best musical, and its producers have launched productions on Broadway, in Chicago and in San Francisco, among other cities, not counting its multiple touring companies. It is not available for licensing to theater companies.  Per copyright law, churches do have an exemption that allows them to perform copyrighted music during religious services but that exemption does not allow for streaming or distribution of those performances and does not extend to any other public performances outside of service.  Much of the footage from the church’s first “Hamilton” performance was scrubbed from The Door’s social media accounts, per the production’s cease-and-desist request. But some clips were preserved online and shared by Hemant Mehta, a writer and atheist advocate.  In one clip, a character appears to read from the Bible while Hamilton is in crisis. The character tells him that “God is the only one that can help you right now.” In another clip, an actor playing Eliza Schuyler sings “My hope is in Jesus. If you could just give him a chance today, that would be enough.” Other footage shared by Mehta reportedly shows The Door pastor Victor Lopez addressing the audience on stage, with “Hamilton” sets behind him, and he says: “Maybe you struggle with alcohol, with drugs, homosexuality. Maybe you struggle with other things in life, your finances, whatever, relationships – God can help you tonight.”  “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda is a staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community and famously used his 2016 Tony Awards acceptance speech to read a sonnet that addressed the shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, that killed 50 people hours before the award show.  Miranda has not individually commented on the unauthorized production.  CNN has attempted to reach Lopez for comment. Some arts critics who weren’t attached to “Hamilton” took issue with the McAllen church’s unauthorized production and the changes to its text.  Howard Sherman, an arts administrator and writer who was one of the first users to widely share news of the production, said the rights of the artists behind “Hamilton” had been violated.  “The work of Lin Manuel [sic], Tommy Kail, Alex Lacamoire, Andy Blankenbuehler, David Korins and others cannot be taken for free or manipulated to send other messages,” he wrote. “I respect all faiths, but I cannot respect The Door McAllen for stealing material to serve their own purposes.” The statement from the spokesperson for “Hamilton” thanked the show’s “devoted fans” for “bringing this to our attention.” ",Lin Manuel;Tommy Kail;David Korins;Shane Marshall Brown;Lin-Manuel Miranda Tony;Eliza Schuyler;Howard Sherman;Alex Lacamoire;Hemant Mehta;Andy Blankenbuehler;Alexander Hamilton;Lin-Manuel Miranda;Lin-Manuel Miranda;Victor Lopez,Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Door Church,"TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTER,3545;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,3037;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,1917;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,773;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1015;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2702;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,773;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1015;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2702;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,773;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1015;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2702;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,297;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,539;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1218;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1496;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,4524;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4387;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4419;TAX_FNCACT_ARTISTS,4167;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,208;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3263;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2335;TAX_RELIGION_ATHEIST,2837;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCHES,2350;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2297;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,2297;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,2297;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,2297;RELIGION,2434;TAX_RELIGION_CHRISTIANITY,940;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,4057;WB_1406_DISEASES,1108;WB_1437_SOCIAL_DETERMINANTS_FOR_HEALTH,1108;WB_1438_ALCOHOL_AND_SUBSTANCE_ABUSE,1108;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,1108;TAX_FNCACT_WRITER,2827;TAX_FNCACT_WRITER,4066;TAX_FNCACT_PASTOR,3217;LGBT,1090;LGBT,3370;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,2339;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2339;WB_1040_COPYRIGHT_LAW,2339;WB_851_INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY_RIGHTS,2339;WB_1039_PROPERTY_LAWS_AND_REGULATIONS,2339;DRUG_TRADE,1098;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1098;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1098;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1098;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1098;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1098;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1098;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1098;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2932;KILL,3718;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,3718;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,19;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,257;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,455;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,568;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,2635;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,3965;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,362;LEGISLATION,2339;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2339;MEDIA_SOCIAL,773;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1015;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2702;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,773;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,1015;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2702;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,773;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,1015;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2702;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,773;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,1015;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2702;TAX_FNCACT_MARSHALL,274;",San Francisco;Chicago;Texas,935
263,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/kyrsten-sinema-democrats-tax-questions-companies/,"Republican senators and the business community are mounting a full-court press on Sen. Kyrsten Sinema to sink – or substantially change – the Democrats’ economic package, arguing in private conversations that the new tax increases would hurt companies in her home state of Arizona. And in a private call with business groups on Tuesday, Sinema asked a question about the bill’s proposed 15% minimum tax on corporations that gave them some hope for optimism. “Is this written in a way that’s bad?” Sinema asked, according to Danny Seiden, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, who relayed the call to CNN.  “It gave me hope that she’s willing to open this up and maybe make it better,” Seiden said. Sinema’s office declined to comment about the call. But she has expressed concerns about other tax provisions as well – namely on raising taxes on so-called carried interest, which would impact private equity and hedge fund managers, and raise $14 billion in the Democrats’ bill. Sinema has relayed to top Democrats that she wants that provision out of the bill, according to a source familiar with the matter. Sinema, the lone holdout among the 50-member Senate Democratic Caucus and who was blindsided by news of the deal last week, has refused to tip her hand one way or the other on the bill – giving conservative critics of the bill reason to believe they could convince her to change her mind. Democrats are still confident that they can win her over but also acknowledge that they may have to make some changes – particularly over the tax provisions – to get her to “yes.” But as she’s been in talks with Democrats who have touted the bill’s benefits, Republicans like Senate Minority Whip John Thune have expressed concerns to her about the taxes on companies and the proposal to hire new IRS agents to bolster tax enforcement. “She’s analyzing it,” the South Dakota Republican said of Sinema. “Keeps her own counsel, I think as most of you know, and usually comes to her own decisions, pretty independent of any pressure that she might get from either side. So you know, I think she’s going through that process right now.” At a news conference on Wednesday, where Republican senators railed against the proposed tax hikes, Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo said senators were privately making the same case to Sinema. “We are making this case that we’ve made here to you today as aggressively as we can,” Crapo said. On Wednesday, Sinema indicated to CNN that she was in no hurry to announce her position on the bill. “Taking my time,” she said. Her spokesperson reiterated that Sinema was waiting for the review by the Senate parliamentarian to be completed before announcing her position. But last fall, Sinema indicated her support for a corporate minimum tax, saying at the time that it’s a “common sense” proposal to ensure that “highly profitable corporations” pay their share of taxes. The proposal was developed last fall with her input after she rejected calls to raise corporate income tax rates, a Democratic aide said Wednesday. In the private call with Sinema on Tuesday, Seiden expressed the business community’s opposition to the 15% tax provision, noting it would particularly hit manufacturers that take advantage of an accelerated depreciation tax deduction that lowers their tax burden. (Seiden said National Association of Manufacturers president Jay Timmons was also on the call; A NAM representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Seiden told CNN that Sinema did not “tip her hand” on any particular provision, asked for more information on how the bill affects Arizona, but asked that question, which gave him hope that she would be open to somehow amending the bill’s tax proposals. “She did not tip her hand, tip her hat, in any way, shape or form,” Seiden said. “It was a pure listening moment for her, collecting information, soliciting information, just like any good representative would do.” In the meantime, she’s hearing arguments from both sides. On the Senate floor Tuesday night, a number of senators from both parties approached the senator, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia.  Democratic leaders acknowledge they are uncertain where she will come down. “She didn’t tell me or give me any signals as to where she’s going on this bill,” Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip, said of a recent conversation he had with the senator. “We need her, we need every single vote, so I hope she’ll be with us.” While Democrats say the bill would ensure large corporations don’t avoid paying taxes, instilling “fairness” into the tax code, the Arizona Chamber president argued that a minimum corporate tax makes the code “overly complicated.” Seiden said that raising taxes during a recession is particularly unpopular and would inject more uncertainty into the marketplace. “The meeting went great,” said Seiden of his call with Sinema. “She knows that our businesses are struggling, because of inflation, because of supply chain issues. So anything that will impact or make that worse or halt the economic growth that we’ve seen, she’s very sensitive towards that.” Seiden thanked Sinema for her work on the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the recent legislation boosting semiconductor manufacturing, but said the “the celebration of the Chips Act is short-lived” if some of the tax provisions remain untouched in the bill negotiated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. Seiden said he would like to see some of the energy and environmental pieces go through without the “poison pill” tax provisions, acknowledging that some elements of the energy sector support provisions like the tax credits for electric vehicles. Nikola Corporation and Lucid Group, two electric vehicle manufacturers, have operations in Arizona. Corporations are hoping that Sinema, the crucial vote in the 50-50 Senate, will make changes to the bill, pointing to her previous statements. In April, Sinema told the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, “I am unwilling to support any tax policies that would put a break on that type of economic growth, or stall business and personal growth for America’s industries.” “You all know, the entire country knows, that I am opposed to raising the corporate income tax,” Sinema said. “That was true yesterday and it is true today.” Sinema already has effectively pushed back on raising personal and corporate tax rates in President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, one reason she is being attacked by the left.   If she doesn’t back the bill, a potential 2024 challenger warned it would come back to haunt her. “I think there’s going to be some consequences at the ballot box for her,” said Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who has expressed interest in possibly mounting a primary campaign against Sinema. John LaBombard, a former Sinema spokesperson, said that Sinema is looking for “good, effective policy that is not going to carry any unintended consequences” and would be “impervious” to political considerations. “I’ve not met someone more impervious to political pressure than Kyrsten Sinema,” LaBombard said.

50,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/texas-dps-uvalde-shooting-investigation/,"The Texas Department of Public Safety investigation into the Uvalde elementary school shooting will include an internal review of the actions taken by every DPS officer on the scene to determine whether they should be referred to the inspector general for investigation, Texas DPS Director Steven McCraw said Thursday. “Every one of our officers will undergo scrutiny by the DA and an internal investigation – just because they didn’t violate the law, doesn’t mean they acted appropriately based on our policy,” said McCraw. McCraw said agencies involved in the investigation include the DPS, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell Busbee’s office is also involved, since she is “ultimately the customer,” he said, adding, “It’s our job to provide them timely investigative data.” Officers responded to Robb Elementary School just minutes after the shooting began on May 24, but waited for over an hour outside adjoining classrooms before finally entering and killing the 18-year-old gunman, according to a DPS timeline. The massacre left 19 children and two teachers dead.  On Thursday, McCraw again called the law enforcement response to the shooting an “abject failure,” echoing the statement he made while testifying before the Texas Senate.  The director said he has not yet reviewed video from all 34 body cameras – noting that he may have to correct that number in the future – but he has seen certain excerpts.  All DPS agents who arrived at the school as well as troopers and one of the special agents had a body camera, according to McCraw, however, some of the officers outside of the building may have not activated them. Not all officers inside the building were outfitted with cameras because not all agencies responding had cameras, he added.   All the ballistics reports are complete and most of the DNA tests are complete, McCraw said. The director said he is not publicly releasing any information in accordance with the district attorney’s request and acknowledged that the case could take years, depending on whether Busbee decides to prosecute any of the officers. “In all investigations, the last thing you want to do is undermine the prosecuting attorney and her ability to prosecute the case,” said McCraw. “It is important to do a thorough investigation, especially when law enforcement officers are involved.” DPS has given video to the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) Center, an active shooter and attack response training provider at Texas State University, for their assessment on tactical efficacy of the operation, said McCraw. Several Texas senators also requested material through non-disclosure agreements, McCraw said.  The department would have provided information to Texas Sen. Roland Gutierrez if he had signed a confidentiality agreement, but Gutierrez was not willing to sign one and “was not happy” with that offer, McCraw said. Gutierrez filed a suit in June saying DPS failed to respond to a public information request.",Christina Mitchell Busbee;Roland Gutierrez;Steven Mccraw,Texas Department Of Public Safety;Robb Elementary School;Texas State University;Texas Senate;Bureau Of Alcohol;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_TROOPERS,1771;KILL,1085;TAX_FNCACT_SENATORS,3191;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3191;TAX_WEAPONS_EXPLOSIVES,691;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,325;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,1555;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,2451;TAX_FNCACT_INSPECTOR,278;EDUCATION,120;EDUCATION,942;EDUCATION,1253;EDUCATION,1336;EDUCATION,1751;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,120;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,942;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1253;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1336;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1751;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,120;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,942;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1253;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1336;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1751;TERROR,1107;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,71;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,304;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,440;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,607;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2860;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,71;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,304;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,440;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,607;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2860;WB_840_JUSTICE,71;WB_840_JUSTICE,304;WB_840_JUSTICE,440;WB_840_JUSTICE,607;WB_840_JUSTICE,2860;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,71;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,304;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,440;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,607;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2860;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,71;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,304;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,440;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,607;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2860;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,71;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,304;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,440;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,607;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2860;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,71;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,304;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,440;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,607;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,2860;TAX_FNCACT_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY,732;TAX_FNCACT_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY,2542;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1186;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1186;USPEC_POLICY1,539;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,539;TAX_FNCACT_INSPECTOR_GENERAL,286;TAX_FNCACT_AGENTS,1725;TAX_FNCACT_AGENTS,1797;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,42;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,42;ARMEDCONFLICT,1151;ARMEDCONFLICT,1202;ARMEDCONFLICT,1285;ARMEDCONFLICT,2152;ARMEDCONFLICT,2298;TRIAL,732;TRIAL,2542;TRIAL,2762;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,732;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2542;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2762;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3090;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,380;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,906;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,1870;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,1940;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,2667;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,2903;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,380;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,906;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1870;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,1940;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,2667;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,2903;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2829;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2104;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2250;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2104;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2250;SECURITY_SERVICES,1411;SECURITY_SERVICES,2894;SECURITY_SERVICES,2970;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1411;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2894;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2970;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1411;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,2894;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,2970;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1411;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,2894;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,2970;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,203;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,203;LEGISLATION,480;LEGISLATION,1399;LEGISLATION,2882;LEGISLATION,2958;EPU_POLICY_LAW,480;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1399;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2882;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2958;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2071;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2217;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1168;",Robb Elementary School;Uvalde;Texas Department Of Public Safety;Texas,591
364,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/middleeast/al-qaeda-new-leader-options-intl/,"Ayman al-Zawahiri’s death at the hands of a US drone strike has raised questions about who will replace him as the leader of al Qaeda.  While the terrorist group is not short of contenders, its ranks are sparser and more geographically dispersed than 10 or 20 years ago. Here’s what we know about who could be the next Al Qaeda leader. The longtime insider The man tipped by many analysts to be Zawahiri’s successor is Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian commando who is one of the last survivors of al Qaeda’s “founding generation” and has spent much of the past two decades in Iran.   Adel was a loyal servant to Osama bin Laden before acting as al Qaeda’s interim leader in 2011. He organized the succession process in favor of Zawahiri because that was bin Laden’s wish – even though Adel himself might have been a more effective choice as competition from ISIS grew in the following years.  Saif al-Adel is his nom de guerre, which translates as Sword of Justice. It’s not the only mystery about the man.  There are just a couple of purported photographs of him in existence. He is said to have faked his death in his 20s. His status in Iran has also been unclear: sometimes detained, sometimes under house arrest, sometimes at liberty.  Ali Soufan, former FBI special agent and author of “Anatomy of Terror: From the Death of bin Laden to the Rise of the Islamic State,” describes Adel as the ultimate insider, someone well-connected across many countries, and a shrewd military tactician. For much of his adult life he has lived and breathed al Qaeda.  Soufan wrote in the Combating Terrorism Center’s Sentinel journal recently that Adel played “a central role in audacious attacks from the ‘Black Hawk Down’ incident in Somalia to the bombings of US embassies in East Africa and the suicide attack on the destroyer the USS Cole.” “When he acts, he does so with ruthless efficiency,” Soufan added. “Above all, he is a pragmatist – a man who would have known that despite the hateful necessity of living under a [Shia] government anathema to Sunni [al Qaeda], his best chance of survival, and therefore of continued effectiveness in the jihad, lay in a return to Iran.”  Soufan also notes that al-Adel was a mentor to the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose organization later morphed into ISIS.  “Saif as emir would enjoy a rare opportunity to attract some former Islamic State members back into [al Qaeda],” Soufan suggests.   The Africa affiliates A UN expert report earlier this year contended that others in the running for al Qaeda’s leadership were from the organization’s robust African affiliates.  It mentioned three possible candidates besides al-Adel: Abdal-Rahman al-Maghrebi; Yazid Mebrak, the head of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); and Ahmed Diriye, the leader of Shabaab in Somalia.  Maghrebi would, as it were, keep it in the family, as he is Zawahiri’s son-in-law. But he is Moroccan in an organization historically dominated by Saudis and Egyptians.  He was named a specially designated global terrorist by the US State Department last year and described as the “long-time director” of As Sahab, al Qaeda’s media operation. He is 52.  In papers discovered at bin Laden’s Pakistani hideout, another senior figure in al Qaeda said Maghrebi “has high morals, he can keep a secret, and he is patient. His ideology is prudent, and he has excellent awareness.”  Mebrak, an Algerian, became leader of AQIM in 2020. He is also known as Abu Ubaydah Yusuf al-Anabi.  In designating him, the State Department said he “was expected to play a role in al Qaeda’s global management,” as did his predecessor as AQIM leader.  He is a veteran of jihad in the Sahel, where al Qaeda and ISIS groups compete for superiority.   Another affiliate to have survived despite the best efforts of the United States and a multinational east African force is al Shabaab in Somalia. It has been prone to internal rifts and its fortunes have swung wildly but it has survived a challenge from the budding ISIS. Diriye has been its leader since 2014, a tenure of unlikely longevity. Shabaab and al Qaeda have been united for a decade and Diriye was quick to pledge allegiance to Zawahiri when he became leader.   For al Qaeda, the appointment of a leader from Africa would be a cultural leap. Some former al Qaeda insiders say that senior Egyptian and Saudi figures within the organization often looked down on African affiliates.    Al Qaeda has only ever had two leaders and the current status of its governing Shura (council), which had a critical role in the election of Zawahiri, is hard to discern. When Zawahiri was selected, he had already been anointed by bin Laden as his successor but it still took some time to garner the “bayat”– the oath of loyalty – of far-flung members of the council. The working assumption among analysts is that members of the Shura may over the next few weeks begin to declare bayat to al Qaeda’s third leader. But the field of possible contenders has been whittled down over the years, especially with the deaths of bin Laden’s son Hamza and the murder in Iran of another prominent al Qaeda figure, Mohammed al Masri.  The leadership of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, has also been decimated by US and Saudi operations.  Can Al Qaeda reinvent itself? However, there may be opportunities for al Qaeda to reinvent itself – whether Adel becomes the next leader or al Qaeda turns to the next generation of battle-hardened African jihadis.  The UN panel of experts on international terrorism believes “the international context is favourable to [al Qaeda], which intends to be recognized again as the leader of global jihad.”  As ISIS has waned in the Middle East (although it retains a lethal presence through its African affiliates and has survived in parts of Syria and Iraq) “[al Qaeda] propaganda is now better developed to compete with ISIL [ISIS] as the key actor in inspiring the international threat,” the UN experts concluded.  Within Afghanistan, al Qaeda’s predominant presence has been in the south and east, though the UN experts noted that it may be seeking to establish a presence in western provinces bordering Iran.  Al Qaeda is not without friends within Afghanistan, beyond its long historical ties with the Haqqani Network, a powerful player within the Taliban regime. Its affiliates in Central Asia such as the Turkestan Islamic Party also retain a presence.  It seems likely that whoever succeeds Zawahiri, the group’s leadership will continue to have its center of gravity in Afghanistan so long as the Taliban rule the country, even if its many of its operations take place thousands of miles away. The successor’s task will be to re-establish the group’s relevance while harnessing disparate franchises across Asia, Africa and the Middle East – and perhaps inspiring a new generation to carry out attacks in its name in Western cities.

229,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/paul-pelosi-dui-charges-not-guilty-plea/,"Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury and driving with .08% blood alcohol level or higher causing injury.  His lawyer, Amanda Bevins, appeared on his behalf at an arraignment in Napa County Superior Court in California and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges, which were brought after Pelosi was arrested on May 28 after having been involved in a nighttime collision. Pelosi, who did not appear in court on Wednesday, will remain free on his own recognizance and is due back in court on August 23. The 82-year-old had been attempting to cross SR-29 in late May when his 2021 Porsche was hit by a 2014 Jeep traveling northbound on the road, according to a collision report from the California Highway Patrol. The vehicles “sustained major collision damage,” according to a criminal complaint. The complaint noted that Pelosi was operating his vehicle “while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage and a drug and under their combined influence.” Authorities said in the complaint that when asked for ID at the scene, Pelosi handed the officers both his license and an “11-99 Foundation” card. The foundation is the California Highway Patrol charity, which “provides emergency assistance to California Highway Patrol employees and scholarships to their children,” according to its website.  The punishment for the misdemeanor charges “includes up to five years of probation, a minimum of five days in jail, installation of an ignition interlock device, fines and fees, completion of a court ordered drinking driver class and other terms, according to a release from the Napa County District Attorney’s Office. Pelosi completed sobriety tests at the time of the incident “showing signs of impairment,” according to a criminal complaint. The criminal complaint noted that California Highway Patrol determined Pelosi “was the proximate cause of the collision.” A native of San Francisco, he has been married to Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, since 1963.

37,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/tech/spacex-debris-australia-scn/,"Chunks of space debris were reportedly found on farmland in the Australia mountains, and this week NASA and Australian authorities confirmed that the objects are “likely” a scrap of hardware from a SpaceX Dragon capsule that was intentionally jettisoned as the spacecraft reentered the Earth’s atmosphere last May.  SpaceX did not return a request for comment, and typically does not interact with news media. Local media reports said at least three pieces of debris have been recovered in the mountain range near Australia’s southernmost tip, and according to a statement from the Australian Space Agency, it “has confirmed the debris is from a SpaceX mission and continues to engage with our counterparts in the US, as well as other parts of the Commonwealth and local authorities as appropriate.” According to NASA’s statement, SpaceX also confirmed the debris is likely to be a part of the Dragon’s trunk. The trunk provides electricity and other necessary services to the main capsule during its time in orbit but is discarded as the main capsule slices back through the thick upper atmosphere on its way home. “The trunk segment … typically burns up in the atmosphere over the open ocean posing minimal risk to public safety,” according to a statement from the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses and oversees commercial spaceflight operations in the United States.  “In this case, it likely remained in orbit for more than one year and some pieces of trunk hardware survived to reach the Earth,” the FAA statement reads. SpaceX operates two types of Dragon spacecraft: one that is designed solely for shuttling food, research and other supplies to the International Space Station, and another, called Crew Dragon, that’s designed for carrying astronauts. The scraps of the Dragon trunk found in Australia were likely part of a the spacecraft that carried four astronauts home from the ISS on May 2, 2021, according to NASA. The Crew-1 astronauts — comprised of NASA’s Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and Soichi Noguchi, an astronaut with Japan’s space agency — made a safe return aboard the main portion of the capsule, which splashed down off the coast of Florida before being hauled to safety by nearby recovery ships last year. Members of the public that believe they may have found a piece of space debris can reach out to SpaceX’s recovery hotline at 1-866-623-0234 or at recovery@spacex.com. Typically, discarded pieces of space hardware fall to a watery grave in the ocean. But they do sometimes turn up on land. Last year, for example, what was believed to be a piece of a SpaceX rocket’s second stage — which powers the rocket after the lower first stage expends all its fuel — landed on a farm in Washington state. SpaceX does not attempt to recover the second stage of its rockets, though it does land, refurbish and refly most of its first-stage rocket boosters, which are the largest part of the rocket and give the initial boost at liftoff.

157,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/georgia-unborn-child-taxes/,"Georgians can now claim an “unborn child” as a dependent on their state taxes, the state’s Department of Revenue announced this week. Residents filing their 2022 tax returns who had fetuses with detectable heartbeats at six weeks of pregnancy can claim a dependent personal exemption in the amount of $3,000, the department said on Monday. The announcement follows the US Supreme Court’s landmark decision overturning Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion, and the subsequent ruling by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed a Georgia law banning abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy to take effect. Georgia House Bill 481 – dubbed the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act” – was signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019. It banned the procedure at six weeks, before many women know they’re pregnant. A federal judge then ruled it unconstitutional and blocked it. However, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, the federal appeals court allowed it to take effect. Under the law, embryos are considered “natural persons” with “full legal recognition” and “shall be included in certain population based determinations.” After the ruling, the definition of a dependent in Georgia was amended to include an “unborn child” with a detectable heartbeat – effective the date of the federal appeals court’s July 20 ruling, the Department of Revenue said.  Taxpayers will have to be prepared to provide “relevant medical records or other supporting documentation” to support the dependent deduction claimed, the department said. It did not specify what those documents would be. It’s unclear how the tax filings will play out for pregnancies that don’t come to term, or how it affects surrogates and unmarried parents living separately. The guidance released from the Revenue Department did not address miscarriages, but it said tax return instructions will be issued later this year.  The Georgia changes highlight the swirling debate over how to define “personhood” in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade. A federal judge recently blocked a “personhood” provision in an existing abortion ban in Arizona, forbidding the state from using it to impose penalties for abortions that would otherwise be legal under existing Arizona law. In Texas, a pregnant woman who got a ticket for driving in the HOV lane in Texas argued her pregnancy meant she was not alone in the car but in fact had a passenger. Texas has pushed to restrict abortion and has defined a fetus or unborn baby as a “person” in its penal code.",Brian Kemp,Department Of Revenue;Department Of Revenue;Us Supreme Court;Circuit Court;Revenue Department,"RATIFY,739;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,2273;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1473;GENERAL_HEALTH,1446;MEDICAL,1446;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,1446;ECON_TAXATION,162;ECON_TAXATION,1628;ECON_TAXATION,1853;EPU_POLICY_TAX,162;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1628;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1853;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,40;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1255;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2001;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,863;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,2035;CONSTITUTIONAL,461;TAX_ETHNICITY_GEORGIANS,10;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_GEORGIANS,10;BAN,575;USPEC_POLICY1,76;EPU_CATS_TAXES,76;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,825;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,753;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,753;LEGISLATION,567;LEGISLATION,739;LEGISLATION,1022;LEGISLATION,2242;EPU_POLICY_LAW,567;EPU_POLICY_LAW,739;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1022;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2242;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,231;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,612;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,2348;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,2484;",Arizona;Georgia;Georgians;Texas,513
237,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-vienna-talks-august/,"A new round of talks to try to salvage the Iran nuclear deal will convene in Vienna this week, although the Biden administration has low expectations for reaching a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations. Top European Union official Enrique Mora announced on Twitter Wednesday that he was heading to the Austrian capital to discuss returning to full implementation of the nuclear agreement on the basis of a proposal put forward by top EU diplomat Josep Borrell in recent weeks.  Rob Malley, the US special envoy for Iran, said Wednesday that he was preparing to travel to Vienna for discussions based on that proposal. “Our expectations are in check, but the United States welcomes EU efforts and is prepared for a good faith attempt to reach a deal. It will shortly be clear if Iran is prepared for the same,” he wrote on Twitter. A senior Biden administration official emphasized that they are not overly hopeful that the next round meetings will produce a breakthrough in the long-stalled efforts to revive the deal. The last round of indirect talks between Washington and Tehran, hosted in Doha in late June ended without any progress. A State Department spokesperson said they appreciated Borrell’s efforts, and noted the US has “been prepared to close a deal and immediately begin reimplementation based on the outline on the table since March.”  “In order to reach a deal, Iran will have to drop demands that are extraneous to the JCPOA,” the spokesperson said. “We hope that will be the case, though at this stage our overall expectations remain low.” They said they “positively responded” to Borrell’s invitation to gather in Vienna this week because “we believe it is important to support his efforts.” Tehran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani, who is leading the Iranian delegation to Vienna for the talks, said Wednesday “the Onus is on those who breached the deal & have failed to distance from ominous legacy.” “The US must seize the opportunity offered by the JCPOA partners’ generosity; ball is in their court to show maturity & act responsibly,” he wrote on Twitter. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani “emphasized the determination of Iran to reach a strong agreement that guarantees the rights and interests of the Iranian nation,” a statement said.  The United States withdrew from the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018 under former President Donald Trump. In the wake of the US withdrawal, Iran has increasingly violated the agreements it made under the deal and expanded its nuclear program. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken backed the proposal from the EU, saying that the US is “prepared to move forward on the basis of what’s been agreed,” but it is unclear if Iran is prepared to do the same. Borrell described the proposal as “the best possible deal that (he), as facilitator of the negotiations, see as feasible,” noting that “after 15 months of intense, constructive negotiations and countless interactions with the JCPOA participants and the US, the space for additional significant compromises to reach an agreement has been exhausted.” “It is not a perfect agreement, but it addresses all essential elements and includes hard-won compromises by all sides,” Borrell wrote in a post Saturday. “Decisions need to be taken now to seize this unique opportunity to succeed, and to free up the great potential of a fully implemented deal. I see no other comprehensive or effective alternative within reach.” During a press availability at the United Nations on Monday, Blinken noted that “the EU has put forward a best proposal based on many, many months of discussions, negotiations, conversations.” “It’s very consistent with something that they put forward in March that we’ve we agreed to, that we would pursue it in March,” Blinken said. “But it remains to be seen whether Iran is willing and able to move forward.” “We continue to believe, as I said this morning, that that would be the best path forward – a return to compliance off both sides to the JCPOA, to make sure that we are putting Iran’s nuclear program back in a box and averting any kind of crisis,” he said.",Rob Malley;Enrique Mora;Donald Trump;Antony Blinken;Nasser Kanaani;Ali Bagheri Kani;Josep Borrell,Twitter;Twitter;Top European Union;Iran Foreign Ministry;United States;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,1374;NEGOTIATIONS,223;NEGOTIATIONS,2138;NEGOTIATIONS,2217;NEGOTIATIONS,2908;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,223;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2138;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2217;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2908;WB_840_JUSTICE,223;WB_840_JUSTICE,2138;WB_840_JUSTICE,2217;WB_840_JUSTICE,2908;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,223;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,2138;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,2217;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,2908;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,223;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,2138;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,2217;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,2908;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,223;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2138;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2217;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2908;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,223;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,2138;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,2217;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,2908;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,223;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2138;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2217;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2908;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,223;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,2138;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,2217;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,2908;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,223;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,2138;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,2217;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,2908;TAX_FNCACT_FACILITATOR,2118;TAX_FNCACT_ENVOY,536;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,1233;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,1853;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRIAN,334;TAX_FNCACT_NEGOTIATOR,1244;SEIZE,2563;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1292;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1508;MEDIA_SOCIAL,288;MEDIA_SOCIAL,863;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3380;LEADER,1667;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1667;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1667;TAX_FNCACT_DIPLOMAT,469;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,254;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,905;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1844;",Tehran;Iran;Austrian;United States;Vienna;Washington;Iranian;Doha,840

Balint, a former schoolteacher first elected to the state legislature in 2014, is widely viewed as the frontrunner heading into Tuesday’s election, with Gray her closest rival. What began as a crowded field has thinned over the last few months. Louis Meyers, a physician, is the only other candidate actively campaigning following Sianay Chase Clifford’s withdrawal in July. A former Welch staffer and Vermont assistant attorney general, Gray’s early momentum appears to have slowed over the summer as her rival solidified progressive support. Balint’s strength has been bolstered by endorsements from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the state’s popular independent progressive, and, importantly, state Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, who dropped out of the primary in May and immediately backed Balint, helping to consolidate support on the left. The contest for Vermont’s lone House seat was triggered by Leahy’s announcement last November that he would retire at the end of the term after nearly 50 years on the job. Welch quickly announced his candidacy to replace Leahy, which cleared the way for the rare open-seat race. Leahy has not formally endorsed Gray, though he has donated to her cause and said he voted for her. His wife, Marcelle Leahy, endorsed Gray, who also has the support of moderate former Vermont Govs. Howard Dean and Madeleine Kunin.  Welch, who won the seat in 2006 when it last came open, has largely steered clear of the primary except to praise the women on the ballot. He won reelection in 2020 with more than 67% of the vote.  Balint and Gray have raised similar amounts of cash over the course of the race, but Balint has benefited from significant outside spending – which Gray’s campaign has repeatedly criticized. The LGBTQ Victory Fund’s PAC has been the biggest player, backing Balint, who is gay, and investing about $1 million on her behalf. The Congressional Progressive Caucus’ campaign arm has also spent nearly $200,000 for Balint. Rich Clark, a professor at Castleton University and Vermont pollster, said that with so little separating the candidates on policy, branding has become a more influential element in the race.  “I don’t think this is an issues race,” Clark said, a factor that has added more weight to endorsements and the “progressive versus moderate impression” among voters. Though Gray and Balint are, indeed, closely aligned on almost every major issue, Balint has emerged as the progressive standard-bearer, winning support from Sanders and both senators from neighboring Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is also backing Balint, along with other leading national figures on the left.  “When it comes down to policy, there’s not a lot of space between them, but when it comes down to image, I think there is,” Clark said. “High turnout for us has been about 25% (in primary elections), so we’re not talking about a real representation of the Democratic Party in Vermont. It’ll be the most engaged and they’ll tend to be on the progressive side.” Balint has outflanked Gray on the left with her clear support for stripping qualified immunity from police, which protects officers from most private lawsuits. Gray has been noncommittal, suggesting in a recent debate that she might support such a move should it extend to a wider swath of public officials.  But even as they sought to carve out distinctions in their views on policing and drug policy, it was a remark by Balint in May, during a forum with members of the Vermont Progressive Party, that provided the debate’s sharpest exchange. Balint, at a gathering with VPP members this spring, said it would “be an absolute catastrophe if the candidate representing us on the left was Molly Gray,” whom she labeled a “corporatist Democrat.” During the debate, Gray jabbed Balint over “negative attacks” and said that while Balint subsequently backed off the comment, “There’s never been a personal apology.”   “You can take the opportunity tonight if you want,” Gray said. Balint did.  “If you took offense to that comment, I apologize,” she said. “If you found it hurtful, I apologize.”",Ed Markey;Molly Gray;Molly Gray;Pramila Jayapal;Elizabeth Warren;Louis Meyers;Madeleine Kunin;Howard Dean;Marcelle Leahy;Patrick Leahy;Kesha Ram Hinsdale;Becca Balint;Peter Welch;Bernie Sanders,Democratic Party;Castleton University;Cnn;Vermont Progressive Party;Victory Fund,"EDUCATION,612;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,64;ELECTION,327;ELECTION,724;",Washington;Vermont;Massachusetts,1000
374,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/biden-covid-loose-cough/,"President Joe Biden continues to test positive for Covid-19 and now has a bit of a “loose cough” as he experiences a rebound case of the virus, his doctor said Monday.  Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo that the President, who first tested positive for his rebound case on Saturday and has tested positive every day since, does not have a fever and that his lungs are “clear.” “His temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remain entirely normal,” O’Connor said, adding that the President is in “good spirits.” Biden, 79, is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19 due to his age, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says if older adults are fully vaccinated and boosted, it significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death. Biden is fully vaccinated and has received two booster shots.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre suggested on Monday in a briefing with reporters that the President had some lingering symptoms from his first Covid case and said, “As you know, some of you have had Covid … those symptoms that you have don’t go away right away, they kind of linger, those minimal symptoms kind of linger for some time. So you can expect that.” The President had mild symptoms during his first bout of Covid, including a runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough, according to his doctor.  O’Connor said in his memo on Saturday that the President had not experienced a “remergence of symptoms,” and then in his memos on Sunday and Monday said Biden “continues to feel well,” but did not say whether he was experiencing any symptoms.  Biden first tested positive on July 21 and proceeded to take a five-day course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. The CDC issued a health alert to doctors on May 24 advising that Covid-19 symptoms sometimes come back, and that may just be how the infection plays out in some people, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated or treated with medications like Paxlovid. The CDC said most cases of rebound involve mild disease and that there have been no reports of serious illness. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci also experienced a rebound case of  Covid-19. His symptoms got worse when they returned after treatment, and his doctors prescribed another course of Paxlovid.

370,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/lawrence-rudolph-guilty-safari-murder-cec,"An American dentist and big-game hunter was found guilty of murder in the shooting death of his wife on an African safari. Lawrence Rudolph, 67, killed his wife, Bianca Rudolph, with a shotgun and defrauded multiple  insurance companies, a federal jury found Monday. Rudolph cashed in more than $4.8 million in life insurance payments after her death almost six years ago. Rudolph has maintained his innocence and said he believes the gun fired accidentally. “I did not kill my wife. I could not murder my wife. I would not murder my wife,” Rudolph told jurors when he took the stand in his own defense at a federal trial in Denver last week.  The Phoenix couple shared a passion for big-game hunting, and had traveled to the southern African nation of Zambia in September 2016 so Bianca Rudolph could add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. Two weeks later, as Bianca Rudolph was packing for the couple’s return home, she suffered a fatal blast from the Browning shotgun in their hunting cabin at Kafue National Park. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot at dawn while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents said. He told investigators he found her bleeding on the floor.   But federal prosecutors at Rudolph’s trial in Denver, where the insurance companies are based, described it as a premeditated crime. Prosecutors argued Rudolph killed his wife of 30 years for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend, Lori Milliron. Defense attorney David Markus had argued that Larry Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In court documents, he noted that Rudolph owns a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million.  “We are obviously extremely disappointed. We believe in Larry and his children,” Markus and fellow defense attorneys Margot Moss and Lauren Doyle told CNN in a statement after Monday’s verdict. “There are lots of really strong appellate issues, which we will be pursuing after we have had a chance to regroup.” The jury also found Milliron, Rudolph’s girlfriend, guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder, obstruction of justice and two counts of perjury based on her testimony before a grand jury, according to the Department of Justice.  Milliron, who was tried alongside Rudolph, said the couple had been in an open relationship, according to court documents. Milliron and Rudolph lived together from 2017 until his arrest last year, her attorney, John Dill, told CNN. “We are disappointed in the jury’s verdict, but that is our system,” Dill said. “Lori Milliron is innocent and we will continue to fight to exonerate her.”  An embassy official expressed suspicion after the shooting, the FBI said  In court documents, investigators alleged Rudolph raised suspicions when he sought to quickly cremate his wife’s body in Zambia. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge.  Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. But forensic evidence showed Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint said. US Attorney Cole Finegan welcomed the jury’s ruling. “Bianca Rudolph deserved justice,” Finegan said in a statement. “We can only hope this verdict brings Bianca’s family some amount of peace.”   A friend of Bianca Rudolph’s asked the FBI to investigate  But federal investigators maintained the shooting was premeditated so that Rudolph “could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleged.   Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of Bianca Rudolph asked the FBI to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Larry Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death.  Milliron worked as a manager at Larry Rudolph’s dental practice near Pittsburgh and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, according to court documents. Milliron moved in with Rudolph three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, court documents said.

175,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/asia/china-taiwan-military-exercises-intl-hnk-ml/,"China fired multiple missiles toward waters near northeastern and southwestern Taiwan on Thursday, the island’s Defense Ministry said, as Beijing makes good on its promise that Taipei will pay a price for hosting US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement that multiple missiles had been fired into the sea off the eastern part of Taiwan. It said all the missiles hit their target accurately. “The entire live-fire training mission has been successfully completed and the relevant air and sea area control is now lifted,” China’s statement said. Earlier, the Eastern Theater Command said it had conducted long-range, live-fire training in the Taiwan Strait, state broadcaster CCTV reported, as part of planned military exercises around the island. Taiwan reported Chinese long-range rockets had fallen near its islands of Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, which are in the Taiwan Strait, but located closer to the mainland than the main island of Taiwan. It later said a total of 11 Dongfeng (DF) missiles were fired to the waters north, south and east of the island between 1:56 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time (from 1:56 a.m. ET to 4 a.m. ET) on Thursday.  The Chinese missiles flew over Taiwan Island for the first time, a Chinese military expert said on state television channel CCTV on Thursday, representing a major escalation of China’s military intimidation against Taiwan.  The conventional missiles flew over airspace covered by Taiwanese defense missiles, said Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor of strategy at the National Defense University in Beijing. “We hit the targets under the observation of US Aegis combat system, which means the Chinese military has solved the difficulties of hitting long-range targets on waters,” Meng said on CCTV. The Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in a statement late Thursday night that the trajectory of the missiles was above the atmosphere and therefore posed no risk to Taiwan. “Using the surveillance and reconnaissance systems, our military can accurately calculate the trajectory of the Dong Feng-series missiles fired by the Chinese Communist Party,” it said.  Because it was predicted that the missiles would land in the waters east of Taiwan, authorities did not trigger air raid alerts, it said.  Chinese state media said that exercises to simulate an air and sea “blockade” around Taiwan had started Wednesday, but offered little solid evidence to back up the claim. Later Thursday, images showed military helicopters flying past Pingtan island, one of Taiwan’s closest points to mainland China. The military posturing was a deliberate show of force after Pelosi left the island on Wednesday evening, bound for South Korea, one of the final stops on an Asia tour that ends in Japan this weekend. Within hours of her departure from Taipei on Wednesday, the island’s Defense Ministry said China sent more than 20 fighter jets across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, the midway point between the mainland and Taiwan that Beijing says it does not recognize but usually respects. In addition, the ministry said that 22 Chinese warplanes had entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Thursday, and that all of them crossed the strait median line.   The ministry also said it detected four drones – in three separate batches – flying over “restricted waters” around the Kinmen islands, a group of Taiwan-controlled outlying islands close to China, on Thursday night local time. Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement Thursday night that the military fired flares to warn the drones away – without specifying the origin or type of drone – and that it continues to monitor the situation and remains on high alertness. On Thursday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said its military was remaining in a “normal” but wary posture, and called the live-fire drills an “irrational act” that attempted to “change the status quo.” “We are closely monitoring enemy activities around the sea of Taiwan and that of outlying islands, and we will act appropriately,” the ministry said in a statement. Taiwan also accused China of “following North Korea’s example of arbitrary test-fire of missiles in waters close to other countries” in a statement issued by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.  The exercises have caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, with some international flights canceled and vessels urged to use alternative routes for several ports around the island. And they have heightened tensions beyond Taiwan’s waters. Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said Thursday that five missiles were believed to have landed within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). “This is a serious problem that concerns Japan’s security and the safety of its citizens. We strongly condemn it,” Kishi told reporters during a press conference. Kishi said this was the first time that Chinese ballistic missiles had landed within Japan’s EEZ and that a protest had been lodged with Beijing.  Exercises exerting pressure  Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who met with Pelosi during her visit, called China’s military drills “an irresponsible act,” adding that Taipei does not want to “provoke disputes” but will defend its sovereignty and national safety. In a speech on Thursday night, Tsai said the exercises have “undermined the status quo of the Taiwan Strait, intruded (on) our sovereignty, and heightened tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.” Well in advance of Pelosi’s near 24-hour visit to Taiwan, China had warned her presence was not welcome. The ruling Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governed island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it. China issued a map showing six zones around Taiwan that would be the site of drills in coming days. Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau said earlier Thursday that China had added a seventh military drill zone, but later retracted that statement, saying the earlier notice was wrong.   Chinese state media on Thursday outlined a broad range of objectives for the exercises, including strikes on land and sea targets. “The exercises (are) focused on key training sessions including joint blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control operation, and the joint combat capabilities of the troops got tested in the military operations,” said an announcement from the Xinhua news agency attributed to the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theater Command, which has responsibility for the areas near Taiwan.  Meanwhile, the Global Times tabloid said the drills involved some of China’s newest and most sophisticated weaponry, including J-20 stealth fighters and DF-17 hypersonic missiles, and that some missiles may be fired over the island – a move that would be extremely provocative. “The exercises are unprecedented as the PLA conventional missiles are expected to fly over the island of Taiwan for the first time,” the Global Times said, citing experts. “The PLA forces will enter areas within 12 nautical miles of the island and the so-called median line will cease to exist.”   Accounts from Taiwan of Chinese military movement included the fighter jets crossing the median line and a report from Taiwan’s government-run Central News Agency, citing government sources, that two of China’s most powerful warships – Type 55 destroyers – were sighted Tuesday off the central and southeastern coast of the island, the closest being within 37 miles (60 kilometers) of land. But there was little corroboration or firm evidence provided by China to back up the sort of claims posted in the Global Times. China’s state-run television offered video of fighter jets taking off, ships at sea and missiles on the move, but the dates of when that video was shot could not be verified. Some analysts were skeptical Beijing could pull off what they were threatening, such as a blockade of Taiwan. “The official announcement (of the blockade) refers to just a few days, which would make it hard to qualify it on practical terms to a blockade,” said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College in London. “Blockades are hard to execute and long to implement. This exercise is not that,” he said. Patalano said the biggest impact of the exercises would be psychological. “During the period of time in question, ships and aircraft will likely reroute to avoid the area, but this is one primary objective of the chosen locations: create disruption, discomfort, and fear of worse to come,” he said.  Rerouting planes and ships China’s retaliatory exercises have already caused disruption to flight and ship schedules in Taiwan, though the island is trying to lessen their impact.  Taiwan’s transportation minister said agreements had been reached with Japan and the Philippines to reroute 18 international flight routes departing from the island – affecting about 300 flights in total – to avoid the PLA’s live-fire drills. Korean Air told CNN on Thursday that it has canceled flights from Incheon to Taiwan scheduled for Friday and Saturday due to safety reasons while China conducts its military drills. Flights will resume on Sunday. China’s planned live-fire drills were also causing unease in Japan. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said the drills posed a threat to his country’s security. One of the six exercise areas set up by China was near Japan’s Yonaguni Island, part of Okinawa prefecture and only 68 miles (110 kilometers) off the coast of Taiwan. That same Chinese exercise zone is also close to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, a rocky uninhabited chain known as the Diaoyus in China, and over which Beijing claims sovereignty. “In particular, a training area has been set up in the waters near Japan, and if China were to conduct live ammunition exercises in such an area, it could affect the security of Japan and its people,” Matsuno said. Meanwhile, the United States military was silent on the Chinese exercises and did not provide any answers to CNN questions on Thursday. John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Thursday that China has “chosen to overreact” to Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and that the White House expects further provocative actions “in the coming days.”  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he hoped “Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” Speaking at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-US Ministerial Meeting in Cambodia, Blinken said the US remains committed to its “One China” policy.  On Wednesday, Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye warned that after “reunification” with Taiwan, there would be a “re-education” of the island. Besides keeping a close eye on Chinese military movements around the island, Taiwan also said it would strengthen security against cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. Taiwan’s cabinet spokesperson Lo Ping-cheng said in a Wednesday news conference that the government had enhanced security at key infrastructure points and increased the level of cybersecurity alertness across government offices. Taiwan is anticipating increased “cognitive warfare,” referring to disinformation campaigns used to sway public opinion, Lo said. This story has been updated with new information.

657,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/matthew-deperno-michigan-attorney-general/,"Michigan’s Democratic attorney general is calling for a special prosecutor to investigate her Donald Trump-backed challenger after finding evidence linking him to a potentially criminal plot to seize and tamper with voting machines used in the 2020 election, according to a letter obtained by CNN and documents released Monday by the attorney general’s office. For months, the Michigan State Police and the attorney general’s office have been investigating a series of voting machine breaches that took place in several counties around the state last year. According to the documents released Monday, that probe has led investigators to Kalamazoo-based lawyer Matthew DePerno, a Republican candidate running against incumbent Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. Trump has thrown his support behind DePerno, and he picked up an endorsement earlier this year from Michigan Republican Party activists, paving the way for him to officially become the GOP nominee for attorney general at the party convention later this month. He is one of several Trump-backed election deniers who are currently running to become the top law enforcement officer or the top election official in their states. Nessel is now asking for a special prosecutor to be appointed to avoid a potential conflict of interest. The investigation into voting machine breaches has unearthed facts that indicate DePerno and two other associates may have broken the law when they “orchestrated a coordinated plan to gain access to voting tabulators,” according to Nessel’s office. “When this investigation began there was not a conflict of interest. However, during the course of the investigation, facts were developed that DePerno was one of the prime instigators of the conspiracy,” Nessel’s office wrote in an August 5 petition for the Prosecuting Attorneys Coordinating Counsel to appoint a special prosecutor.  The DePerno campaign tweeted a statement late Sunday saying he has reviewed the petition for a special prosecutor and “denied the allegations presented.” The statement also says, “the claims presented by Nessel show a completely unwarranted and erroneous attack based on political prosecution.” The request from Nessel’s office alleges that DePerno was present in a hotel room in early 2021 when a group of individuals performed unauthorized “tests” on voting tabulators they had seized from multiple Michigan counties – suggesting investigators have evidence that directly links him to the potentially illegal breaches. “We have requested the appointment of a Special Prosecuting Attorney to review the case for the issuance of possible criminal charges against several of the individuals involved. We view the actions of these individuals to be very serious,” Nessel’s office wrote in a letter to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a fellow Democrat, summarizing the investigation’s findings. Reuters first reported DePerno’s alleged role in the voting machine breaches. The Detroit News first reported Nessel’s request for a special prosecutor.  In May, CNN reported that Michigan State Police had expanded its investigation into whether third parties gained unauthorized access to voting machine data after the 2020 election, and that the probe was looking into potential breaches in multiple counties. The investigation began in February after Benson’s office uncovered a breach of vote tabulator components in Roscommon County, in rural northern Michigan. The probe in Michigan reflects a growing number of incidents uncovered around the country where Trump supporters attempted to gain access to voting systems, as part of efforts to overturn or undermine the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. It also comes as several Trump-endorsed candidates have won the Republican nomination for roles that could position them to oversee future elections in key battleground states going forward. They succeeded in at least one instance in late November 2020, when a team of pro-Trump operatives traveled to Antrim County, Michigan, and conducted an audit of voting systems there, according to court documents released as part of a failed lawsuit filed by attorneys working on behalf of the former President at the time.  The lawsuit was led by DePerno and led to a since-debunked report issued by a team of analysts from a Texas-based company, Allied Security Operations Group, alleging irregularities in Dominion Voting Systems that was consistently cited as evidence in multiple failed legal challenges in Michigan and other swing states. (There is no evidence to support GOP claims of wrongdoing by Dominion.) Among the evidence investigators in Michigan say they have uncovered as part of their probe into voting machine breaches are digital IDs that DePerno had used as evidence in the failed suit.  “There must be consequences for those who broke the law to undermine our elections in order to advance their own political agendas,” Benson told CNN in a statement.  She added, “The Republican, Democratic and nonpartisan election clerks of this state do their jobs with professionalism and integrity, and we will continue to ensure they are equipped with a full understanding of the legal protections in place to block bad actors from pressuring them to gain access to secure election systems.”",Matthew Deperno;Jocelyn Benson;Dana Nessel,Michigan State Police;Michigan State Police;Security Operations Group;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Reuters;Michigan Republican Party,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,3783;RURAL,3467;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,2837;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,678;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,1828;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,4206;TAX_FNCACT_CLERKS,5079;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,3601;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1301;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1613;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1301;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1613;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,2802;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,911;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1154;LEADER,4248;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4248;DEMOCRACY,20;DEMOCRACY,5049;SECURITY_SERVICES,391;SECURITY_SERVICES,3096;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,391;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,3096;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENT,745;PROTEST,921;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,921;TAX_FNCACT_ACTIVISTS,921;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,4355;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1190;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,73;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,1255;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,1881;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,1998;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,3044;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,73;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1255;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1881;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1998;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3044;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,719;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,2158;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,4965;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1332;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1582;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1675;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2869;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,3142;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,3335;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1332;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1582;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1675;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2869;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,3142;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,3335;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1332;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1582;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1675;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2869;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,3142;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,3335;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1332;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1582;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1675;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2869;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,3142;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,3335;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,983;WB_2670_JOBS,5107;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,5107;WB_470_EDUCATION,5107;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,5107;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,5107;APPOINTMENT,1271;SEIZE,197;TRIAL,29;TRIAL,334;TRIAL,421;TRIAL,763;TRIAL,996;TRIAL,2567;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,29;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,334;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,421;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,763;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,996;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2567;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,183;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,2624;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,709;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,905;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3807;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5036;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,709;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,905;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3807;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5036;ELECTION,250;ELECTION,1086;ELECTION,1181;ELECTION,3240;ELECTION,3732;ELECTION,5072;ELECTION,5324;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1154;WB_840_JUSTICE,1154;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1154;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1154;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1154;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1154;LEGISLATION,1142;LEGISLATION,1448;LEGISLATION,4898;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1142;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1448;EPU_POLICY_LAW,4898;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,1162;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,1162;TAX_FNCACT_INSTIGATORS,1742;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2793;",Roscommon County;Michigan State Police;Michigan;Kalamazoo;Antrim County;Detroit,973
528,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/republicans-congress-reaction-trump-fbi-search-warrant/,"Top congressional Republicans are rushing to former President Donald Trump’s defense after the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as part of an investigation into the handling of potentially classified material. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Attorney General Merrick Garland to “preserve your documents and clear your calendar,” warning of an oversight probe “when” Republicans take back the chamber in the midterm elections. “The Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,” said McCarthy. House Republicans briefly discussed the FBI search during a conference call on Tuesday, multiple sources tell CNN. Top Republicans made clear that they want to get answers and a full accounting from the Justice Department. The call had been previously scheduled in order to discuss the Inflation Reduction Act that’s coming to the House floor Friday. But at the top of the call, McCarthy kicked things off then turned things over to Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.  They repeated their demands for accountability, but did not signal what their specific oversight plans will be if they win the majority. Trump is also set to meet Tuesday with about a dozen members of the House Republican Study Committee, led by Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, at his residence in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to a person familiar with their plans, providing a timely opportunity for the former president to rally members to his side after the FBI search. A July CNN poll found that a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters do not want Trump to be their party’s nominee in the 2024 presidential election. But the former president still is powerful within the party; Republican candidates across the country have sought his endorsement in their 2022 primaries, and on Saturday, Trump overwhelmingly won an unofficial straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Texas. Rallying around Trump, many Republicans, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, attacked Democrats instead after news of the FBI search, with some saying that Biden himself must be investigated.   “There must be an immediate investigation and accountability into Joe Biden and his Administration’s weaponizing this department against their political opponents – the likely 2024 Republican candidate for President of the United States,” said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, a member of House GOP leadership. Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, requested an “immediate briefing” from FBI Director Christopher Wray, saying the agency’s action was “unprecedented” and that he was “unaware of any actual or alleged national security threat” posed by materials in Trump’s possession. Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, a potential 2024 contender, criticized Biden, saying that he “has taken our republic into dangerous waters” and called for Garland to either resign or be impeached.  “At a minimum, Garland must resign or be impeached. The search warrant must be published. Christoper Wray must be removed. And the FBI reformed top to bottom,” Hawley tweeted.  Former Vice President Mike Pence called on Garland to provide a “full accounting” of the FBI search.   “I share the deep concern of millions of Americans over the unprecedented search of the personal residence of President Trump,” Pence tweeted. “Yesterday’s action undermines public confidence in our system of justice and Attorney General Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken, and he must do so immediately,” he said.  While many prominent Republicans were quick to criticize the Biden administration and defend Trump, others took a more muted approach as questions remained around the cause of the FBI’s search. At a news conference in Kentucky focused on flood damage, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on the FBI executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. “I’m here today to talk about the flood and the recovery from the flood,” he said.  Hours later, the Republican leader released a statement calling for Garland to “immediately” explain what happened. “The country deserves a thorough and immediate explanation of what led to the events of Monday,” McConnell said. “Attorney General Garland and the Department of Justice should already have provided answers to the American people and must do so immediately.” Democrats responded that no one is above the law. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on NBC’s Today show that she first learned of the FBI’s search when it “flashed” on her phone, and repeatedly said she only knows what is public. “We believe in the rule of the law,” Pelosi added. And Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House Oversight Committee investigating Trump’s handling of documents, called on the Justice Department to “fully investigate” the former president’s handling of information. “Presidents have a solemn duty to protect America’s national security, and allegations that former President Trump put our security at risk by mishandling classified information warrant the utmost scrutiny,” said the New York Democrat. “Although details of today’s actions at Mar-a-Lago are still emerging, it is clear that the Department of Justice must fully investigate President Trump’s potentially grave mishandling of classified information.” A number of Senate Republicans cried foul about the Justice Department taking action against Trump, a former and presumed future rival of President Joe Biden. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said, “President Trump is likely going to run again in 2024,” and noted the midterm elections are in less than 100 days away. “Launching such an investigation of a former President this close to an election is beyond problematic.” The FBI search also quickly became a talking point in the Florida gubernatorial race. Governor Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 Republican rival to Trump, tweeted, “The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents,” referring to the Biden administration.  Florida Rep. Charlie Crist, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, shot back, “Governor DeSantis’s knee-jerk partisan response to this law enforcement action proves yet again he is more interested in playing politics than seeking justice or the rule of law.” This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

194,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/tennessee-primary-5th-district/,"Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles will win the Republican nomination in Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District, CNN projects. The newly drawn district attracted a crowded field of candidates vying to represent part of the Nashville area. Ogles, an entrepreneur, will defeat state House Speaker Beth Harwell and retired Brig. Gen. Kurt Winstead.   Tennessee’s new congressional map split Davidson county, home to Nashville, into three separate districts, likely shifting the state’s delegation from seven Republicans and two Democrats to eight Republicans and one Democrat.  Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper, who currently represents the Nashville-anchored 5th District seat as it is currently drawn, cited the new map when he announced he wouldn’t be seeking another term. Ogles, whose campaign is backed by outside super political action committees including the USA Freedom Fund and Americans for Prosperity, received criticism over where his support comes from – though Winstead and Harwell have outraised the field, according to FEC filings. Ahead of the primary election, Harwell told a local outlet in a statement, “It’s clear if Andy Ogles wins, he will be controlled by the DC swamp.”   “He owes everything to them, and I don’t think that’s right for the people of middle Tennessee,” she said. For his part, while Ogles said that while, “of course you can’t coordinate, you can’t communicate,” his campaign made a strategic decision to encourage outside support. “We firewalled off some of our donors away from the campaign to go run positive ads… so there’s been radio and there’s been mailers, there’s been doors knocked that I have not been able to control because the campaign wasn’t doing it,” Ogles told Nashville area radio host Michael Delgiorno on SuperTalk 99.7 WTN. He said that strategy allowed him and his campaign to focus more on the “grassroots” effort in Tennessee. Still, the field was less crowded than it was earlier this year, after the Tennessee Republican Party voted to boot three candidates from its primary ballot for the district – including Trump-endorsed hopeful Morgan Ortagus. That decision came after state GOP officials agreed to review challenges to the three candidates that raised questions about their Republican bonafides, including whether they had voted in three of the last four Republican primaries, as required by the state party’s bylaws. State Sen. Heidi Campbell ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination. She has raised significantly less than the leading GOP candidates, per FEC reports.

586,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business/costco-kirkland-signature-trader-joes-store-brands/,"Kirkland Signature. Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular. They have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI. As prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper. But the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.  Retailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap. Many leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.   Although store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels. Other brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels. “Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.” But there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark\n            \n                (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco \n            \n                (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco \n            \n                (COST)executives have said.  Georgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel\n            \n                (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial. Eight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore Store labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century. Macy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands. Montgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.   Yet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.  In 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States. These private labels were the exception, however.  For most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup\n            \n                (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson\n            \n                (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products. Most customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage. Additionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.  The low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples. Shopper loyalty Retailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.  Private brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.  In the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not. “Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor. Today, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains. Stores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI. Costco\n            \n                (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco\n            \n                (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.  Costco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.  Retailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma\n            \n                (WSM) sued Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled. The US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website. Amazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site. Most stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong. “You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.” How to find out who makes store brands So how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands? Product recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.  Last year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.  J.M. Smucker\n            \n                (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s. Then there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods\n            \n                (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart\n            \n                (WMT).  James Walser, who led the launch of Target’s\n            \n                (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels. Some large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.   Perhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.",Richard Galanti;James Walser;Christopher Durham;Krishnakumar Davey,Giant Eagle;Walmart;Walmart;Walmart;Walmart;Walmart;Walmart;Sears;Sears;Sears;Safeway;Safeway;Costco;Costco;Costco;Costco;Costco;Costco;Costco;Costco;University Of North Carolina;United States;Velocity Institute;Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Co;Trader Joe;Trader Joe;Trader Joe;Kroger;Kroger;Us House Judiciary Committee,"TAX_FNCACT_GROCER,1142;TAX_FNCACT_GROCER,1266;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,753;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1620;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,753;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,1620;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,753;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,1620;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,753;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,1620;EDUCATION,1829;EDUCATION,5392;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,1829;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,5392;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,6606;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,6606;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_CAT,74;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_CAT,8235;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_CAT,8314;TAX_FNCACT_RETAILER,3180;TAX_FNCACT_RETAILER,5841;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,6428;WB_851_INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY_RIGHTS,6428;WB_1041_PATENTS,6428;WB_1039_PROPERTY_LAWS_AND_REGULATIONS,6428;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,6428;TRIAL,6303;TRIAL,6410;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVES,2199;TAX_FNCACT_TRADER,1070;TAX_FNCACT_TRADER,1194;TAX_FNCACT_TRADER,7899;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_WALSER,8362;MEDIA_MSM,3816;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODED,3790;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3790;TAX_ECON_PRICE,300;TAX_ECON_PRICE,4779;TAX_ECON_PRICE,5021;TAX_ECON_PRICE,5882;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATORS,6619;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1847;TAX_FNCACT_CRAFTSMAN,3360;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,1698;WB_1650_PUBLIC_EMPLOYMENT_SERVICES,1698;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,1698;WB_1652_PLACEMENT,1698;WB_698_TRADE,2679;LEADER,2643;LEADER,5683;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2643;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,5683;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2643;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5683;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,482;WB_2943_SWITCHES,482;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,482;WB_672_NETWORK_MANAGEMENT,482;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,482;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,375;WB_1358_GENERIC_DRUGS,375;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,375;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,375;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,1372;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,2328;TAX_FNCACT_CFO,6143;NEGOTIATIONS,4544;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,4323;",Georgia;New York;United States,1765
594,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/rudy-giuliani-georgia-grand-jury/,"Rudy Giuliani was ordered by an Atlanta-area judge Tuesday to appear in person on August 17 in front of the special purpose grand jury investigating whether former President Donald Trump and his allies violated the law in their efforts to flip the 2020 election results in Georgia.       Lawyers for Giuliani, who served as an attorney for Trump during the 2020 election, are seeking to delay his appearance – originally scheduled for Tuesday – saying he shouldn’t fly after he underwent heart stent surgery last month. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney proposed that Giuliani explore land-based travel options.     “John Madden drove all the way over the country in his big bus from stadium to stadium so one thing we need to explore is whether Mr. Giuliani could get here without jeopardizing his recovery and his health, on a train or on a bus or whatever it would be,” McBurney said during the hearing.     Attorney Bill Thomas, who is representing Giuliani, told CNN after the hearing they are going to “explore all the options” for Giuliani’s travel, and that they would plan to be “back here” on the 17th.   “If the court orders that he travel by Greyhound to Atlanta, we are going to do what the court orders him to do,” Thomas said during the hearing. It’s still not clear if Giuliani is a target in the grand jury investigation. The subject came up briefly at the hearing when Giuliani’s lawyer asked, but the judge said that the prosecutors didn’t need to immediately respond.     McBurney signed off on the subpoena in early July, saying that Giuliani was a “necessary and material witness” in the special grand jury’s investigation.     The Fulton County District Attorney’s office asked the judge to compel Giuliani to testify and said they would “provide alternate transportation including “bus or train” to ensure his appearance before the special grand jury, according to a court filing.     The District Attorney’s office declined offers from Giuliani to appear virtually or wait until he is medically cleared to fly, according to court filings. On Tuesday, the DA’s office said they had “no interest” in Giuliani appearing any other way than but in person.    Giuliani met with Georgia state legislators three times in December 2020 in the aftermath of the presidential election, twice in person and once remotely. During the meetings, Giuliani spread conspiracy theories about widespread irregularities and fraud in the state. Among the false claims, Giuliani accused two Atlanta election workers of smuggling fraudulent Biden ballots in suitcases.     Numerous state and federal officials have debunked Giuliani’s claims of fraud in Georgia, a state that Joe Biden won by nearly 12,000 votes.  Byung “Bjay” Pak, the former top federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Georgia, was among those who testified before the US House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection that Giuliani’s claims of election fraud in Fulton County had been investigated by federal authorities and found to be untrue.     Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has detailed the far-reaching scope of the investigation, saying that it includes potential “solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and any involvement in violence or threats related to the election’s administration.”   CNN’s Celeste Noraian and Preston Fore contributed to this report.",Byung Bjay Pak;John Madden;Donald Trump;Rudy Giuliani;Celeste Noraian;Joe Biden;Robert Mcburney,Cnn;Cnn,"ELECTION_FRAUD,2960;ELECTION_FRAUD,3243;DELAY,388;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,388;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1372;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1668;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,3176;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1372;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1668;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3176;WB_840_JUSTICE,1372;WB_840_JUSTICE,1668;WB_840_JUSTICE,3176;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1372;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1668;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,3176;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1372;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1668;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,3176;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1372;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1668;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,3176;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1372;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1668;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,3176;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2281;TAX_FNCACT_LEGISLATORS,2242;TAX_FNCACT_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY,1722;TAX_FNCACT_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY,1958;TAX_FNCACT_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY,3108;KILL,3313;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,65;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,578;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1457;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1745;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,1437;MEDICAL,514;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,3037;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,3037;GENERAL_HEALTH,852;TAX_FNCACT_FEDERAL_OFFICIALS,2630;SMUGGLING,2554;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,333;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,946;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1722;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1958;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3108;CORRUPTION,2443;CORRUPTION,2669;CORRUPTION,2960;CORRUPTION,3243;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,2443;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,2669;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,2960;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,3243;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,2443;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,2669;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,2960;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,3243;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3306;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,292;LEADER,179;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,179;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,179;TAKE_OFFICE,3371;TRIAL,140;TRIAL,1358;TRIAL,1654;TRIAL,1903;TREASON,2921;ELECTION,262;ELECTION,365;ELECTION,2310;ELECTION,2533;ELECTION,2954;ELECTION,3237;ELECTION,3435;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,2541;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2630;LEGISLATION,222;EPU_POLICY_LAW,222;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3401;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3401;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,3401;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTOR,2783;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2783;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,712;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,876;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1840;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,712;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,876;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,1840;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,1483;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1826;",Georgia;Atlanta;Fulton County,685
422,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business-food/woke-food-nightcap/,"So, Cracker Barrel … It’s a restaurant you traditionally go to after church to eat an unholy amount of biscuits and gravy while your grandma stocks up country-themed tchotchkes and gingham-printed novelty dish towels embroidered with nonsense like “happiness is homemade.”  At least that’s my memory of it.   Point is, it’s a wholesome place. But leave it to Facebook commenters to turn it into a battleground of the Great American Culture Wars. Here’s the deal: Cracker Barrel added Impossible sausage to its menus. Perhaps because they realized (20 years too late, in my case) that they weren’t really providing for the growing number of vegetarians and vegans in America who, like, occasionally are also hungry. But of the more ravenous carnivores out there didn’t like the addition of “fake” meat, and they didn’t hold back in their Facebook comments replying to Cracker Barrel’s post announcing the update. A sampling: “I just lost respect for a once great Tennessee company.”  “Stop with the plant based ‘meat’ crap.”  “Bad choice.” Several commenters decried the menu addition as “woke,” an anti-racist term that has been co-opted into a pejorative against progressive actions and beliefs.  To be clear, Cracker Barrel isn’t replacing its meat sausages with veggie alternatives. It’s not mandatory or anything, as hundreds of other commenters noted in their retorts… “It’s amazing the snowflakes here getting triggered by a meat alternative showing up on a menu. Y’all can still order regular meat, you know that right?”  Ironically, an Impossible sausage is supposed to look and taste just like a real meat sausage — it’s designed to pass for meat, not make an obvious statement against it. A Cracker Barrel customer who is appalled by the new menu item likely wouldn’t realize if his neighbor got an Impossible sausage instead of a regular one. He might not even realize if the imposter product appeared on his own plate.   Cracker Barrel, naturally, stayed neutral, replying that, “The menu is always changing, but our love for our customers never will.”  BOTTOM LINE: It’s a silly story, of course. No one’s really going to boycott the restaurant over this. But it’s a fun/slightly horrifying glimpse at the way social media both magnifies and deepens cultural divisions on issues as minor as what someone chooses to eat for breakfast. Over-the-top social media reactions to food news are common — so common that it’s spawned conspiracy theories that some changes are just stunts. After one well-known ice cream maker confirmed the death of its famous chocolate taco, some wondered whether the move was just a hoax designed to create hype around the product. Choco Taco truthers are predicting a well-timed resurrection, after people realize just how much they love and miss the sweet treat. (Choco Taco’s maker Klondike said this week that the reaction has made it reconsider its plans). Companies are definitely paying attention to what customers are saying about their products online. That’s why we had a Taco Bell Hotel, for a brief, strange, shining moment in time. Effusive online ribbing can be a good thing for big restaurant chains and food makers. But it can also be toxic, like when hateful comments appeared online for mom-and-pop restaurants over their Covid-19 vaccination policies. At the end of the day, Cracker Barrel’s move is a shrewd business decision. The global plant-based meat market is expected to be valued at around $25 billion by 2030 – there’s clearly demand for it. And Cracker Barrel isn’t exactly breaking new ground here: Burger King has the Impossible Whopper; McDonald’s is working on its own version with Beyond Meat; even meat purveyor Tyson has its own chicken-less chicken products.  And what red-blooded American would have beef with a restaurant making such a purely capitalist decision? – CNN Business’ Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this analysis",,Facebook;Facebook;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Cracker Barrel;Burger King;Mcdonald;Taco Bell Hotel,"HEALTH_VACCINATION,3416;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,3416;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2361;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2496;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2361;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2496;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2361;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2496;USPEC_POLICY1,3425;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1099;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2673;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,945;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,1167;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,1395;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,1570;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,1638;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,1748;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,1793;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,3532;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,3774;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,3786;INFO_HOAX,2751;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2673;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,3404;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2641;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2405;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,441;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3872;MEDIA_SOCIAL,377;MEDIA_SOCIAL,988;ECON_BOYCOTT,2275;ECON_STOCKMARKET,168;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3493;ARMEDCONFLICT,454;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,454;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,454;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,454;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,98;TAX_FNCACT_KING,3689;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2361;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2496;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2361;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2496;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2361;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2496;",America;Tennessee;American;New York,825
487,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/uvalde-school-district-interim-police-chief-search,"The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District is searching for an interim police chief as Chief Pete Arredondo is on unpaid leave while he awaits a termination hearing, school board Superintendent Hal Harrell said Monday. “We continue to search and talk to different organizations about an interim police chief or an interim team,” Harrell said in a public meeting Monday evening. “There have been four officers who have been recommended for hire. They are all from out of town and they look like very promising candidates, lots of years of experience. So we will continue on that progress as well.” The board’s search was previously reported by the online newspaper Uvalde Hesperian, citing comments given by school board President Luis Fernandez at a Rotary Club meeting last week.  Arredondo was placed on unpaid leave following his highly criticized handling of the massacre at Robb Elementary School in May, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials have said Arredondo was the on-scene commander during the shooting, but the chief has disputed this, saying he did not believe he was in charge. The Uvalde superintendent recommended Arredondo be fired in the wake of the tragedy and amid growing anger from residents and families who demanded the chief be terminated from the position. The school board has postponed Arredondo’s termination hearing twice because of requests from his attorney involving his right to due process. Most recently, the board pushed off the meeting due to a “scheduling conflict” which prevented the hearing from being held on August 4, the district said. A new hearing date was not set at the time. Harrell also provided updates on safety measures being implemented for the new school year, including at least 500 cameras to be purchased for the district, designated points of entry for parents and visitors and the continued installation of fences, although it’s not clear if the fences will be completed by the first day of school. The school district recently completed a wifi audit to see what needs to be strengthened and is also in the process of getting an estimate for security film and glass, Harrell said. He said the school district has spent approximately $4.5 million on security and community support this summer, which was from a variety of funding resources.  The Texas Department of Public Safety has officially agreed to have 33 officers assigned to Uvalde school campuses and will remain there throughout the school year, Harrell said. He added that each officer will be assigned to a designated campus. “We know going back to school will be especially challenging for many in Uvalde,” DPS Director Steven McCraw said in a release about the additional officers. “The Texas Department of Public Safety is committed to working with the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District to ensure each child, parent, and teacher feels safe and protected during this difficult time. There is no task more important than this.” Harrell also announced that there will be an option to attend school virtually in the upcoming year. Uvalde parent, Adam Martinez, said he will likely keep his two children in virtual learning, saying that even though some of the security measures are reassuring, his son said that an increased number of officers doesn’t make him feel safer because he believes officers didn’t help during the massacre.  “As of right now, we’ll just continue virtual and see if somehow we can change the perception of the school officers or the police officers in general because right now, it seems like the children don’t have any confidence. They are going to school scared,” Martinez told CNN.  Martinez said he is one of the parents helping to file grievances against the school board, Harrell and other school staff. So far, they’ve filed at least six complaints and want Harrell removed, he said.  Fernandez confirmed the school district has zeroed in on a property to replace Robb Elementary, which the district has said students will not return to, according to the Uvalde Hesperian report. Additionally, Fernandez said the district will approach fire drills differently, using the intercom system instead of sirens, the paper reported. CNN has reached out to the school district and the Texas Department of Public Safety for confirmation and comment, and has not immediately heard back. Following the massacre, a report from a Texas House Investigative Committee identified widespread failures across responding law enforcement agencies during the shooting. The report also concluded Arredondo failed to assume his responsibility as the on-scene commander during the incident. Responding officers arrived at the school within minutes of the shooter entering the building on May 24, but it took more than an hour for law enforcement to enter the adjoining classrooms and kill the gunman, according to a timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). “At Robb Elementary, law enforcement responders failed to adhere to their active shooter training, and they failed to prioritize saving the lives of innocent victims over their own safety,” the report said, adding, “The void of leadership could have contributed to the loss of life as injured victims waited over an hour for help, and the attacker continued to sporadically fire his weapon.” Arredondo has resisted officials’ statements identifying him as the leading officer, saying he “was responding as a police officer” and did not consider himself to be in charge. However, video footage from body-worn cameras and security cameras shows officers on the scene deferring to Arredondo when they are unsure of their role during the shooting and also shows Arredondo giving orders and coordinating personnel, according to a CNN analysis of the footage. On Wednesday, a Travis County judge denied state Sen. Roland Gutierrez’s request to force the DPS to release more records related to the shooting, saying it wasn’t properly submitted. Gutierrez told CNN he intends to appeal the ruling.   CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe, Rebekah Riess and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.

445,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/stacey-abrams-abortion-views-cnntv/,"Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams said Sunday that she was “anti-abortion” until she went to college and met a friend who gave her a new perspective on the contentious issue. “I’ve thought about my faith a great deal. In fact, I was anti-abortion until I went to college. And there I met a friend who has my shared faith values, but we started having conversations about what reproductive care and abortion care really is. And when I talk about that, it was an experience that I had because she was able to give me a different perspective,” Abrams told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” when asked how her Christian faith factors into her thinking on the issue.  “And over the course of the next few years, I really started thinking about what role should the legislature play, what role should government play?” she continued. “This is health care. This is about a woman’s right to control her body. … And that, for me as a matter of faith, means that I don’t impose those values systems on others. More importantly, I protect her rights, I protect her humanity and that should be my responsibility.”   Abrams is currently in her second campaign for governor of Georgia against GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who narrowly defeated her in 2018. Abortion rights has become a key issue in Georgia this time after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, a decision that helped clear the way for a restrictive abortion ban in the state to take effect.   The ban, signed by Kemp 2019, prohibits abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy – when many women don’t yet know they’re pregnant. The law was later blocked by a federal district judge as unconstitutional. However, after Roe was overturned, a federal appeals court allowed it to take effect. Asked by Bash how she would fight for abortion rights with a Republican-controlled state legislature, Abrams said such a scenario wouldn’t be the first time she’s had to interact with people of varying political ideologies.   “I served for 11 years in the legislature, seven years as Democratic leader, as the minority leader, and I was extraordinarily successful,” she said.   “I understand how to negotiate and how to navigate, but what I also understand is that the majority of Georgians do not like this law – it is an extreme ban, it is dangerous, and it affects women across the spectrum,” she added.    “Electing me as governor is going to be a sea change, and it is going to be a strong signal to the remaining legislators that they’ve got to do right by the women of Georgia,” Abrams said.   Abrams has previously called for federal legislation restoring Roe v. Wade, telling CNN in June that there’s a need for a “legislative solution that restores the constitutional protection to women, regardless of the state they live in.” Separately, Abrams was asked Sunday if she would support a second term for President Joe Biden. “If he chooses to run again, I am there to support him,” Abrams told Bash.

All three men already are serving life sentences for their convictions in state court on a series of charges related to the killing of the 25-year-old Black man, including felony murder.  They will be remanded to state custody to begin their sentences, the judge ruled. Their attorneys had argued they should serve their terms in federal prison.  “I’m very relived, I’m glad, I’m thankful,” Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, said after court.  “I want to say thank you to each and every one of you who stood with us through this long process.” During their victim impact statements, Cooper-Jones and other members of the family asked the judge to give the defendants the maximum possible sentence under federal guidelines.  “Your honor,” Cooper-Jones said, “I feel every shot that was fired every day.” Travis McMichael, his father and Bryan were found guilty of the federal charges in February, with the jury accepting prosecutors’ argument the defendants acted out of racial animus toward Arbery.  “The Justice Department’s prosecution of this case and the court’s sentences today make clear that hate crimes have no place in our country, and that the Department will be unrelenting in our efforts to hold accountable those who perpetrate them,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said. “Protecting civil rights and combating white supremacist violence was a founding purpose of the Justice Department, and one that we will continue to pursue with the urgency it demands.” Travis McMichael, who fatally shot Arbery, was also found guilty of using and carrying a Remington shotgun while his father, Gregory McMichael was found guilty of using and carrying a .357 Magnum revolver.   Travis McMichael and Gregory McMichael were also sentenced Monday to 20 years on the attempted kidnapping charges, to be served concurrently with their state sentences, Godbey Wood ruled Monday.  Travis McMichael also received an additional 10 years for the weapons charge to be served consecutively, while Gregory McMichael received an additional seven years on the weapons charge, which will also be served consecutively. The judge ruled both McMichaels did not have the funds to pay a fine. The judge noted that Bryan, who recorded the shooting and notified police of the video, should be distinguished from the McMichaels. Bryan was not armed while the McMichaels were. “To give you a life sentence would be to not distinguish you at all from the McMichaels,” she said, adding that Bryan still deserved a long sentence. She noted he would be 90 when his federal sentence ends. The sentencing of both McMichaels were preceded by emotional testimony from Arbery’s family, which told the court about how his killing had impacted them and changed their family.  They also condemned the actions of both men, with Cooper-Jones testifying to her confusion when she learned Gregory McMichael was with Travis he killed Arbery. At first, she said, she questioned whether that could be true. “I struggled to come to the realization that a father would actually accompany his son to take a life,” she said. “I didn’t want to believe that, because me as a mother, I could never accompany my son to do any type of crime.” Before Gregory McMichael was sentenced, he acknowledged Arbery’s family, who were in court, saying the “loss that you’ve endured is beyond description. There’s no words for it.”  “I’m sure that my words mean little to you, but I wanted to assure you I never wanted any of this to happen. There was no malice in my heart or my son’s heart that day,” he said. Gregory McMichael also apologized to his wife and his son, saying, “I should have never put him in that situation.”  “Finally, I pray that God’s peace will come to the Arbery family and this community,” Gregory McMichael said. Cooper-Jones told CNN’s Sara Sidner that while she accepted the apology, “I did not forgive him for what he did.” She said she thought he had a lot to think about while he’s been in jail for the past two-plus years. “He’s come to terms with he made a very bad decision, and he wanted to say he was sorry,” she told CNN. “So I did accept it, but as far as forgiving, I haven’t forgave him.” Bryan later issued a similar apology, but Arbery’s father, Marcus Arbery Sr., dismissed Bryan’s words. “When this first happened, he should have shown some kind of remorse then,” Arbery said.  “When you get caught up and it’s looking bad for you, that’s when you’re trying to apologize. That’s a bad time to apologize. He should have did that day one.”  Attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Arbery family, said he hopes it is a “turning point in the civil rights movement.” “This sentence sends a message that vigilantes cannot hunt down and kill an innocent Black man, putting themselves in the roles of police, judge and executioner, without paying a high price,” he said in a statement.  Judge denies McMichaels’ requests to remain in federal custody Arbery’s killing, months before the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, was in some ways a harbinger of the nationwide protests that erupted that summer as demonstrators decried how people of color sometimes are treated by law enforcement. Travis McMichael’s attorney Amy Lee Copeland argued Monday for her client to remain in federal custody and to serve out his prison term with the Federal Bureau of Prisons rather than the Georgia Department of Corrections.  Travis McMichael fears for his life in a state prison, Copeland said, telling the court his client had received “hundreds” of threats. Forcing him to serve the time in a Georgia state prison would essentially amount to a “backdoor death penalty” that could leave McMichael vulnerable to “vigilante justice,” she argued, acknowledging the “rich irony.”  Gregory McMichael’s attorney made a similar request, but argued the 66-year-old should be kept in federal custody for his health.  Prosecutors opposed both requests. In cases in which a defendant faces charges in separate jurisdictions, they argued, the one that issues its sentence first takes precedence. The judge agreed and denied the requests, telling Travis McMichael she had “neither the authority nor the inclination” to override the rules.  To make their case, federal prosecutors focused on how each defendant had spoken about Black people in public and in private, using inflammatory, derogatory and racist language.  Prosecutors and Arbery’s family had said he was out for a jog – a common pastime for the former high school football player – on February 23, 2020, when the defendants chased and killed him in their neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia.  Defense attorneys argued the McMichaels pursued Arbery in a pickup through neighborhood streets to stop him for police, believing he matched the description of someone captured in footage recorded at a home under construction. Prosecutors acknowledged Arbery had entered the home in the past, but he never took anything. The defense also argued Travis McMichael shot Arbery in self-defense as they wrestled over McMichael’s shotgun. Bryan joined the pursuit in his own truck after seeing the McMichaels follow Arbery in their pickup as he ran.  Two prosecutors initially instructed Glynn County police not to make arrests, and the defendants weren’t arrested for more than two months – and only after Bryan’s video of the killing surfaced, sparking the nationwide outcry.

580,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/cincinnati-downtown-shooting-sunday/,"Authorities are searching for at least two gunmen after nine people were injured in a shooting in downtown Cincinnati early Sunday, police said. The shooting in the city’s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood occurred shortly before 2 a.m., when more than a dozen shots were fired into a large crowd after two separate groups were involved in a “physical altercation,” Assistant Police Chief Michael John of the Cincinnati Police Department said at a news conference Sunday. Nine gunshot victims – eight men and one woman – were taken to a nearby hospital with minor injuries, John said. The victims’ ages range from 23 to 47. One Cincinnati police officer identified as Joe Shook was on scene at the time and shot at one suspect, John said, but it’s unclear whether that suspected gunman was hit. More shots were fired after the first shooter fled, he said, so police believe at least two gunmen are on the run.  “There is no question that the actions of Officer Joe Shook and his partner saved lives,” John said. Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval called the shooting “an absolute tragedy.”  “What took place last night is completely and totally unacceptable,” Pureval said. “The gun violence we are seeing in our communities cannot and will not persist, and we will continue to work hard to prevent gun violence in the future.” Cincinnati council member Scotty Johnson called on any witnesses to come forward. “If you see something, say something,” he said. “It is not snitching, it’s a matter of everybody in Cincinnati being safe and enjoying our great city.” “We want everybody to come downtown and have a good time, but personal accountability has to trump these ridiculous outlandish beefs that are going on in our city,” Johnson added.

595,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/violent-rhetoric-pro-trump-internet-fbi-search/,"“Lock and load,” was one of the top comments on an online forum dedicated to former President Donald Trump on Monday night, soon after it emerged his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort had been searched by the FBI. Other posts were more explicit, “I’m just going to say it. [Attorney General Merrick] Garland needs to be assassinated. Simple as that.” Another user posted, “kill all feds.”  Users also encouraged others to post the address of the magistrate judge they believe signed off on the search warrant. “I see a rope around his neck,” a comment under a picture of the judge read. On the same forum, researchers previously found talk of violence and discussion on how to attack police officers in the weeks leading up to the January 6, 2021, attack. Amid the users on the forum Monday night was a convicted US Capitol rioter. One reply to the top-rated “lock and load” post came from an account with the username bananaguard62 and asked “Are we not in a cold civil war at this point?” By combing through bananaguard62’s posts, Advance Democracy, a non-partisan, non-profit organization that conducts public-interest investigations, identified Tyler Welsh Slaeker as running the account. Slaeker was charged by the Justice Department last summer in connection with the January 6 attack. Slaeker’s in-laws tipped off the FBI about his presence at the Capitol, according to court filings, making him one of the many January 6 rioters who were turned in by family members.  He was initially charged with four nonviolent misdemeanors, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of entering a restricted building. His sentencing is scheduled for November. NBC News was first to report Advance Democracy’s findings on Slaeker. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It can be difficult to distinguish between empty and serious threats of violence online, but it cannot be ignored, said Daniel J. Jones, a former US Senate investigator who led the investigation into the CIA’s use of torture and now runs Advance Democracy, a non-partisan, non-profit organization that conducts public-interest investigations. “We are seeing conspiratorial rhetoric from elected officials, political leaders, and political entertainers that is fueling calls for real-world violence,” Jones said. “The conspiratorial and divisive rhetoric – from elected officials and others who should know better – is continuing to undermine our institutions and democracy at an alarming rate.” A congressional security official told CNN shortly after news of the search warrant broke Monday night, US Capitol Police began discussions about monitoring and planning for potential violent rhetoric.  Of particular concern is the possibility violence could be directed at members of Congress or other federal law enforcement, the security official said. The Capitol Police declined to comment on security plans. One post CNN found called for violence against FBI agents. The FBI declined to comment on the post or wider security concerns due to violent rhetoric. After the January 6 attack, alternative social media platforms became more popular among Trump supporters after companies like Facebook and Twitter banned Trump and some other prominent figures who spread election conspiracy theories. Those platforms, like Trump’s own Truth Social site, tout themselves as bastions of free speech, with looser rules and moderation. But that can result in the proliferation of violent rhetoric. CNN reported in June how threats against members of the January 6 House select committee circulated on those platforms. But talk of violence isn’t exclusive to the more fringe platforms.  There was a surge in tweets Monday mentioning “civil war” – at some points more than one tweet a second, according to a CNN review of data from Dataminr, a service that tracks Twitter activity. While some mentions of “civil war” came from Trump critics expressing fear what his supporters might do – one researcher posted multiple screenshots of Twitter accounts outright calling for civil war. Jones, whose group Advance Democracy has been tracking online threats since the FBI raid on Monday, said political leaders posting on their main social media accounts are stoking more violent rhetoric. “The attack on the Capitol on January 6th showed that we can’t ignore calls for political violence online – no matter how fringe the theories are behind those calls for violence,” Jones said. Magistrate judge’s bio removed from court website The biography of a federal magistrate judge in Florida, along with their contact information and office address, were removed from the court’s website amid the right-wing backlash to the FBI search. The magistrate judge has been identified by some media outlets as the judge who approved the FBI warrant. CNN has not independently confirmed that this is the judge in question and is not naming him at this time.  Records reviewed by CNN show the webpage with the judge’s information was removed from the official website for the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida sometime between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning. Reached for comment Tuesday, officials from the court didn’t say why the judge’s webpage was removed. CNN has requested comment from the FBI, the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department and the US Marshals Service. On Tuesday, on pro-Trump social media sites, there were calls for the publication of the judge’s home address, according to Ben Decker, the CEO of Memetica, a threat analysis company. Decker has seen a “massive surge” in threats targeting the judge since Monday, including, he told CNN, on message boards “that played a notable role in the lead-up to January 6.” In the federal court system, magistrate judges often handle procedural matters before the cases are assigned to a district judge, which is a much more prominent position and requires a presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. Magistrate judges differ from the US district judges who are appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate. Magistrate judges handle tasks like authorizing search warrants and conducting the preliminary proceedings in a criminal case, though they don’t have all the powers as a district judge.

67,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/election-skepticism-hyper-local/,"For several hours on a recent Thursday afternoon, a former college professor and his wife unspooled a string of alleged election “vulnerabilities” for officials in a rural New Mexico county to consider: “Digital manipulation” of the voter rolls. Voting machines that were not properly certified. “Ink anomalies” on ballots.  “Conspiracy to violate the election code imputes liability to you,” David Clements told the three members of the Otero County Commission, before adding, “Unless you do something about it.”   Four days later, they did – refusing to certify the June 7 primary results and setting off a high-profile confrontation between the all-Republican commission and New Mexico’s Democratic Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver before two commissioners relented in the face of a state Supreme Court order.  The showdown offers an illustration of how election skepticism has gone hyper-local in the 20 months since the 2020 presidential election and former President Donald Trump’s first efforts to promote the false claim that widespread fraud contributed to his defeat.   And as adherents of election skepticism have pushed their theories into more obscure corners of American democracy, state election officials are now scrambling to address the new challenges. They warn that these isolated pockets of resistance to carrying out normally ceremonial election functions, such as certifying results, could lead to chaos in future elections if they spread.  “It’s in the weeds that we are seeing this destabilization,” said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat. “It’s one of the many indications that the democracy is at code red.”  Public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol have laid bare the extraordinary efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the last presidential election – from moves to derail the vote-certification process in key states to the former President’s unsuccessful quest to have the Department of Homeland Security or other federal agencies seize voting machines.  If even a few counties balk at certifying results, Griswold said, it could establish “the groundwork so that the next time a president is talking to DHS to try and seize voting equipment, people might think, ‘Maybe, there’s a basis because folks in this random county are saying something is wrong with their election.’”  State officials, election experts and top figures in the federal government, including then-Attorney General William Barr, all have said there was no evidence of widespread fraud that would have overturned President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory.  New laws, contingency planning  Colorado lawmakers – at Griswold’s urging – recently passed a sweeping new law that aims to guard against insider threats to election operations. Among other things, it gives Griswold – or her designee – the power to certify election results should a local canvassing board refuse to sign off without a legitimate reason.  In New Mexico, state officials scrambled to develop an ad hoc plan that included asking the state’s high court to designate an alternate canvassing board to certify the Otero results had the county commissioners defied the court order, said Alex Curtas, a spokesman for Oliver.   Curtas said election officials also are planning to ask the Democratic-controlled legislature to add language to state law, clarifying “what these county canvass boards are there to do” when lawmakers convene next year.  And in Nevada, the secretary of state’s office is developing new regulations for hand-counting ballots after two rural counties in the state indicated they plan to move away from ballot-tabulating machines, citing distrust of voting equipment.   Cross-country crusade  Clements, a former prosecutor who has said he was fired from his teaching job at the University of New Mexico in 2021 for not complying with Covid-19 mandates, has crisscrossed the country with his claims, promoting his appearances from California to North Carolina to the more than 111,000 people who subscribe to his Telegram channel.   He and his wife, Erin Clements, also are overseeing an election audit in Otero County, authorized by the county commission. Their work is unpaid, according to Commissioner Couy Griffin, who said he brought the couple to the commission’s attention following an overture from Erin Clements.   A crowd-funding site that says it was created to support Clements over his firing by the University of the New Mexico shows it has raised more than $304,000 to date.  When contacted, David Clements called CNN a “propaganda network” and declined to answer questions, including several written questions sent Monday, unless he could record the exchange with a reporter and post it on social media. In a video posted earlier this year on Telegram, Clements discussed the benefits of the county-level approach with Jim Marchant – who is now the Republican nominee for Nevada secretary of state.  “I articulated what we call the county commission strategy some time ago because we kept running into these bottlenecks, where you have to get an entire legislature to approve,” Clements said.  Marchant, who has said he would not have certified Biden’s 2020 victory in Nevada, this year successfully lobbied county commissioners in Nye County, Nevada – a rural county north of Las Vegas – to vote to end the use of ballot tabulators and revert to hand-counting, over the objection of the county’s longtime Clerk Sandra “Sam” Merlino.  Merlino has said she has opted to retire early because of the dispute. Her last day is Friday.  “Just go talk to your county commissioners and let them know the vulnerabilities of these machines,” Marchant said to Clements.   In New Mexico, meanwhile, the Otero commissioners have adopted a similar stance, passing resolutions to discontinue the use of voting machines and ballot drop boxes – although those actions were largely symbolic. State law, for instance, requires at least two drop boxes per county.  Griffin, a co-founder of Cowboys for Trump, has been a central figure in his county’s campaign to challenge New Mexico’s election procedures. He was the sole commissioner who voted to defy court order to certify the primary results.   Griffin, a former rodeo cowboy at Disneyland Paris who now works as a stone mason, was convicted earlier this year of a misdemeanor charge of trespassing on the US Capitol grounds during the January 6 assault on the building. (He was sentenced in June to 14 days with time served, fined $3,000 and given one year of supervised release with the requirement that he complete 60 hours of community service.)  In an interview with CNN, Griffin said he wanted to leverage the county’s power over certification to demand more transparency of voting systems, including having a “forensics expert” of his choosing inspect Dominion Voting System machines.  “I’m not going as far as saying that China stole our elections,” he said, “but whenever you are dealing with technology and computers in a world that’s pretty much run by hackers, that’s of concern.”  Griffin said he’s encouraging similar action in other counties, despite his setback at home. “That’s the power we have on the local level,” he said.   Dominion Voting Systems has filed multiple lawsuits against people they say have spread unfounded conspiracy theories about the vulnerabilities of their voting machines.   In an interview with CNN, Kay Stimson, vice president of government affairs for Dominion Voting Systems, called the actions by counties like Otero an example of “just how damaging the lies have been to our company and our democracy.”  ‘I’m being attacked’  The saga in Otero County also has taken its toll on the elected clerk, Robyn Holmes, who said she’s exasperated by the relentless hunt for fraud in elections that she says have run smoothly.   (Biden won New Mexico in 2020, but Trump took Otero County by more than 25 percentage points.)  “I feel like I’m being attacked, particularly by Commissioner Griffin,” said Holmes, a Republican who has worked on elections in Otero for nearly 15 years. “In all the years that I’ve been clerk, I’ve never had a commission doubt anything about our elections.”  Holmes is term limited and will leave office at the end of 2024.   “I just wish my term was up at the end of this year,” she added. “This has been pretty frustrating, this last year.”  Griffin’s term will end this year, and he’s not running for reelection.   (He survived a recall effort in 2021 and now is trying to fend off a lawsuit by a liberal-leaning watchdog group that argues that he should be removed from office and prohibited from running in the future under a constitutional ban against insurrectionists holding office.)  For his part, Griffin said he’s unlikely to ever seek elective office again. But he said he’s hoping for a Trump appointment to a federal job – possibly in forest management – should the former President run again in 2024 and win.

444,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/biden-russia-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-cnntv/,"A bipartisan pair of senators has called on the Biden administration to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in response to its invasion of Ukraine, saying they would push Congress to pass a bill issuing the designation “whether or not” it had President Joe Biden’s support. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that the designation should be made either by the President or Congress, with both of them saying Biden must intensify pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and continue aiding Ukraine amid the ongoing invasion. “I hope the President will decide to adopt this stance voluntarily and he hasn’t taken it off the table on the state-sponsored terrorism,” said Blumenthal, who represents Connecticut.  Graham, of South Carolina, said he wants the Biden administration to engage with Congress in designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism but said Congress is “willing” to advance legislation calling for the designation regardless.    “I’d like to work with (the Biden administration). But whether or not we have to do legislation to make it happen – we’re willing to do. I am urging the administration to act now,” Graham said. The two senators traveled together in June to Ukraine, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and called on Biden to send more humanitarian aid to the county and issue stronger sanctions in addition to designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. The US State Department is responsible for designating nations as state sponsors of terrorism. The department defines the designation as a country that has “repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.” There are only four countries that are currently labeled state sponsors of terrorism by the US: North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Syria. In July, the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the State Department to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. And in April, a senior administration official said department officials were looking at the possibility of labeling Russia a state sponsor of terrorism.  Both senators on Sunday praised House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for making a controversial visit to Taiwan last week and connected American support for the self-governing island to the impact of US aid to Ukraine in combating Russia’s invasion. Blumenthal said, “China is watching what we do in Ukraine” as it considers potential actions in neighboring Taiwan. “She should have gone, I’m glad she went,” Graham said. “If she hadn’t gone, what would that have sent a signal to the Iranians and to the Russians?” Upcoming Senate agenda Though Graham and Blumenthal were split on the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats’ sweeping climate and health care bill that is being debated in the Senate on Sunday, the senators both advocated more bipartisan gun legislation. The two senators, who both supported the gun safety legislation passed earlier this year, said there were more gun safety overhauls they both want to see passed. They specifically highlighted a proposal to empower judges and law enforcement to restrict gun access to those who may pose a threat to others.  “I think what we can do is incentivize states to give them the tools they need to deal with this before it’s too late,” Graham said, stressing that his proposal would not be a “national ‘red flag’ law.” “The common ground that I think we share and many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share: Keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, but through due process,” Blumenthal said. The two stood by their respective party’s positions when asked about Democrats’ climate and health care bill. Blumenthal said the bill would deliver “historic” cost savings to Americans, while Graham said the legislation is “gonna make everything worse.” Blumenthal and Graham also split on whether Congress should codify the right to marriage for same-sex couples. Though some Republicans have said they would side with Democrats on the bill, Graham said he believes same-sex marriage laws should be decided by the states. When asked if the US Supreme Court decision affirming the right to same-sex marriage should be overturned, Graham replied: “Well, that’d be up to the court.”  2024 election Blumenthal, who is up for reelection this year, did not say whether or not he wants Biden to run for reelection in 2024, saying instead that he is concentrating on this year’s midterms. “I’m going to be very blunt and very honest with you. My focus is totally on this November,” Blumenthal said. He continued: “I will support President Biden if he decides he wants to run and I think his decision will be determined by how November ends for the Democratic Party and for senators like myself who are running for reelection.” Graham, in contrast, reiterated his support for Donald Trump and said he would support the former President if he runs for a second term in 2024. However, Graham said Trump should refrain from bringing up election conspiracies if he runs again, noting: “I don’t believe the election was stolen.” But he added that he wants to “look at election integrity measures.” “I think we should look at election integrity measures to make sure some problems don’t happen again. But if he runs for president, talking about 2020 is not what people want to hear,” Graham said. Graham has been subpoenaed by an Atlanta-area grand jury investigating efforts made by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. Graham has filed a motion to block the subpoena.",Donald Trump;Vladimir Putin;Lindsey Graham;Richard Blumenthal;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden;Volodymyr Zelensky,Senate On;Upcoming Senate;Us Supreme Court;Us

Sales jumped 10% from the same quarter of 2019, before the pandemic, to $46 billion, as demand for leisure travel surged. The airlines reported record bookings in June for travel during the rest of the summer. But carriers are flying with fewer seats available than before the pandemic: capacity at the four largest airlines is down about 13% from three years ago.  That combination of very strong demand and limited availability sent fares soaring. Soaring fares, canceled flights The amount passengers paid to fly each mile on the big four carriers was up 19.3% in the second quarter compared to 2019. Another measure of fares that compares passenger revenue to capacity rose 22%.  But those increases don’t tell the whole story. Business and international travel hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. Those tickets typically cost much more than domestic airfare. Unlike previous years, when airlines could avoid some fare hikes for leisure travelers by jacking up tickets for business and international passengers, this year the bulk of fare increases are hitting domestic fliers. “The leisure traveler is taking it on the chin right now and they’re willing to do so,” said Jim Corridore, senior insights manager for research firm Similarweb. Service has become a massive problem as well.  About 134,000 US flights have been canceled so far this year, according to tracking service Flight Aware, more than twice as many as were canceled in the same period last year. That represents 2.6% of all scheduled flights so far this year.  Staffing shortage also hitting passengers Airlines don’t have sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations. The shortage of pilots has also prompted airlines to stop or slash service to dozens of smaller markets, greatly limiting or even ending air service for many communities. During the pandemic, carriers offered early retirement and other buyout packages to make voluntary reductions in staffing. All of them are still struggling to get operations back to normal as they scramble to hire and train the staff necessary to restore capacity.  “A lot of pilots retired. It’s not easy to replace them,” said Corridore. “It’s a long process, it’s still going to be a year or so to have the airlines have a full schedule that this level of demand will dictate.” Complaints also soar Passenger complaints to the Department of Transportation have soared to more than triple pre-pandemic levels.  Senators Elizabeth Warren and Alex Padilla urged Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last month to crack down on the airline industry. The Department of Transportation announced new rules Wednesday that would require refunds if a flight is canceled or disrupted, including three-hour or longer delays on domestic flights, six-hour delays on international flights, a change in aircraft type or an increase in the number of connections on a trip.  But in a deregulated industry, there’s little Buttigieg can do about the fares themselves. Mergers mean fewer choices Many blame the consolidation in the industry over the last 20 years for the current state of travel. Today’s four dominant carriers were created from 10 airlines through a series of mergers. And another merger was just announced last week that many fear will once again lead to higher prices.  Spirit\n            \n                (SAVE), a pioneer in offering very low base fares which are then supplemented by fees for all manner of extras, had put pressure on the bigger airlines to offer similar frill-free seats at a lower price.  But Spirit recently agreed to be purchased by JetBlue Airways\n            \n                (JBLU) for $3.8 billion in cash. The combination will form the country’s fifth largest airline, which JetBlue says will create more competition among its four larger rivals. But other experts say the loss of Spirit, if the merger is approved, can only mean higher fares down the road. “Fares are likely to rise if a disruptive price competitor is going away,” Corridore said.",Jim Corridore;Alex Padilla;Elizabeth Warren;Pete Buttigieg,American Airlines;Spirit Airlines;Spirit Airlines;Department Of Transportation;Department Of Transportation;Jetblue;Jetblue;Jetblue;Jetblue;Jetblue Airways;Denver International Airport,"TAX_FNCACT_SENATORS,3261;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3261;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2346;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,1683;SHORTAGE,294;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,4050;DELAY,959;DELAY,1879;DELAY,2161;DELAY,3505;TAX_FNCACT_PIONEER,4115;GENERAL_HEALTH,550;GENERAL_HEALTH,770;GENERAL_HEALTH,2668;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,550;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,770;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,2668;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,550;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,770;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,2668;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,550;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,770;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2668;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,550;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,770;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2668;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,550;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,770;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2668;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,550;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,770;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2668;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,550;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,770;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2668;TAX_DISEASE_DISRUPTIVE,4816;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,357;GEN_HOLIDAY,1915;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1219;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1457;ECON_DEREGULATION,3713;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1309;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,3610;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,2869;TAX_FNCACT_PILOTS,2503;TAX_FNCACT_PILOTS,2928;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,1813;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1813;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1813;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,1813;WB_1676_EARLY_RETIREMENT,2704;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,2704;WB_1673_PASSIVE_LABOR_MARKETS_POLICIES,2704;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,2704;USPEC_POLICY1,2477;RETIREMENT,2704;WB_2690_CATEGORIES_OF_EMPLOYMENT,2704;WB_2670_JOBS,2704;WB_2689_JOBS_DIAGNOSTICS,2704;WB_2896_RETIREMENT,2704;SOC_SERVICEDISRUPTION,265;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2388;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,3554;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,3585;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,3364;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,3324;",American;New York,940
309,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/primary-election-august-10-what-to-watch/,"Summer break is over. With fewer than 100 days until the general election, the final rounds of 2022 midterms primaries will come fast and furious over the next six weeks, beginning with a busy Tuesday featuring key contests around the country. Former President Donald Trump’s influence is again looming over Republican Senate primaries, this time in Arizona and Missouri, while GOP House members in Washington state and Michigan face a conservative backlash over their votes to impeach Trump after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection. Michigan GOP Rep. Peter Meijer’s challenge from an election-denying Trump ally has attracted an extra dose of national interest thanks to Democratic campaign leadership, which has invested in propping up his right-wing opponent – a controversial tactic meant to engineer a better matchup for Democrats this fall.  The meddling has come under fire from not only Meijer, but Democrats worried it will undermine their attempts to criticize extremism in the GOP and backfire in the November elections. On the Democratic side, Michigan is home to a handful of competitive House primaries, including one that pits a pair of incumbents, Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin, against one another in a campaign that has attracted heavy investments from competing pro-Israel groups. Kansas, meanwhile, will host one of the first major post-Roe votes when the state conducts a referendum to determine whether its constitution protects the right to an abortion. If the measure succeeds, state lawmakers are expected to quickly move to enshrine a ban.  Here are eight things to watch on Tuesday:  Arizona governor primary pits Trump against Pence The race to replace term-limited Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, pits Ducey’s chosen candidate, Karrin Taylor Robson, against a Trump-endorsed former television journalist Kari Lake.  Lake has built her campaign around lies about election fraud. She referred to the refusal of her leading rival, Ducey-backed Robson, to indulge those lies as “disqualifying.”  Robson, meanwhile, is also backed by former Vice President Mike Pence, who visited Arizona to campaign with Robson and Ducey last month on the same day Trump held a rally at which Lake spoke.  Pence used his Arizona trip to urge the GOP to move past Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election and look forward.  “When you get out and vote for Karrin Taylor Robson, you can send a deafening message that will be heard all across America that the Republican Party is the party of the future,” Pence said in Peoria, Arizona. Arizona GOP could pick full slate of election deniers Beyond the governor’s office, the Arizona GOP could be poised to nominate a statewide ticket of Trump-backed election deniers on Tuesday.  The race for secretary of state — Arizona’s chief elections officer — also features an election denier endorsed by Trump in Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker who wrongly claims that Trump on the 2020 election and was in Washington January 6.  Trump-backed Blake Masters, who is seeking to face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, hasn’t just claimed that Democrats “pulled out all the stops” to cheat in 2020, but has suggested the 2022 midterms won’t be fair. Masters faces other Republicans who have rejected the 2020 election outcome, including businessman Jim Lamon, who touts his efforts to fund the bogus review of Maricopa County’s 2020 results. Another Senate candidate, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, sent a letter claiming to have uncovered election fraud, without detailing any fraud in how the election was managed.  Trump’s chosen candidate in the race for attorney general, Abraham Hamadeh, said he would “take the fraud in our 2020 election seriously and bring justice to those who’ve undermined our Republic.” Meijer faces Dem-backed, far-right challenge Rep. Peter Meijer, the freshman Republican from western Michigan who was one of his party’s 10 House members to vote for Trump’s second impeachment, is facing off against a Trump-endorsed challenger in John Gibbs.  Gibbs has fully embraced Trump’s election lies. He wrongly claimed in a debate with Meijer that the results that led to Biden’s win in 2020 were “simply mathematically impossible” and said that there were “anomalies in there, to put it very lightly.”  What’s unique about the GOP contest in the Grand Rapids-based 3rd District is that Democrats have attempted to boost Gibbs with ads casting him as a Trump-aligned conservative.  It’s a calculated gamble for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has spent more than $300,000 on ads in the race: They believe Gibbs would be much easier to defeat in November, so they are attempting to elevate him Tuesday, and then turn and immediately cast him as a threat to democracy in the general election.  A pro-Meijer group launched a television ad over the weekend highlighting Democrats’ involvement in the Republican primary. “Fox News confirms it: Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to elect their hand-picked candidate for Congress in the Republican primary, John Gibbs,” the group’s ad warns. “West Michigan must say no to Nancy Pelosi’s handpicked candidate for Congress.” Trump hedges on scandal-plagued Greitens in Missouri  A little more than four years ago, Eric Greitens resigned as Missouri governor as he faced an ethics probe and allegations he abused and tried to blackmail a woman with whom had an affair. Prosecutors ultimately dropped felony charges.   More recently, his ex-wife accused him of violent and unstable behavior in a court filing related to a child custody dispute. (Greitens denied the claims.) Now, the former Navy SEAL is one of the frontrunners in what recent polling suggests will be a tight Missouri GOP Senate primary, with a field that includes Greitens, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt and US Rep. Vicky Hartzler. Even Trump, whom Greitens has sought to align himself with, is hedging – likely because he fears Greitens could be defeated in a general election. On Monday evening, Trump put out a statement endorsing “Eric.” Which one? On that question, Trump wrote, Missouri Republicans would need to “make up their own minds.” Rep. Billy Long, Missouri state Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz and Mark McCloskey, a lawyer who became famous after he and wife wielded firearms from their property as a protest against police violence passed by in June 2020, are also part of a crowded field of Republican hopefuls. Democrats will choose from Trudy Busch Valentine, a retired nurse and beer fortune heiress; attorney and Marine veteran Lucas Kunce; and Spencer Toder in their primary. Abortion on the ballot for the first time since SCOTUS decision For the first time since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion will be on a ballot. Kansas voters will decide, via a somewhat convoluted question, whether to keep the constitution as is, which the state Supreme Court previously ruled protects abortion rights – a “no” vote – or vote “yes” and change the state’s constitution to specify that the right to an abortion is not guaranteed in the state. The vote, in addition to being key to the future of abortions in Kansas, is widely seen as a referendum on whether abortion politics have truly shifted in the wake of the Supreme Court decision earlier this year. Democrats are hopeful that the decision has invigorated voters to oppose anti-abortion measures. This will be part of a big election year in Kansas. Democrat Gov. Laura Kelly, who opposed the amendment, is up for reelection in November, representing one of the most vulnerable Democratic gubernatorial incumbents in the country.  “The amendment is written in such a way that the proponents of the amendment want to suggest that this would just leave things as they are in Kansas. But that’s not true,” Kelly said in late July. “What would happen if that amendment would pass is that the Legislature would immediately come back with some very severe restrictions on a woman’s ability to control her own fate.” Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who is all but certain to be the party’s nominee for governor, has said he would vote yes for the amendment. Whitmer gets her challenger Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on the short list for Biden’s vice presidential nod less than two years into her first term, gets her Republican challenger in Tuesday’s primary.  Trump on Friday endorsed Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator who has falsely claimed that Trump won the 2020 election. She is also backed by Michigan’s GOP establishment, including former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s family, the state Chamber of Commerce and Michigan Right to Life.  That GOP gubernatorial primary features several other election deniers, as well. One candidate, Ryan Kelley, was in Washington on January 6, 2021, and has pled not guilty to four misdemeanor charges stemming from allegations of his participation in the riot at the Capitol. Retired pastor Ralph Rebandt said he is “convinced that we would find the fraud” in the 2020 election with a “full forensic audit.” And chiropractor Garrett Soldano has touted a film that promotes an unproven conspiracy theory about the 2020 election.  Republicans in Michigan are poised to nominate election deniers for their entire slate of statewide offices. The party is also expected to pick Trump-backed election deniers in the races for secretary of state and attorney general. At a convention in April, the state GOP endorsed Kristina Karamo, an educator and right-wing commentator who claimed to have witnessed irregularities in 2020’s election, for secretary of state, and Matthew DePerno, who was a lawyer on a case challenging the 2020 results, for attorney general. But those races aren’t on Tuesday’s primary ballot; instead, Republicans will make their choices official at a party convention in August.  Democratic House incumbents clash after redistricting draws them into new district   Redistricting in Michigan laid the groundwork for a Stevens-Levin contest in the state’s newly-drawn 11th Congressional District. Both candidates have claims to the seat, though some moderate Democrats expressed frustration that Levin didn’t try his hand in the open 10th District. But the bigger story here has been animated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee involvement and spending by its new super PAC, United Democracy Project, with the latter having backed Stevens with more than $4 million in outside expenditures.  Levin, a Jewish progressive whose family has a storied history in Michigan politics, now enters primary day as an underdog despite a late boost from J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group attempting to blunt some of AIPAC’s influence with an ad buy worth about $700,000.  Notably, Israel policy has not been a theme – it’s barely mentioned – in either candidate’s campaigns or the ads from the competing groups. But Levin, the lead sponsor of the Two-State Solution Act, has been more willing to criticize the Israeli government.  Progressives have been scathing in their criticism of Democrats, like Stevens, who have accepted help from AIPAC, which also contributes to Republicans, including many who voted against certifying Biden’s 2020 election win. (AIPAC has essentially ignored the backlash, pointing to the Democrats it backs and saying it can’t advance its policy goals without bipartisan support.) Another well-known progressive, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, has attracted less attention from pro-Israel groups and, despite an influx of moderate outside cash against her, is the favorite to win nomination again in the redrawn 12th District. How much does Trump’s impeachment still matter? A lot has changed in the last 18 months since Trump was impeached for a second time. But two Republican incumbents – Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will face voters for the first time since joining Democrats to impeach the then-President. A flurry of factors – not only how removed politics is from that impeachment vote – have Republicans in Washington skeptical that both Herrera Beutler and Newhouse will be ousted: Both incumbents have outspent their challengers, the fields are large and fractured and Washington State’s open primary system allows people to vote for any candidate, regardless of affiliation. “If the vote was held a month (after the impeachment decision), they probably would have lost,” said a top Washington Republican operative. “But given 9% inflation, given the high gas prices we saw, if you are talking with conservative voters, they may be more concerned with the current situation in the country than they are 16 or 18 months ago.” Herrera Beutler is facing author Heidi St. John, who has received a burst of super PAC money; state Rep. Vicki Kraft; and retired special forces officer Joe Kent, who Trump has backed. While Newhouse faces former NASCAR driver Jarod Sessler, state Rep. Brad Klippert and vocal election denier Loren Culp, who has been endorsed by Trump. Herrera Beutler and Newhouse aren’t the only decisions for Republicans on Tuesday. The party will also look to nominate a candidate to face Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. Tiffany Smiley is seen as the leading Republican in the race, but Washington voters have not been represented by a Republican in the Senate since 2001.",Mark Finchem;Donald Trump;Karrin Taylor Robson;Karrin Taylor Robson;Peter Meijer;Doug Ducey;Haley Stevens;Andy Levin;Mike Pence,Republican Senate;Republican Party;Cnn;Meijer;Meijer,"BAN,1561;EXTREMISM,733;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,1759;ELECTION_FRAUD,1911;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,2086;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENTS,1141;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1623;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,2623;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,1514;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,1514;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKER,2907;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,814;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,895;TAX_FNCACT_JOURNALIST,1837;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,2795;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,2773;TAX_FNCACT_ENGINEER,783;MEDIA_MSM,1826;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,2484;CORRUPTION,1911;CORRUPTION,2300;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,1911;WB_2019_ANTI_CORRUPTION_LEGISLATION,2300;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1911;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2300;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1911;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2300;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1911;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2300;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,1911;WB_2020_BRIBERY_FRAUD_AND_COLLUSION,2300;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,296;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1729;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2478;LEADER,243;LEADER,2086;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,243;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2086;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,243;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2086;TERROR,959;TREASON,514;IMPEACHMENT,473;ELECTION,68;ELECTION,1905;ELECTION,2318;ELECTION,2593;ELECTION,2719;ELECTION,2847;ELECTION,2955;CONSTITUTIONAL,1437;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2813;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2813;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2764;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_PARTY_OF_THE_FUTURE,2511;TAX_FNCACT_TELEVISION_JOURNALIST,1837;",Israel;Kansas;Michigan;Arizona;America;Washington;Missouri,2749
193,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/monkeypox-public-health-emergency/,"The Biden administration on Thursday declared monkeypox a public health emergency, with cases on the rise across the US. The announcement came during a briefing with the Department of Health and Human Services.  The administration has been criticized at times for its handling of the outbreak, and some have called on the government to declare a national emergency without delay.  Since the first US monkeypox case was identified in mid-May, more than 6,600 probable or confirmed cases have been detected in the United States. Cases have been identified in every state except Montana and Wyoming. The declaration follows the World Health Organization announcement last month that monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.” Some cities and states, including New York City, San Francisco, California, Illinois and New York, have already declared monkeypox an emergency, allowing them to free up funding and resources for their responses to the outbreak. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden named Robert Fenton as the White House’s national monkeypox response coordinator. Fenton – a regional Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator who oversees Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada – will coordinate the federal government’s response to the outbreak. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s director of the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, serves as the deputy coordinator. The Biden administration has been heavily criticized by some public health experts for not moving faster to address the crisis. One of the criticisms of the administration’s response, as CNN reported earlier Thursday, was that HHS waited more than three weeks after the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the US to order bulk stocks of the monkeypox vaccine, which the government owns and stores in Denmark, be bottled and sent to the US for distribution. The delay was in part out of concern that once those vaccines were taken out of bulk storage, they would lose years of shelf life. Monkeypox can infect anyone, but the majority of cases in the US outbreak have been among men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men and people who identify as transgender. Close contact with an infected individual is required for the spread of the monkeypox virus, experts say. The CDC initially announced vaccines for monkeypox were being released from the Strategic National Stockpile and offered to the “high-risk” contacts of monkeypox patients, as well as the health care workers treating them. Federal health officials have since expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that makes up most US monkeypox cases. In addition to providing vaccines, the CDC has said since June it has made a concerted effort to do extensive education and outreach to the LGBTQ community. Possible change to how vaccine is administered Health officials are considering changing the way monkeypox vaccine doses are administered because the country is “at a critical inflection point” with the virus’ spread, US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told reporters on Thursday.  “In recent days, it’s become clear to all of us that given the continued spread of the virus, we’re at a critical inflection point, dictating the need for additional solutions to address the rise in infection rates,” Califf said. “The goal has always been to vaccinate as many people as possible.” The commissioner said officials are considering allowing health care providers to be able to use a dose-sharing method where one vial of Jynneos vaccine – previously used as one dose – will be used to administer up to five separate doses.  This approach would change the way Jynneos is administered, Califf said. Instead of the vaccine being administered in the fat layer under the skin, it will be delivered underneath the skin layer. “There are some advantages to intradermal administration including an improved immune response to the vaccine,” Califf said. “It’s important to note that overall safety and efficacy profile will not be sacrificed for this approach. Please know, we’ve been exploring all scientifically feasible options and we believe this could be a promising approach.” This story has been updated with additional information.

671,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/entertainment/olivia-newton-john-obit/,"Olivia Newton-John, the Australian singer whose breathy voice and wholesome beauty made her one of the biggest pop stars of the ’70s and charmed generations of viewers in the blockbuster movie “Grease,” died on Monday, according to a statement from her husband. She was 73. “Dame Olivia Newton-John passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time,” her husband, John Easterling, wrote in a statement on the singer’s verified Instagram account. “Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.” The singer revealed in September 2018 that she was treating cancer at the base of her spine. It was her third cancer diagnosis, following bouts with breast cancer in the early ’90s and in 2017.  Her rise to fame Thanks to a string of country and soft-rock hits, Newton-John was already a popular singer by the late 1970s. But her co-starring role opposite John Travolta in 1978’s “Grease,” arguably the most popular movie musical of all time, lifted her to a new level of stardom.   Although she had little acting experience (and turned 29 during filming), Newton-John gave an indelible performance as Sandy, a sweet-natured Australian transfer student who romances Travolta’s alpha greaser Danny at a Southern California high school in the 1950s.  Their onscreen chemistry as mismatched lovebirds who undergo final-act makeovers to win each others’ hearts – she ditches her frilly dresses for heels, leather, spandex and a cigarette – anchored the movie and inspired repeat viewings by legions of fans.   “I don’t think anyone could have imagined a movie would go on almost 40 years and would still be popular and people would still be talking to me about it all the time and loving it,” Newton-John told CNN in 2017. “It’s just one of those movies. I’m very lucky to have been a part of it. It’s given so many people pleasure.”  Newton-John sang on three of the movie’s biggest hits: the duets “You’re The One That I Want” and “Summer Nights” with Travolta, and her swoony solo ballad, “Hopelessly Devoted To You.”   Born in Cambridge, England in 1948, Newton-John moved with her family to Melbourne, Australia, when she was five. After winning a talent contest on a TV show, “Sing, Sing, Sing,” as a teen she formed an all-girl group and began appearing on weekly pop music programs in Australia.  Newton-John recorded her first single in England in 1966 and scored a few international hits, but she remained largely unknown to US audiences until 1973, when “Let Me Be There” became a top-10 hit on both the adult contemporary and the country charts.   A series of No. 1 easy-listening hits followed, including “I Honestly Love You,” “Have You Never Been Mellow” and “Please Mr. Please.”  Then came “Grease,” which was 1978’s top-grossing movie and became an enduring cultural phenomenon.  The movie gave Newton-John an opportunity to change her squeaky-clean image. The cover of her next album, “Totally Hot,” featured the singer in black leather, while its songs had an edgier, more contemporary pop sound.  Her singing success  In 1981, she took her new, sexier persona a step further with “Physical,” a dance number with such suggestive lyrics as, “There’s nothing left to talk about unless it’s horizontally.” Banned by several radio stations, it became her biggest hit, spending 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.  She also appeared in several more big-budget movies, including the musical fantasy “Xanadu” with Hollywood legend Gene Kelly in his final screen role. The film bombed, but its soundtrack sold well and spawned “Magic,” a No. 1 hit.  In 1983 she teamed with Travolta again for “Two of a Kind,” a romantic comedy-fantasy, but it failed to recapture their “Grease” spark.  Over a lengthy career Newton-John won four Grammy Awards and sold more than 100 million albums.  “I’ve had many lives in music. I’ve had country when when I started, then I crossed over into pop,” she told CNN. “I had ‘Xanadu’ and ‘Grease,’ many songs in between. I feel very grateful. I have such a large repertoire to choose from.”  Overcoming tragedy But Newton-John also faced her share of troubles and tragedy. Her breast cancer diagnoses forced her to postpone and cancel several tours. And in 2005 Newton-John’s then-boyfriend, Patrick McDermott, disappeared at sea while on a fishing trip off the coast of California. He was never found – an unsolved mystery that haunted the singer for years.   “It’s very hard to live with that,” she told CNN’s Larry King in 2006. “It’s probably the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve been through a lot of things.” Although her career profile dimmed in her later years, Newton-John never stopped recording and performing. Among her highlights were guest appearances on “Glee,” a long-running “Summer Nights” residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas and a dance-club hit, “You Have to Believe,” recorded with daughter Chloe.   “I love to sing, it’s all I know how to do,” she told CNN in 2017. “That’s all I’ve ever done since I was 15, so it’s my life. I feel very grateful that I can still do it and people still come to see me.”",Larry King;Patrick Mcdermott;Dame Olivia Newton-John;Gene Kelly;Olivia Newton-John;Olivia Newton-John;Olivia Newton-John;Olivia Newton-John;Olivia Newton-John;John Travolta;John Travolta;John Travolta;John Easterling,Instagram;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Flamingo Las Vegas,"DELAY,4504;MARITIME_INCIDENT,4604;MARITIME,4604;EDUCATION,1509;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1509;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1509;BAN,3442;WB_2670_JOBS,4087;WB_2670_JOBS,4905;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4087;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4905;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,4087;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,4905;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,4087;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,4905;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,4087;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,4905;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,439;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,678;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,744;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,794;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,841;TAX_DISEASE_CANCER,4471;WB_1406_DISEASES,678;WB_1406_DISEASES,744;WB_1406_DISEASES,794;WB_1406_DISEASES,841;WB_1406_DISEASES,4471;WB_1431_CANCER,678;WB_1431_CANCER,744;WB_1431_CANCER,794;WB_1431_CANCER,841;WB_1431_CANCER,4471;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,678;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,744;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,794;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,841;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,4471;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,678;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,744;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,794;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,841;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,4471;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,1430;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,39;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1413;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,46;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,559;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,691;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,977;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,3155;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,4720;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,4393;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,4452;TAX_DISEASE_BREAST_CANCER,678;TAX_DISEASE_BREAST_CANCER,841;TAX_DISEASE_BREAST_CANCER,4471;KILL,204;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,204;USPEC_POLICY1,3507;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,3507;MEDIA_MSM,2421;MEDIA_MSM,3583;MEDIA_MSM,3660;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,1509;TAX_FNCACT_KING,4790;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,3164;",Melbourne;Australia;Cambridge;Australian;Hollywood;Las Vegas;California,1240
152,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/media/infowars-alex-jones-legal-team-mistrial-denied/,"A Texas judge on Thursday denied a request for a mistrial from the attorney for right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in a trial that will decide how much in damages is awarded to the parents of a Sandy Hook victim who won a default judgment against Jones.  A hearing about the request for a mistrial, which was held as the jury conducted its first day of deliberations on defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, was centered around a disclosure in court on Wednesday.  In a stunning moment as he cross-examined Jones on Wednesday, Mark Bankston, the attorney for the Sandy Hook parents, revealed Jones’ attorney had “messed up” and sent him two years of records from Jones’ phone.  Jones’ attorney, Federico Andino Reynal, on Thursday requested at the hearing that Bankston delete the phone records and asked for a mistrial. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, who is overseeing the case, suggested to Reynal she could not tell whether his motion for a mistrial was serious or not. She noted he has repeatedly moved for a mistrial during various court proceedings and been denied each time. After Reynal indicated he was serious in asking for a mistrial, Gamble denied the request. Reynal also asked for 10 days to review the phone records so that he could move to prevent the release of some of the information in them as privileged. Gamble denied his request to receive 10 days, but did give him some time to him to review the material and research whether any privileges apply.  “I think you should try to work on it today and see what you can get done,” Gamble said.  During the hearing, Bankston said that the committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol has expressed interest in obtaining Jones’ phone records. Bankston said he has also received interest in the records from law enforcement and other parties suing Jones over his lies regarding the Sandy Hook shooting.  Bankston said he was inclined to turn that information over, barring an order from the judge not to do so.  “I don’t know that you get to stop that anyway,” Gamble said in reference to the January 6th committee requesting the material, noting they would likely subpoena it if it wasn’t voluntarily handed over. Bankston declined to tell CNN which law enforcement agencies might have expressed interest to him about Jones’ phone records. The January 6th committee had no comment on the matter Thursday.  Jones was a central player on January 6. He was at the US Capitol riling up protesters, though he did not storm inside the building and denounced any suggestion that he had been involved in the planning of violence at the Capitol. Jones also testified before the the January 6 Committee. But he said on his show that he’d repeatedly asserted his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.",Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Mark Bankston;Federico Andino Reynal;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Alex Jones,Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,35;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,903;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,2482;TRIAL,97;TRIAL,630;TRIAL,697;TRIAL,768;TRIAL,1208;TRIAL,1310;TRIAL,2184;TRIAL,2296;",Sandy Hook;New York;Texas,577
447,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/us/florida-sailfish-stabs-woman/,"A 73-year-old woman was airlifted to a hospital after being stabbed by a 100-pound sailfish that an angler was trying to reel onto a boat off the Florida coast, officials said.  The sailfish began to charge at the boat and then jumped out of the water and stabbed the woman in the groin while she was standing next to the boat’s center console, according to the Martin County Sheriff’s Office.  It happened so fast, the woman didn’t have time to react, she told a responding officer.  The two men on the boat applied pressure to the wound right away, according to an incident report filed last week. The woman, identified as Katherine Perkins, was in a good condition in hospital Sunday, a spokesperson at HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital told CNN.  The boat was about two miles offshore from the St. Lucie Inlet when the incident took place. Sailfish have long bills, similar to those of marlins and swordfish. They are considered by many to be the fastest fish in the ocean, according to the Ocean Conservancy. The sailfish was estimated to weigh 100 pounds, according to the sheriff’s office report.

665,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/dry-lightning-wildfire-california-climate/,"Dry lightning has ignited some of the most destructive and costly wildfires in California history, a new study shows.  Researchers found that over the past few decades, nearly half of the lightning strikes that hit the ground during spring and summer had been dry — there was no rain falling nearby. Dry lightning tends to happen in storms over areas of extreme drought, like the one California has been in for the past several years. The air is so dry that the rain evaporates before it hits the ground. And the conditions that favor dry lightning are becoming more widespread and more frequent as the climate crisis fuel’s the West’s megadrought. Dmitri Kalashnikov, lead author of the paper and a doctoral student at Washington State University, pointed to the wildfires that scorched California in 2020 — particularly the August Complex Fire, the largest wildfire in the state’s history — as the motivation for the research.  The August Complex Fire was originally more than three dozen fires that were sparked by dry lightning. Those fires merged to become the largest in state history, burning more than a million acres in seven counties. California firefighters were exhausted that summer, CNN reported at the time, and they were particularly concerned about the potential for more and more fires sparked by dry lightning.  All of the seven largest fires in California history have occurred in the past five years, and four of those were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire.  “With warming and drying and drier vegetation, it doesn’t take a whole lot of lightning to start wildfires,” Kalashnikov told CNN. “So even if, on the off chance, dry lightning decreases in the future, it just takes one outbreak one day in a year to cause a lot of fire and a lot of damage, if that were to happen.” The study, funded by NASA and published Monday in the journal Environmental Research: Climate, is the first to develop long-term climatology of dry lightning in California, specifically focusing on Central and Northern California, an area where lightning is a significant cause of wildfire.  Dry lightning was found to occur most frequently in July and August, the researchers found, though lower elevation regions tended to see activity peak later in September and October, when vegetation is even drier. Researchers found that around Sacramento, San Francisco, Redwood, Sequoia and Yosemite, lightning sparked nearly 30%, of fires which accounted for nearly 50% of the total burned area.  “That is a lot of fires started by lightning, which are usually more difficult to attack because they tend to be more remote than human caused fires,” Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist and lightning applications manager at Vaisala, told CNN.   Vagasky, who is not involved with the study, said the findings provide “excellent background” for weather forecasting and wildland management communities to better determine the conditions that are favorable for dry lightning to occur in advance.  “This really highlights the importance of understanding when dry lightning can be expected so that crews can be at the ready in the event of fire starting,” he said. “So it’s good to see that there is now a study for this region of the US that shows not just the time of year, but the type of meteorological conditions that appear favorable for dry lightning.”  The research is just the first step, Vagasky said. “When thunderstorms do develop, first responders need to be aware that dry lightning conditions may be possible, but they will also have to be able to quickly respond to areas that are impacted,” he added. Kalashnikov said there are still uncertainties when it comes to lightning research, whether dry lightning will occur more often as the climate changes. But one thing is certain, he said, as the Western drought persists, conditions are much more favorable for dry lightning to take shape. In just the last year alone, dry lightning has sparked deadly and destructive wildfires such as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon that burned more than 400,000 acres. “We know it’s getting hotter and drier — California is becoming hotter and drier,” Kalashnikov said. “So we can say that no matter what the trend in lightning is doing, when lightning happens with a hotter, drier atmosphere and vegetation, it’s just going to lead to more of a risk of these kinds of wildfire outbreaks like we saw in 2020.”",Chris Vagasky,Washington State University;Vaisala;Environmental Research;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2995;WB_1777_FORESTS,2995;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2995;TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,2826;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,2859;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2779;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,865;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2218;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,4807;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,368;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4267;WB_569_HYDROMET_SERVICES,3130;WB_568_CLIMATE_SERVICES,3130;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,709;SCIENCE,135;SCIENCE,2305;SCIENCE,2448;WB_571_CLIMATE_SCIENCE,2069;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,2069;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,4468;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,606;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2022;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4202;WATER_SECURITY,285;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,78;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,767;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,1722;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,4433;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,78;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,767;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,1722;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,4433;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1844;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1844;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1844;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1844;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1844;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1844;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,675;EDUCATION,740;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,740;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,613;WB_137_WATER,3656;WB_137_WATER,3747;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,613;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,613;",San Francisco;Oregon;Sacramento;Nebraska;Klamath;Colorado;California,889
226,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/lake-mead-remains-homicide-investigation-autopsies/,"For investigators working on the cases of people whose remains were found on the shore of Lake Mead, time is the enemy. The bodies – one of which was found in a corroding barrel with a gunshot wound – could have been submerged in the lake’s depths decades ago, leaving the three sets of remains in advanced stages of decomposition and making it increasingly difficult to extract DNA. But officials have already discovered key details, which they revealed to CNN, including confirmation that the gunshot victim’s death was a homicide. When police arrived at the lake’s Hemenway Harbor on May 1 to investigate the discovery of a set of remains in a barrel, investigators immediately treated it as a homicide investigation, not waiting to get a confirmation from the coroner, Lt. Jason Johansson of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police homicide unit told CNN. The gunshot wound was obvious, he said, and the circumstances clearly suspicious.   Clark County Coroner Melanie Rouse has since preliminarily ruled the cause and manner of death was homicide by gunshot and also said her office is submitting specimens from the remains to try to extract DNA. If DNA is found, it will also be sent to the FBI, which is assisting in the case, she said.  The remains, dubbed Hemenway Harbor Doe by the coroner’s office, are one of at least three sets uncovered due to the dramatically receding water levels at Lake Mead, which has plunged to unprecedented lows amid a critical water crisis in the West.  Police previously announced they placed the Hemenway Harbor Doe’s approximate time of death as sometime in the mid-’70s to early ‘80s,  based on the victim’s clothes and shoes. Johansson told CNN that the clothing was so well preserved in the freshwater environment that investigators were still able to read the clothing labels.  But without an ID, investigators are extremely limited. And the more time passes, the harder it will be to identify aging witnesses and potential suspects.  “If you think about what the age of who your witnesses or anybody related to this case would be, many of them are getting older every day. And they’re at an age where you have to worry, are they even alive? And so I would say that’s probably our biggest concern right now,” Johansson said.  Rouse has preliminarily determined that the age of the person in the second set of remains – found on May 7 at Calville Bay – is approximately between 23 and 37 years old. While she couldn’t confidently determine how the person died – meaning the preliminary cause of death is undetermined – the coroner’s office is sending specimens to be examined for any potential DNA.  The Calville Bay remains are more skeletal than the other two sets, Rouse said, which both still have organ tissue available for examination, despite being immersed in the lake. The cooler underwater temperatures would cause a body to decompose more slowly than if it were baking under the desert sun, she explained.  The final remains were found at the lake’s Swim Beach on July 25 and the examination is still at an early stage, Rouse said. Unlike the other two, these are only partial remains and Rouse is still processing them to determine what can even be examined based on their condition, she said.  The remains are undergoing toxicology and other testing before a cause and manner of death can be determined, the coroner said.  Police are not investigating the other two sets of remains because there is so far no sign of foul play or suspicious circumstances in the deaths, Johansson said, but he has no doubt the circumstances of the Hemenway Harbor Doe’s death are nefarious.  “Anytime you have a body in a barrel, clearly there was somebody else involved,” he said.  No strong connection to organized crime yet, police say Theories of mob involvement in the Hemenway Harbor Doe’s death began to swirl as soon as details emerged that the remains were found inside a barrel. Those ideas were fueled even more when police announced the victim was likely killed at a time when organized crime had a strong grasp on Las Vegas.  But those ideas are “mere speculation” at this point in the investigation, Johansson said, denying that there is any solid evidence to support mob theories.  “Yes, Vegas does have a history in the past where we had a connection to violent crime, to organized crime back in the ’60s, the 70s,” he said. “However, right now, there’s nothing in this investigation that is directly tying it organized crime.” At its height in 1983, Lake Mead was 1,225 feet above sea level. But as the climate crisis fuels a prolonged mega-drought in the West, the lake, which serves as the nation’s largest reservoir, has plummeted to sobering levels. This year it hit its lowest level since it was filled in the 1930s. One possible scenario for the second two remains is that they belong to people who previously drowned at the lake when water levels were high, a National Parks Service spokesperson told CNN. Recovery divers are limited on how deep they can go, so some drowning victims’ remains do not get recovered, they said.   “The lake has drained dramatically over the last 15 years,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Homicide Lt. Ray Spencer said in May. “It’s likely that we will find additional bodies that have been dumped in Lake Mead” as the water level drops further. The dropping water level has exposed a WW II-era landing craft, wrecked boats and the lake’s original 1971 water intake valve, and officials expect more surprises may be in store.  How the coroner’s office conducts examinations In addition to traditional autopsies, examiners at the Clark County coroner’s office have a number of techniques they can use to uncover details about a body, including X-rays, fingerprinting, forensic dentistry and analysis by forensic anthropologists, Rouse said.   “In cases where we are limited [on identification methods], we would also conduct DNA analysis,” she said, noting that method may not be ideal for some extremely decomposed remains.   For the two sets of Lake Mead remains from which the office is trying to extract DNA, those specimens would have to be sent to a lab, she said.   The condition of the body is essential in the examination process, she said, because more degraded remains may not be able to be fingerprinted or provide dental information. The coroner’s office was able to perform forensic dentistry on the first two sets of Lake Mead remains, she said.   Examiners then compare the dental information to a dental records database, she said, so it’s especially important to investigators that a person’s dental records were submitted to the database. Otherwise, there will be no match.   The coroner’s office is sharing its findings with law enforcement, she said, including the FBI in the case of the homicide victim.   The FBI reached out to Las Vegas police to offer help in the investigation because the body was found on National Park Service land, Johansson said. The agency, which had a lively presence in the area during the mob’s heyday, also offered the assistance of its Organized Crime Task Force if local police need it, he said.

453,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/ohio-quadruple-murders-suspect-arrested/,"A suspect in the shooting deaths of four people at multiple sites outside of Dayton, Ohio, has been arrested, police said.  Stephen Marlow was taken into custody Saturday night by police in Lawrence, Kansas, Butler Township Police Chief John Porter said at a news conference. Marlow was wanted in connection with the Friday shootings in Butler Township, a small town north of Dayton. The arrest comes a day after the victims were found at multiple crime scenes. A motive for the shootings is still unclear.  Lawrence police “had reason to believe” Marlow was in their city and launched a city-wide search for the suspect, the Lawrence Police Department said in a statement.  A Lawrence police officer called for additional personnel after noticing a vehicle matching the description of the car the suspect was believed to be driving, according to the statement. As the officers were on the way, the vehicle turned into a parking lot and Marlow stepped out, Lawrence police said. After he exited the car, police arrested him, the statement said.   Authorities had described Marlow as likely armed and dangerous. “Stephen Marlow remains the primary suspect,” Butler Township Police said in a Facebook statement Saturday. “We have no current information to make us believe others were involved in these horrific acts.” “Following the shootings, it appears Stephen Marlow drove to Interstate 70 and headed west,” the statement added, noting they believed he had left Ohio. Law enforcement agencies in multiple states have been made aware of this and are on high alert.”  Butler Township is about 640 miles from Lawrence, Kansas.  Police responded to a report of shots fired just before noon Friday, Porter said, and the four victims died at the scenes. “This is the first violent crime in this neighborhood in recent memory,” Porter said. “We are working to determine if there was any motive to this horrible tragedy or if mental illness played any role.”  Wendy Chapman, a neighbor of one victim, told CNN affiliate WKEF the neighborhood is a quiet place. “I would have never, even in this neighborhood, I would never expect anything, never,” Chapman told the Dayton station. Butler Township is a town of just under 8,000 residents about nine miles north of Dayton. In the neighboring city of Vandalia, authorities increased the number of officers on patrol following the shooting, Mayor Richard Herbst said in a Facebook post. The city also canceled outdoor activities and closed recreation facilities “as a precaution,” the mayor said, noting that there were no “specific threats against City facilities.”  CNN’s Zenebou Sylla, Liam Reilly and Samantha Beech also contributed to this story",Wendy Chapman;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Stephen Marlow;Zenebou Sylla;John Porter,Butler Township Police;Butler Township Police;Butler Township Police;Facebook;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1609;KILL,37;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,544;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,502;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,502;WB_840_JUSTICE,502;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,502;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,502;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,502;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,502;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1751;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE_CHIEF,257;TAX_DISEASE_MENTAL_ILLNESS,1629;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,433;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,749;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,433;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,749;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,433;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,749;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,573;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1479;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,235;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,364;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,698;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,853;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,1279;TAX_FNCACT_BUTLER,1960;GENERAL_HEALTH,1629;ARREST,125;SOC_GENERALCRIME,125;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,125;MEDIA_SOCIAL,888;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,257;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1430;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,544;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1425;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,544;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1425;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1088;TRIAL,17;TRIAL,669;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1193;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1193;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1193;SECURITY_SERVICES,134;SECURITY_SERVICES,205;SECURITY_SERVICES,251;SECURITY_SERVICES,714;SECURITY_SERVICES,869;SECURITY_SERVICES,1332;SECURITY_SERVICES,1704;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,134;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,205;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,251;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,714;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,869;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1332;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1704;TAX_FNCACT_PORTER,269;TAX_FNCACT_PORTER,1402;TAX_FNCACT_PORTER,1526;LEGISLATION,1181;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1181;",Ohio;Kansas;Dayton,533

Trump The FBI executed a search warrant on Monday at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there when he left the White House. The former President was at Trump Tower in New York when the search warrant was executed. In February, the National Archives previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from the resort – including some that were classified. Separately, photos have apparently revealed Trump’s habit of flushing key White House documents down the toilet. The extraordinary move to search the home of a former president comes as Trump’s legal problems continue on multiple fronts. Trump is also expected in the coming months to announce he will launch another bid for the White House in 2024. 2. Floods Various regions across the US are grappling with major damage caused by flooding. Yellowstone National Park flooded in mid-June, followed by torrential flooding in St. Louis and Kentucky – and then this weekend there was flooding in California’s Death Valley. That deluge resulted in numerous landslides that buried cars and cut off roads – trapping roughly a thousand people inside the park. Forecasts are showing that even more flooding is possible this week for the Southwest and portions of eastern Kentucky, where many residents are still left without power and water after the flooding earlier this month killed at least 37 people. Meanwhile, in Seoul, South Korea, at least eight people were killed on Monday due to record rainfall that flooded homes, roads and subway stations.  3. Ukraine Up to 80,000 Russians have been killed or wounded during the war in Ukraine, according to Pentagon official Colin Kahl. That number of casualties is “remarkable,” Kahl said, considering Russia has “achieved none of Vladimir Putin’s objectives” since invading Ukraine in February. On Monday, the Pentagon also announced that the US has sent anti-radar missiles to Ukraine, marking the first time the Defense Department has acknowledged sending the previously undisclosed weapons to aid Ukrainian forces. Separately, Russia has notified the US that it will temporarily suspend inspections under a key nuclear weapons treaty, which allows Russia and the US to keep a close eye on each other’s nuclear weapons. This comes as US authorities ramp up their campaign to seize valuable property from those close to the Kremlin.  4. Gas prices The average cost of a gallon of gas is down almost a dollar since the June peak, giving drivers some much-needed financial relief at the pump. But some analysts warn that low oil inventories will likely keep prices elevated. Aside from Russia’s war with Ukraine and the sanctions that have disrupted its oil exports, analysts say oil producers are showing an inability – and sometimes an unwillingness – to increase their production. Oil companies in the US are also hesitant to make big investments in extracting and refining fossil fuels as the current administration shifts further toward renewable energy. Gas prices play a major role in fighting inflation, which financial experts say will likely stick around into 2023.  5. Olivia Newton-John Olivia Newton-John, the Australian singer and actress who charmed generations of viewers in the blockbuster movie “Grease,” died on Monday, according to a statement from her husband. She was 73. The singer revealed in September 2018 that she was treating cancer at the base of her spine. It was her third cancer diagnosis, following bouts with breast cancer in the early ’90s and in 2017. Hollywood icons joined fans worldwide to mourn the loss of Newton-John, including John Travolta who played her character’s love interest in “Grease.” He shared the following emotional tribute on Instagram: “My dearest Olivia, you made all of our lives so much better. Your impact was incredible. I love you so much.”   BREAKFAST BROWSE Actor Woody Harrelson finds his look-alike. She’s a 9-month-old.

He has since resigned from his position. Last week, Gundy said one of his players was “distracted” during the film session, so the coach picked up the player’s iPad and read aloud what he saw on the tablet. “What I said was not malicious; it wasn’t even intentional,” Gundy wrote on his Twitter account Sunday. He did not disclose what the word was, but said he “accepts accountability” for the incident.

103,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/biden-second-term-joe-manchin-cnntv/,"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia refused to say Sunday whether he thinks President Joe Biden deserves a second term in office.  “I’m not getting involved in any election right now. 2022, 2024, I’m not speculating on it. President Biden is my president right now. I’m going to work with him and his administration to the best of my ability to help the people in my state of West Virginia and this country,” Manchin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” when asked whether he thinks Biden deserves to be reelected in two years.  Biden lost Manchin’s home state of West Virginia by 39 points in 2020.   Asked by NBC on Sunday if he hopes Democrats keep control of the US House and the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections, Manchin again appeared reticent, saying: “You know, I’m not making those choices or decisions on that.”  “I’m going to work with whatever I have. I’ve always said that. I think the Democrats have great candidates that are running. They’re good people I’ve worked with. And I have a tremendous amount of respect and friendship with my Republican colleagues,” he said. “So I can work on either side very easily.” The comments from Manchin, a moderate Democrat whose reluctance to support some of Biden’s domestic agenda has at times prevented the President from achieving some legislative goals, further underscore his unpredictable nature as a swing vote within the party. They also come as more and more Democrats say they want someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee in 2024.  A CNN poll released last week found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than the President in the 2024 election, a sharp increase from earlier this year. The results accompany low approval ratings for Biden amid widespread discontent with the state of the country and the economy.  An earlier CNN Poll, conducted in January and February, showed 51% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters saying they wanted someone other than Biden to be the Democratic nominee in the next presidential election. The White House said last year that Biden intends to run for reelection in 2024, following a report indicating that the commander in chief and his staff are attempting to assuage concerns about his future political prospects. Last week, Manchin handed the President a potential legislative victory after he and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal on a major energy and health care bill that represented a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again. Manchin told Tapper on Sunday that Biden deserved credit for the agreement.  “You don’t do a bill this magnitude and this size without the President knowing what’s going on, the President being involved in, to a certain extent, but also giving approval. And that’s what President Biden did,” he said. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.

421,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/kentucky-flooding-survivor-stories/,"With another flood watch in place in eastern Kentucky, people here are hoping and praying for one more miracle.  Some saw it as a miracle they survived the historic flooding more than a week ago. They might feel it could take another to survive the aftermath – the mud and debris of destroyed houses and businesses, the pain of dozens of lives lost and many missing, and the trauma of their experiences. Over the past week, across the now-declared disaster area, survivors have shared harrowing stories with CNN of barely escaping the rushing waters, incredible rescue missions, and desperate attempts to save their families and themselves.   But they also have stories of barely surviving the cruel wake once the water receded – being stranded by washed out roads and bridges, struggling to get food, medicine or water in the early days, being rescued by neighbors.  “We’re not victims here,” said Allen Bormes, police chief for the city of Fleming-Neon, where there’s little left besides debris and mud. “We’re survivors.” More than a week after the flooding, Fleming-Neon Mayor Susan Polis still cries when recalling the devastation she saw in its aftermath. “Well, I wasn’t prepared. But what can you do when your little town is, your little city is devastated? I mean, it was like a war zone,” she said. City Hall is destroyed, leaving officials this week to work out of a camper and a tent over a table set up in a parking lot. The water lines on buildings lining Main Street reach well over 6 feet.  The water and debris broke windows all along the main part of downtown, in shops, the town dental office, churches – nothing was spared. Like many other communities in the region, there isn’t any clean, running water.   “Our vision is to build this back better than it was before, before the rain,” said Bormes. With a catch in his throat, he took a moment to collect his emotions before continuing. “Because these people deserve it. They deserve to have what they had before and more.” Fleming-Neon was nearly impossible to reach in the first days after the flood, so help came from within the community. Polis recalled people being trapped in a holler until neighbors acted.  “They had a bridge to basically disintegrate. And for that night, for the rest of Thursday night and into Friday afternoon, there was no way in and no way out, for those people,” Polis said, “So, some citizens, before all this heavy equipment started coming in – the citizens, they fixed it.” Quick thinking in a close call with death Letcher Fire Chief Wallace Bolling Jr. still can’t believe he lived to tell how he survived the floods. Bolling, who people around town call Spanky, received a call that the fire station in nearby Jeremiah was flooding. He drove his pickup to the station, in part to move vehicles to avoid damage. In hindsight, he admitted the decision wasn’t good.   The water started to rise quickly as he pulled up to the station, trapping him inside his truck, which he said began floating with the current. His only option was to try to steer the truck into an old tanker he had left parked outside the station, he said.  Unable to open the truck’s door or window, “I reached and found my pistol in the back seat, and I shot the window out of my Chevy,” he said. Diving out the window, he made it to safety by climbing on top of the tanker, where he remained for 15 hours as flood waters, downed trees and debris rushed past him. “I had a lot of time to think about a lot of things,” Bolling said. “I found peace. I wasn’t scared. I had a long talk with the Lord.”  While stranded, Bolling texted his mother and father: “I love you, please don’t worry… everything is fine… I love you.” Dealing with post-traumatic stress The Letcher Fire Department was destroyed, with all vehicles damaged. Insurance won’t be enough to cover all the damages, according to Bolling. While Bolling plans to get the station straightened out, he also has to address his own trauma, he said. He hasn’t been able to sleep and often hears water when he closes his eyes. “I’m having a lot of trouble. I’m not going to lie,” he said. He plans to talk to a therapist and hopes others who survived the storm can do the same. “PTSD is real, and I kind of wondered about things, like how to go forward, but you know, I gotta fix myself first,” he said.   But along with the sorrow, there’s pride, too, in the way their Appalachian community has come together, with neighbors who lost everything helping neighbors in the same situation.  Volunteers from all over Appalachia have been sweeping and using small bulldozers to get mud out of buildings this week.  And while proud of their independent and resilient community, officials in Fleming-Neon admit the city is desperate for all the help it can get.  “Our infrastructure needs help from Washington, from Frankfort. We’re going to have to have a lot of help,” Fire Chief Bolling said. Gary Clink, who has lived just outside of Hindman for decades, was rescued, along with his wife and a neighbor, by his son-in-law, he said. Now he’s trying to save his wet furniture from mildew in the muddy interior of his home, which had more than 4 feet of water in it during the flood.  “It’s like someone turned the switch to maximum overdrive,” explained Clink as he sat on the porch looking at what was left of his belongings drying out on the lawn, “I’ve never seen water like that. It’s like a dam burst or a tsunami. “That’s the reason you see garbage wherever you look, houses wrecked. I’ve seen three homes I knew basically lifted up off the foundation base, as they washed down the stream and it ripped them apart.” And he worries that this catastrophe won’t be the last.  “I believe you’re seeing the effects of climate change right here,” Clink said. “Just given time, if we don’t turn it around, just given time, it’s going to get worse.”  Some are also concerned that people will leave the area because the devastation is too extreme. “This is literally the end of this little community,” Clink sighed, “These people, you’ll see a lot of them had decent appliances, decent furniture, decent clothes, but it is no longer decent. “If they didn’t have flood insurance or FEMA can’t step in and actually help… this is the end of the line for this community. I don’t see any way they are going to come back from it.” Bolling agreed. “It’s country back here. It’s slow. I mean, we love it. We stay back here,” Bolling said. “But at the same time, it’s never going to be the same. There will be a lot of people leave here. I know that. They have nothing to come back to.  But we’ll make it. We’re strong.”",,Cnn;Cnn,"NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,216;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,216;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,133;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,330;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,293;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,764;WB_137_WATER,575;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,63;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,69;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,404;AFFECT,389;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,498;",Letcher County;Kentucky,1499
486,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-killings-monday/,"The potentially linked ambush-style shootings of three Muslim men and the recent killing of a fourth in Albuquerque have alarmed the city’s Muslim community, leaving the community grappling with fear as police announce they have detained a suspect. The killings of Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, Aftab Hussein, 41, and Naeem Hussain, 25, all have one commonality: the victims were all Muslim and of South Asian descent, according to Albuquerque police. The three most recent killings happened within the span of two weeks, putting the city on edge as police probed for potential links between the attacks, and put a spotlight on an unsolved homicide from November 2021.  Albuquerque police announced Tuesday they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, who they described as the “primary suspect” and the driver of a dark silver sedan-style vehicle authorities previously described as a “vehicle of interest.”  The suspect is being charged with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain. The FBI is assisting with the investigation, and an online portal was set up for residents to upload videos and images which might help authorities investigating the killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has also voted to increase a reward for information leading to an arrest to $20,000. “While we are still sifting through all the evidence to look for more connections, it is deeply troubling that these three men were Muslim and of similar descent,” deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division, Kyle Hartsock, previously said. Here’s what we know about the killings and the investigation so far: How did the killings happen? The most recent of the killings was reported Friday, when Naeem Hussain was found dead by Albuquerque police officers who responded to reports of a shooting just before midnight in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue. After the discovery, Albuquerque police said the homicide “may be connected” to three previous killings of Muslim men from South Asia. Those three men – Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Mohammad Ahmadi – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Hartsock previously said. Two of them, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein, were both Pakistani men and were killed in Southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue. Police said they “determined there is a connection” between those two deaths. On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT. On July 26, police responded to Rhode Island Street where they found Aftab Hussein with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car. Detectives learned that the gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle,  the complaint states. Police found that casings from both the August 1 and July 26 shootings were likely fired from the same firearm, according to Hartsock. As investigators probed those two recent killings, they turned their attention to the November 7, 2021, homicide of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan who was killed outside a business he ran with his brother on San Mateo Boulevard. Who are the victims? Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had just become a US citizen last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami. He opened his own trucking business this year and was described as being a kind, generous and hardworking person. The day he was killed, he had attended a funeral for the two recent victims and expressed fear about the shootings, according to a spokesman with a mosque in Albuquerque. Muhammad Afzaal Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor. “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.” Few details have been released about the two other victims. Police said Mohammad Ahmadi was a Muslim man from Afghanistan and Aftab Hussein was a Muslim man from Pakistan. Where does the investigation stand? Prior to the news Tuesday that a suspect had been detained, police had only released a flyer showing a “vehicle of interest” in all four killings. But it remained unclear who the car belongs to, or how they are potentially connected to the attacks. Police said the vehicle “is suspected as being used as a conveyance in recent homicides of 4 Muslim men.”  “We have a very, very strong lead. We have a vehicle of interest … we have got to find this vehicle,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller previously said. “We don’t know at this point what it is associated with, or who owns it.” While police have not definitively said all four attacks are connected, they have said they are looking into whether it is the case. “There is one strong commonality in all the victims; the race and religion,” Hartsock said in a Thursday briefing. Authorities are asking the public to come forward with any information which might help in the investigation. Tips may be submitted to the Albuquerque Metro CrimeStoppers website. Authorities are still searching for a motive behind the killings and working to confirm whether they’re all related.  Syed is now being charged with two of the homicides – of Aftab Hussein and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – and police said there is evidence “strong enough that” authorities are continuing to view Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in the other two killings as well, Hartsock said. How are local and national leaders responding? After Friday’s killing, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday she would send additional state police to Albuquerque. “I am angered and saddened that this is happening in New Mexico, a place that prides itself on diversity of culture and thought. This is not who we are,” Grisham said in a statement. “We will not stop in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families and are bringing every resource to bear to apprehend the killer or killers – and we WILL find them.” The attacks have drew condemnation from President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.  Meanwhile, local and national Muslim groups had warned residents to be cautious. “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” Islamic Center of New Mexico posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” The center said while there was no evidence its mosque is being targeted, it was still taking steps to provide additional security measures. “The lives of Albuquerque Muslims are in danger. Whoever is responsible for this horrific, hateful shooting spree must be identified and stopped – now,” stressed Council on American-Islamic Relations National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell. The Council was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible, the organization announced, calling the series of killings a “horrific, hateful shooting spree.” CNN’s Claudia Dominguez and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",Edward Ahmed Mitchell;Albuquerque Metro Crimestoppers;Michelle Lujan Grisham;Ehsan Shahalami;Joe Biden;Aftab

Mastriano’s attorney cut off the virtual appearance soon after it began, the source said. His lawyer, Tim Parlatore, took issue with several procedural matters related to the deposition, and raised questions about the legality of the subpoena that Mastriano received from the panel, the source added.   “We were there for 15 minutes. It was clear that the committee was unable to comply with the regulations regarding use of deposition authority and moreover has no interest in complying with the regulations,” Parlatore said. “We’re happy to provide the information if they can either do it fairly and legally or if we can reach a resolution on how to do a voluntary interview which minimizes the risk of election interference.”  Mastriano is the GOP gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania, and was a central player supporting former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Mastriano was also among the mob of Trump supporters on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, during the insurrection, though he didn’t go into the Capitol itself and hasn’t been charged with any crimes. CNN previously reported that Mastriano’s appearance was expected to be brief and unproductive because Mastriano’s camp and the committee were at an impasse over issues like whether Mastriano could independently videotape or record his appearance. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment about Mastriano’s appearance.",Doug Mastriano;Donald Trump;Tim Parlatore;Mike Pompeo;Mike Pompeo,Cnn;Cnn,"ELECTION,1034;ELECTION,1209;",Pennsylvania,327
74,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/lgbtq-drag-queen-far-right-protests-intl/,"An ordinary red-brick library in the southern English town of Reading is an unlikely backdrop for the latest front in the battle for equality for the LGBTQ+ community. But last week – in scenes later repeated across the country– Covid-19 conspiracists and far-right supporters lobbed homophobic and transphobic slurs at parents and children to try to stop the kids from meeting drag queens.  In footage shared online, anti-vaxxer Michael Chaves ​is seen berating parents – some of whom are carrying infants – arriving for Drag Queen Story Hour UK, an event at which books promoting compassion and inclusion are read to children. Chaves goes on to falsely accuse Sab Samuel, who was performing that day as drag queen Aida H Dee, of being a pedophile. CNN has reached out to Chaves for comment; he has not responded. ​ He told local newspaper The Reading Chronicle, that he was protesting the tour as it was “sexualising children.”  As protesters unfurled a banner reading: “Welcome groomers” outside the library, two women who had pretended to be attendees disrupted the reading inside the building, calling Samuel an “adult entertainer” as they terrified parents and children in the process, according to Samuel. At least one mother was seen crying after the incident, Samuel said.  The term “groomer” is a homophobic stereotype used to falsely smear queer people and their supporters as child sex abusers.  At the end of the session, Samuel left the library with police protection as demonstrators hurled abuse.  ​Recent angry confrontations around events involving drag queens in the United Kingdom follow a disturbing precedent from the United States, where right-wing extremist groups ambush similar events and conservative politicians have pledged to criminalize adults taking children to drag shows.  It has coincided with a wider movement to curtail rights ​related to bodily autonomy, ranging from abortion access to gender affirming care​, punctuated by a wave of anti-LGBTQ bills and Justice Clarence Thomas questioning marriage equality as the US Supreme Court overturned the ​federal right to abortion ​in the United States. “This is the same hate (as seen in the US) but just in a different context … the same disgust, the same homophobia and transphobia,” Samuel, who founded Drag Queen Story Hour UK, told CNN.  Extremist groups in Britain are now feeling emboldened amid “a broader pushback against (queer) identities existing in public,” according to Tim Squirrell, an online extremism expert and communications director at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) think tank.  “Even people who are reasonably progressive in their beliefs and politics have become quite radical ​[in their opposition to] this thing, which really, really worries me, not least to the actual risk of queer people existing in public, but in the US, we’ve seen it tied into a much broader attempt to rollback LGBT rights,” he told CNN.   The pushback against LGBTQ rights in the UK has largely affected trans people, say campaigners, where ​so-called gender critical activists and ​sympathetic British press have succeeded in curtailing efforts to make it easier for trans people to change their gender marker.  Britain’s Conservative leadership contest has seen hopefuls ​espousing anti-trans rhetoric, and promising policies that would impede on the rights of trans people.​ Trans people may potentially be left out of plans for a ban on conversion therapy ​in the UK, while some religious and ​other anti-trans groups campaign against the teaching of ​what they call “gender ​ideology,” or information about the existence of transgender and nonbinary identities, in school.   Drag queens have also been ​a target of some feminists, who criticize them for what they perceive as a mocking portrayal of women and for being over-sexualized.  Challenging expectations Drag culture has long centered around LGBTQ people, challenging traditional expectations and beliefs ​about the ways people of all genders and sexual orientations express themselves.  Samuel said this was what had inspired him to quit his job in marketing and start Drag Queen Story Hour UK three years ago. He said he wanted to provide kids with diverse role models, which he did not have growing up. But ​he says the death threats soon followed, and Samuel said that in 2020 he and his boyfriend moved homes because anti-LGBTQ trolls “found out where I lived.”   He said last week’s incident has pushed him to the brink. Speaking to CNN, Samuel vociferously denied accusations that children attending his shows are exposed to sexual language. What he does is a public good, he said.  ​Samuel, who is autistic and has ADHD, gave an example from the event in Reading of why he sees the story hours as so important. “Some autistic children and their parents had come specifically to see me because they knew I was autistic,” he said. When some of the young attendees realized that his drag queen persona, Aida H Dee, was a play on ADHD, a condition they also had, their faces lit up, he said.  “I could see the sparks in the synapses of their brain firing with joy… (they were thinking) that this person was amazing and like me,” he continued.   Yet as anti-drag queen protests ramp up, analysts are increasingly concerned about the hateful extremist discourse surrounding them.  Monday’s protest in Reading included anti-vaxxer Chaves as well as members of the anti-government, sovereign citizen group Alpha Men Assemble, said Joe Ondrak, head of investigations at threat intelligence organization Logically.  The term sovereign citizens emerged from the US, according to Hope Not Hate. It is based on a belief that government institutions are fraudulent, so followers do not have to abide by them. The FBI has noted that sovereign citizens operate in loosely affiliated networks without established leadership. Alpha Men Assemble is described by anti-extremist advocacy group Hope Not Hate as “attempting to establish a hardcore of activists and has attracted the involvement of a number of far-right individuals.”   The group received a lot of media attention in recent months over fears it was evolving into a US-style private militia by its alleged recruitment of former veterans and military training sessions. CNN has been unable to reach the group for comment as it has gone to ground following media and governmental scrutiny.  Ondrak is concerned that conspiracy groups, which gained large followings during the pandemic, are now pivoting towards LGBTQ targets using “groomer” narratives. “I genuinely thought what would be happening next (is) some kind of opposition towards the green energy transition, but that kind of fell out of the public discourse – so unfortunately, the queer community has become their target,” he said.  CNN has seen at least four anti-vax Telegram channels, including one boasting more than 17,000 followers, sharing flyers and posts to protest against Drag Queen Story Hour.  When asked why groups that appear to facilitate hate speech are allowed to operate on their platform, a Telegram spokesperson said: “Telegram is a platform for free speech where people are welcome to peacefully express their opinions, including those we do not agree with.” The spokesperson added that “posts that glorify or encourage violence or its perpetrators are explicitly forbidden by Telegram’s terms of service and are removed by our moderators.” As to the White nationalist groups attending the protests, such as Patriotic Alternative, Squirrell from ISD described them as “deeply homophobic.” ​ They believe that “White people are being systematically replaced by non-White people in Western countries,” he said. They say a “shadowy cabal of Jews” are encouraging White people to adopt queer identities as a way of reducing the White birth rate – views rooted in neo-Nazi ideology – Squirrell added. In response to CNN’s request for comment, a spokeswoman for Patriotic Alternative said: “Drag queens are often highly sexualized caricatures of women and we believe that children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood and should not be subjected to LGBT indoctrination.” Two days after the events in Reading, in the northern English town of Crewe, members of Patriotic Alternative picketed a library which was hosting a Drag Queen Story Hour UK event. The group’s leader ​later promised more demonstrations against Samuel’s summer tour of dozens of libraries across the country.  The protests continued last Thursday, when ​Samuel visited libraries in Bristol, a city in southwestern England known for its liberal attitudes.  Rosie, a local parent who asked CNN not to use her last name ​out of fear for her safety, told CNN she decided to take her young daughter to the event because she thought it was important to learn about inclusivity and different communities.  “I love drag queens, I think it is fun, it is art, it is a laugh, and something different that involves books and stories,” she said.  But Rosie said she was unprepared for the vitriol she encountered at the library, where protesters waved signs reading “Stop grooming children” and a line of police officers ushered parents into the building. At least one mother was crying inside as protesters played the theme song to British TV show “Jim’ll Fix It,” whose late host was a notorious ​child sexual abuser, on loudspeakers outside the library.  “It was just horrible. I was expecting it to be a joyous thing, considering it had been Pride a couple of weeks ago in Bristol.” Instead, she said the harassment by protesters was “very backwards and (I feel) naive to think there’s been any progress.”​​",Tim Squirrell;Aida H Dee;Aida H Dee;Aida H Dee;Aida H Dee;Sab Samuel;Joe Ondrak;Michael Chaves;Justice Clarence Thomas,Us Supreme Court;Institute For Strategic Dialogue;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_GROOMER,1336;TAX_FNCACT_GROOMER,7355;TERROR,1736;TERROR,2581;TERROR,5975;LGBT,314;LGBT,1352;LGBT,8366;DISCRIMINATION,314;DISCRIMINATION,1352;DISCRIMINATION,8366;DISCRIMINATION_LGBT_HOMOPHOBIC,314;DISCRIMINATION_LGBT_HOMOPHOBIC,1352;DISCRIMINATION_LGBT_HOMOPHOBIC,8366;LEADER,1792;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIANS,1792;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,6264;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,6469;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZEN,6119;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,4949;DISCRIMINATION_LGBT_HOMOPHOBIA,2483;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2483;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,260;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_SPEECH,7107;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_SPEECH,7182;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_SPEECH,7830;IDEOLOGY,2896;IDEOLOGY,4613;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,296;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,1417;HARASSMENT,10408;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,9989;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,9151;RECRUITMENT,6885;VANDALIZE,7090;VANDALIZE,7165;REBELLION,6099;SECURITY_SERVICES,1517;SECURITY_SERVICES,9980;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1517;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,9980;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1517;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,9980;TAX_FNCACT_ACTIVISTS,3315;TAX_FNCACT_ACTIVISTS,6671;HATE_SPEECH,334;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6354;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6354;TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,79;TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,9002;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,79;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,9002;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,2778;TAX_DISEASE_ADHD,5348;TAX_DISEASE_ADHD,5659;MEDIA_MSM,882;TAX_FNCACT_ENTERTAINER,1174;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,9714;RELIGION,3768;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1060;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,4108;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,8825;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,2049;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,7943;FREESPEECH,7943;EXTREMISM,285;EXTREMISM,6727;ENV_GREEN,7470;RAPE,10190;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,6197;BAN,3693;TAX_FNCACT_FEMINISTS,4032;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3305;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1136;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,10023;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1426;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,10176;TAX_FNCACT_QUEENS,405;TAX_FNCACT_QUEENS,1633;TAX_FNCACT_QUEENS,3982;TAX_FNCACT_QUEENS,8776;TAX_FNCACT_QUEENS,9704;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,6904;TAX_RELIGION_JEWS,8526;PROTEST,929;EDUCATION,3831;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,6187;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,6187;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,6187;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,6187;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,6187;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,5920;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2219;WB_840_JUSTICE,2219;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,9516;TAX_FNCACT_CAMPAIGNERS,3264;TAX_FNCACT_DEMONSTRATORS,1545;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,6775;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,7026;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,6775;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,7026;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,6775;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,7026;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,6858;WB_2448_MILITIA,6858;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,6858;WB_2445_NON_STATE_SECURITY_ACTORS,6858;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,7897;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,8061;USPEC_POLICY1,3574;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,552;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,747;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,2531;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,4214;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,4388;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,4793;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,5617;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,5892;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,7756;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,9101;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,4949;GENERAL_HEALTH,7300;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,7300;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,7300;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,7300;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,7300;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,7300;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,7300;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,7300;WB_615_GENDER,2143;WB_615_GENDER,3296;WB_615_GENDER,3446;WB_615_GENDER,3864;AFFECT,3233;ARMEDCONFLICT,154;TAX_FNCACT_ROLE_MODELS,4885;TAX_FNCACT_MODERATORS,8217;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESWOMAN,8731;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2907;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,356;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,658;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,969;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1211;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1843;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,5209;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,5463;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,8852;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,9961;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,8112;",London;Britain;Illinois;Seoul;United States;Bristol;United Kingdom;British,1945
115,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/republicans-midterm-elections-generic-ballot/,"Sometimes polling trends meet your expectations. For example, you might expect a president’s approval rating to be low when we’re dealing with high inflation and negative growth in real disposable income per capita. Sometimes, however, trends in public opinion are surprising. Even as President Joe Biden’s approval rating languishes south of 40%, Democrats aren’t just holding their own on the generic congressional ballot. They’re actually improving their position as Biden’s standing, if anything, gets worse.  It’s with this odd phenomenon that we start our look at the political week that was.  Biden’s unpopular, but so are Republicans  Republicans now hold an average advantage of less than a point on the generic congressional ballot, which usually asks respondents some form of the following question: “If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican party?” Republicans were ahead on this metric by 3 to 4 points in May.  Our CNN/SSRS poll published a little less than two weeks ago was one of several recent surveys that have reflected this tightening. Republicans were ahead by an average of 4 points in the two polls CNN released in May that included this question. The two parties were tied in the poll released this month.  When we examine this latest CNN poll more closely, we get a very good idea of why Democrats are even with Republicans on the generic ballot.  It’s because Republicans are also unpopular. There are a lot of voters who don’t like either  Biden or the GOP.  Biden’s favorable rating in the poll was just 38% among those who were asked the generic ballot question. His unfavorable rating stood at 55%. Biden’s net favorability was -17 points.  The Republican Party’s standing wasn’t really any better. Only 35% rated the party favorably. A plurality (50%) had an unfavorable view. The GOP’s net favorability was -15 points.  It turns out that 33% of the electorate holds a favorable view of Republicans and does not have a favorable view of Biden. The Republicans are winning this group on the generic ballot, 96% to 2%.  Likewise, 36% of the electorate holds a favorable view of Biden and doesn’t have a favorable view of Republicans. Democrats are crushing among this group on the generic ballot, 94% to 1%.  The other big chunk of the electorate (29%) is made up of those who like neither Biden nor the Republicans. These voters are more divided in their generic ballot preferences, with Republicans at 42% and Democrats at 35%.   Because there are slightly more people who like Biden than those who like the GOP and since the group that doesn’t like either has relatively close preferences on the generic ballot, the race overall remains tight.        The question is whether the current polling can possibly hold through Election Day. Midterms are usually a referendum on the president’s party. Anger at the president’s party could be what ultimately sways voters.   On the other hand, the current polling is, in some ways, reminiscent of what occurred during the 2016 presidential election. Nearly 20% of the electorate did not look favorably on both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump won this group by nearly 20 points and, with them, the election.  When you look at the voters who are backing Democratic congressional candidates but don’t like Biden, the current numbers actually make a lot of sense.  These voters overwhelmingly lean Democratic (85%) when asked about their party identification. They’re also overwhelmingly young (79% are under the age of 50).  The latter of which is consistent with something I noticed earlier this cycle. Biden’s favorable rating among those under 50 is shockingly low (32%) given that younger voters are usually part of the Democratic base.  Yet, these same voters are going 48% to 39% for Democrats on the generic ballot.  The bottom line is Republicans may not be able to count on voters defaulting to them. Put another way, Democrats may not be able to win this upcoming midterm. Republicans, though, could definitely lose it.  January 6 hearings may have hurt Trump Another related reason Republicans may be hurting in the polls has to do with what has been in the news. Mainly, the former President has been in the news a lot lately. Republicans have generally been better off without him in the news, and the same is true for Trump himself.  It turns out that he’s been getting more unpopular of late.  His net favorability rating stands south of -15 points in an average of recent polls. That’s the worst it’s been in over a year. Trump’s net favorability rating has shrunk every month since March. That drop has been most dramatic this past month, when he was most in the news.  Trump’s net favorability is now lower than his average net approval rating during his time in office.  Something clearly has changed, and one obvious culprit is the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The lead-up to and the public airing of the panel’s hearings track closely with Trump’s favorability decline.  Likewise, we’ve seen the US Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade with the help of justices nominated by Trump. This has proved to be an unpopular decision and has been in the news a lot.  But it isn’t only with the general electorate that Trump may be having some weakness. He’s not doing nearly as well with Republicans either.   Our CNN/SSRS poll out last week showed that 55% of Republicans now prefer a candidate other than Trump to be their 2024 nominee. It was 49% at the beginning of the year.  We’ve seen a number of state polls come out in which Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis is coming on strong. He was basically even with Trump in a University of New Hampshire poll of Granite State Republican primary voters earlier this summer.  Nationally, Trump’s numbers in the horserace polling against named candidates in a potential 2024 Republican primary has stayed fairly steady at around 50%. DeSantis, though, has doubled his support from last year and has been in the mid-20s in July polling.  Many Republican presidential primaries, unlike Democratic ones, are not decided proportionally – i.e, a GOP winner could need only a plurality of the vote to win almost all, if not all, the state delegates. Trump would prefer to face a divided field like he did in 2016.  It may not happen. Republican voters may be seeing Trump attract all this negative attention and wonder whether it is worth hitching a ride again to his electoral wagon.  For your brief encounters: School is beginning again  Readers in my neck of the woods (the New York City metropolitan area) don’t have to worry about children going back to school yet.  Some students, though, are already heading back. A family member, for example, lives down in Huntsville, Alabama, where public schools reopen this week.  Indeed, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center study, most schools in Alabama and the states surrounding it should be back in session within the next few weeks. Quite the contrast with New York and its neighboring states, where school won’t begin for most students until after Labor Day.  Leftover data Age matters for environmental concerns: A new Gallup study shows that Republicans (32%) and independents (60%) under the age of 35 are about 20 points more likely to worry a great deal about the quality of the environment than members of those same groups who were 55 or older (14% and 40% respectively). Democrats’ worry about the environment was consistent among all age groups at 64%.  Home births rose in 2020: This one may not be too surprising. The number of babies born at home climbed to 46,000 in 2020 thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. A Pew Research Center study of data from the National Center for Health Statistics showed that in the five years prior the number of home births was consistently at just below 39,000 in a given year.  Multigenerational homes become more common: Today, 18% of Americans live in a household comprising two or more generations of adults. This is up from 7% 50 years ago, according to a Pew analysis of Current Population Survey data. Americans aged 25-34 were most likely adults to live in multigenerational homes (25%), especially those with less than a college education (31%).

407,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/us-army-tactical-bra/,"The US Army is developing a tactical bra for its female soldiers. The bra, known as the Army Tactical Brassiere, is still in development at the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Solider Center, also known as DEVCOM, in Natick, Massachusetts. If approved by the Army Uniform Board, it will be the first official uniform bra the Army has offered its female soldiers in its history. The Army Times was first to report the US Army is developing this bra. Soldier Center’s Design, Pattern and Prototype Team will present final concepts and designs for the bra to the Army Uniform Board in the fall of 2022, David Accetta, US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Soldier Center spokesperson told CNN. If the Army Uniform Board approves the prototype and makes it a Program of Record, it will be added to the US Army uniform. In order to develop the bra, DEVCOM surveyed “hundreds of female soldiers across the Army in different places and in different jobs,” to gather information about the “proper fit, function, support and performance,” Accetta said. Prototypes were developed at DEVCOM’s headquarters in Natick, MA. Possible design concepts from industry partners were also evaluated at DEVCOM’s headquarters. Because the bra is considered a tactical piece not just a sportswear item, thorough tests were conducted in developing the current prototype, including flame testing at DEVCOM’s Thermal Test Facility. Findings from these tests will be presented by the development team when the bra is presented to the Army Uniform Board later this year. If the bra “becomes an official Program of Record as a result of the upcoming Army Uniform Board, we would see that as a win for female soldiers across the Army, who would then likely be issued the ATB upon initial entry to the Army,” Accetta said.",David Accetta,Program Of Record;Program Of Record;Cnn;Cnn;Army Uniform Board;Army Uniform Board;Army Uniform Board;Army Uniform Board;Army Uniform Board;Army Tactical Brassiere;Us Space;Us Space;Prototype Team;Soldier Center Design;Us Army;Us Army;Us Army;Us Army;Us Army;Army Times,"SOC_EMERGINGTECH,469;SOC_EMERGINGTECH,515;SOC_EMERGINGTECH,1205;WB_742_YOUTH_AND_GENDER_BASED_VIOLENCE,69;WB_742_YOUTH_AND_GENDER_BASED_VIOLENCE,405;WB_742_YOUTH_AND_GENDER_BASED_VIOLENCE,1983;WB_2437_FEMALE_COMBATANTS,69;WB_2437_FEMALE_COMBATANTS,405;WB_2437_FEMALE_COMBATANTS,1983;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,69;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,405;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,1983;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,69;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,405;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,1983;MILITARY,16;MILITARY,100;MILITARY,160;MILITARY,306;MILITARY,373;MILITARY,526;MILITARY,564;MILITARY,701;MILITARY,758;MILITARY,850;MILITARY,952;MILITARY,1056;MILITARY,1805;MILITARY,1920;MILITARY,1999;MILITARY,2072;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_NATICK,250;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_NATICK,1253;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MASSACHUSETTS,281;TAX_FNCACT_PILOT,1432;TAX_FNCACT_PILOT,1496;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIER,598;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIER,806;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIER,598;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIER,806;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1313;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,826;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HEADQUARTERS,1243;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HEADQUARTERS,1365;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIERS,69;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIERS,405;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIERS,1040;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIERS,1983;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIERS,69;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIERS,405;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIERS,1040;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIERS,1983;ARMEDCONFLICT,167;ARMEDCONFLICT,765;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,352;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1869;WB_2670_JOBS,1096;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,1096;WB_470_EDUCATION,1096;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,1096;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,1096;",Natick;Massachusetts,365
666,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/media/axios-cox-enterprises/,"Axios, the buzzy digital media venture founded in in 2017, will sell itself to Cox Enterprises, the two companies announced on Monday. The deal, which is expected to close this month, values Axios at $525 million, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Axios is known for delivering news in brief stories that are comprised of bite-sized pieces of information. The publication is also known for its popular newsletters that often drive the national conversation, especially in Washington, DC. News of the deal was first reported by The New York Times. Cox Enterprises, which was already a top investor in Axios, said that Axios co-founders Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz will continue to lead the outlet’s day-to-day editorial and business decisions. VandeHei, Allen, and Schwartz will also continue to hold “substantial stakes in the company,” Cox Enterprises said. While the three co-founders will remain on the board, Cox Enterprises will control it with four board seats. “We have found our kindred spirit for creating a great, trusted, consequential media company that can outlast us all,” VandeHei said. “Our shared ambitions should be clear: to spread clinical, nonpartisan, trusted journalism to as many cities and as many topics as fast as possible.” Cox Enterprises chief executive Alex Taylor praised Axios as a “forward-thinking organization.” Taylor said Cox Enterprises looks forward “to helping them continue to scale and grow.” “With so much happening in the world, Axios plays a critical role in delivering balanced, trusted news that people need,” Taylor said. “Our company started in the media business, and we have always had a passion for journalism. Cox Enterprises said that its other media companies, such as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Dayton Daily News, will not be impacted by the deal. Axios HQ, the company’s software arm, will not be sold to Cox Enterprises as part of the transaction. It will instead be spun off into a separate company led by VandeHei as chairman and Schwartz as chief executive. “We are excited about entering into this new chapter with Cox and the opportunities we can explore with Axios HQ as a separate business,” Schwartz said. “For both companies, our mission is to help as many people and companies get smarter, faster on what matters.”",,Cox Enterprises,"EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,53;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,53;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,53;",New York,470

53,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/nebraska-laurel-fires-deaths/,"The suspect in a quadruple homicide in which the victims were found dead in two separate house fires has been hospitalized with burns over much of his body and lived across the street from one of the blazes, police in Nebraska said Friday. According to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KTIV, a gas station receipt left in a backpack at one of the murder scenes led authorities to Jason A. Jones, 42. He was taken into custody early Friday, Nebraska State Police Col. John Bolduc said. Jones had serious burns and was airlifted to a hospital in Lincoln, Bolduc said. Jones is charged with four counts of first-degree murder, four counts of use of a firearm to commit a felony and two counts of first-degree arson, according to the documents.   It could not immediately be determined whether he had legal representation. Crime scene investigators obtained physical evidence at the two fire scenes that pointed to a suspect who lived right across the street from one of the fires. Bolduc credited firefighters for putting out the fires while preserving the evidence of the crimes, which led police to the suspect. Bolduc said it was premature to talk about motive. “I want to acknowledge the indescribable grief that this community is experiencing right now. And that’s going to be compounded by the betrayal of trust that they’re going to feel because a community member here is alleged to have committed these crimes,” Bolduc said. According to the affidavit and application for the issuance of an arrest warrant, a black backpack was located inside a home on 209 Elm Street where an explosion was reported, and a woman “who appears to have suffered two gunshot wounds” was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead on the scene.  “Upon execution of the search warrant, located in the kitchen was a black backpack,” the document read. “In the black backpack was several receipts.” One receipt dated August 3 led investigators to a gas station where Jones allegedly used a credit card to purchase a 6-gallon auto shutoff gas, a fuel tank, and a camping backpack, according to the document.  Security cameras also allegedly showed Jones at a mini mart “pumping gas into two red gas cans.” In the second home on 503 Elm Street, where three individuals were found deceased with gunshot wounds, a “Molotov cocktail was found indicating the fire to have been intentional.” When executing a search warrant in that home, authorities found a pistol that was traced showing it was purchased by Jason Alan Jones of “206 Elm Street.”  The four victims have been identified as a family of three adults, 85-year-old Janet Twiford, 86-year-old Gene Twiford, and 55-year-old Dana Twiford; and the woman who was found in the first house, 53-year-old Michele Ebeling.  James Roberts, who has owned Laurel’s Hometown Market for more than a year, said that news of the deaths had shocked the small town. Laurel has a population of around 1,000 people and is located in Cedar County in the northeast of the state. “Stuff like this doesn’t happen in this town,” Roberts said. “Everybody here knows everybody.” He said the grocery store has delivered food to the state troopers and firefighters who responded to the scene and are stationed at a nearby church. Staff packed up hamburgers and sandwiches including sloppy joes in addition to some water to show their support.   “It’s a tight-knit town,” Roberts said. “Everybody here is family.”",John Bolduc,Cnn,"WB_168_ROADS_AND_HIGHWAYS,1086;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1086;WB_1809_HIGHWAYS,1086;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1086;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,246;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1052;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1173;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,680;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,417;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,758;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1246;WB_2937_SILVER,981;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,981;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,981;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,981;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,949;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1654;WB_840_JUSTICE,949;WB_840_JUSTICE,1654;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,949;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1654;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,949;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1654;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,949;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1654;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,949;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1654;SECURITY_SERVICES,504;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,504;DISASTER_FIRE,661;TRIAL,832;WB_1428_INJURY,1442;WB_1406_DISEASES,1442;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1442;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,1442;KILL,29;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,29;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,29;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,29;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,146;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,524;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1500;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,146;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,524;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1500;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1710;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1710;LEGISLATION,937;LEGISLATION,1642;EPU_POLICY_LAW,937;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1642;",Cedar County;Nebraska,711
151,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/russian-bitcoin-extradited-us/,"A Russian national accused of running a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly profited from various hacking and extortion schemes has been extradited from Greece and is on his way to the US, according to the suspect’s lawyer. Alexander Vinnik, who is in his early 40s, is accused of operating a cryptocurrency exchange known as BTC-e that allegedly did business with ransomware gangs, drug dealers and identity thieves, according to the Justice Department. He faces charges in the US Northern District Court of California of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money service business in the US, among other charges. Vinnik’s extradition is a significant win for US law enforcement officials, who had been in a high-stakes extradition fight with Russia to gain custody of Vinnik.  Frédéric Bélot, Vinnik’s lawyer in France, told CNN Thursday afternoon that his client was on a plane from Athens, Greece, to the US, where he is expected to make an initial court appearance in the US Northern District of California. Bélot said that Vinnik maintains his innocence.  Vinnik’s extradition shows how US prosecutors have continued to pursue high-profile Russian cybercrime suspects at a time when any faint hopes of cooperation with Moscow on the issue have dimmed.   Vinnik was arrested in 2017 in Greece and subsequently extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for money laundering. But Vinnik has also been under indictment in US since 2017, and the US and Russia filed dueling extradition requests from Greece. BTC-e, which shut down in 2017, received more than $4 billion worth of bitcoin while it was operating, according to the Justice Department.  The Treasury Department in 2017 assessed a $110 million civil money penalty against the cryptocurrency exchange “for willfully violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws” and a $12 million fee against Vinnik.",Alexander Vinnik,Us Northern District Court;Treasury Department;Justice Department;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn,"WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,468;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1730;WB_840_JUSTICE,468;WB_840_JUSTICE,1730;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,783;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1320;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1560;CORRUPTION,565;CORRUPTION,1485;ECON_MONEYLAUNDERING,565;ECON_MONEYLAUNDERING,1485;WB_2076_MONEY_LAUNDERING,565;WB_2076_MONEY_LAUNDERING,1485;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,565;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1485;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,565;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1485;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,244;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,861;CRIME_COMMON_ROBBERY,441;TAX_FNCACT_THIEVES,441;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1368;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1368;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,1459;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1459;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1459;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1459;ECON_BITCOIN,78;ECON_BITCOIN,333;ECON_BITCOIN,1841;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,1757;WB_1045_TREASURY,1757;ECON_IDENTITYTHEFT,441;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,385;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,614;CYBER_ATTACK,132;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,712;DRUG_TRADE,414;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,414;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,414;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,414;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,414;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,414;ORGANIZED_CRIME,407;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,407;WB_2452_GANGS,407;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,407;WB_2445_NON_STATE_SECURITY_ACTORS,407;ARREST,799;TRIAL,34;TRIAL,306;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,14;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1234;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,14;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1234;SECURITY_SERVICES,712;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,712;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,712;LEGISLATION,700;EPU_POLICY_LAW,700;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,722;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,1189;",Russian;Athens;France;Russia;Moscow;Greece;California,400
403,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/entertainment/kevin-spacey-31-million-house-of-cards-production-company/,"Kevin Spacey will have to pay almost $31 million to Media Rights Capital, the production company behind “House of Cards,” a judge has ruled. The actor starred in the Netflix series for five seasons before he was fired in 2017. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mel Red Recana made the ruling earlier this week, confirming an award that had been decided by an arbitrator last year. CNN has obtained the court documents. Spacey and MRC have been battling in the years since the actor was dismissed from the production over allegations of misconduct on and off the set. Spacey starred as Frank Underwood on the Emmy-winning show, and MRC claims that having to cut him out of the sixth season of the show cost them millions of dollars and “rendered him (and his affiliated entities) liable.” Spacey was fired from the TV show the day after CNN published its report in 2017, in which several current and former members of the “House of Cards” production staff came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. One person also accused Spacey, who was an executive producer on the series, of sexual assault. Shortly before CNN’s report, actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed News that the actor made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986 when he was 14 years old. MRC says it halted the production “to address any concerns of the show’s cast and crew” in wake of the allegations, according to a 2021 filing and previously reported by CNN. Following Rapp’s claims, Spacey issued a statement claiming he did not recall the incident and apologized for what he said would have been “deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.” The Oscar winner is facing a criminal trial in London next year after being accused of sexually assaulting three men between 2005 and 2013.

651,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/05/europe/griner-russia-prisoner-swap-lavrov-intl-hnk/,"The US and Russia have indicated they are ready to hold talks over a prisoner swap, a day after basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of drug smuggling and sentenced to nine years in prison for carrying less than a gram of cannabis oil through a Moscow airport. Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Cambodia that the Kremlin is “ready to discuss this topic, but within the framework of the channel that has been agreed by the presidents,” state news agency RIA Novosti reported. “There is a specified channel that has been agreed upon by [Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden], and no matter what anyone says publicly, this channel will remain in effect,” Lavrov reportedly said Friday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. Shortly later, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the same summit that the US will “pursue” talks with Russia. “We put forward, as you know, a substantial proposal that Russia should engage with us on. And what Foreign Minister Lavrov said this morning and said publicly is that they are prepared to engage through channels we’ve established to do just that. And we’ll be pursuing that,” Blinken told reporters at a press briefing. President Joe Biden said later on Friday that he’s hopeful about efforts to secure Griner. “I’m hopeful. We’re working hard,” Biden told reporters outside the White House after a bill signing. The comments from each side suggest that a negotiation process, which has already proven complex, could accelerate in the coming days. Russian government officials requested last month that a former colonel from the country’s domestic spy agency, who was convicted of murder in Germany last year, be included in the US’ proposed swap of notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout for Griner and Paul Whelan, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Whelan, a US citizen, has been held by Russia since 2018 and was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 on espionage charges that he has strenuously denied. Griner’s conviction has raised similar concerns that she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine. The US State Department classifies the pair as wrongfully detained. Griner, a Women’s National Basketball Association star, pleaded guilty to carrying cannabis oil in her luggage as she traveled through a Moscow airport on February 17. She testified in court that she was aware of Russia’s strict drug laws and had no intention of bringing cannabis into the country, saying she was in a rush and “stress packing.” Prior to the verdict on Thursday, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech. “I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” she said.  “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom,” she continued. Griner’s lawyers had hoped that her guilty plea and statements of remorse would result in a more lenient sentence. Her conviction, Blinken told reporters, “puts a spotlight on [Washington’s] very significant concern with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda using individuals as political pawn.” “The same goes for Paul Whelan,” Blinken added. Earlier Friday, a US State Department official told reporters there had been no “serious response” from Russia on a proposed swap. The same official said Blinken and Lavrov had not met while at the Cambodia summit, and that Blinken had no plans to do so. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Russia would not discuss the prospect of a transfer publicly. “If we discuss through the press some exchange-related nuances, then these exchanges will never take place. The Americans have already made this mistake,” he said Friday. Peskov, asked whether Putin could pardon Griner, said that “there is a certain [legal] procedure that the convicted can resort to, in accordance with the law.” According to the Russian law, to start the clemency procedure, a convict needs to write a petition to the Russian president.   Before the start of Thursday’s WNBA game between Griner’s Phoenix Mercury and the Connecticut Sun, members of both teams linked arms around center court, and a 42-second moment of silence was held for Brittney Griner. Near the end of those 42 seconds, members of the crowd started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” This story has been updated with additional developments.

207,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/joe-manchin-energy-health-care-bill-cnntv/,"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin argued Sunday that Republicans would in “normal times” support an energy and health care bill he recently negotiated with leaders of his party, saying the major piece of legislation addresses key areas the GOP has long championed. “I think it’s a great piece of legislation and on normal times, my Republican colleagues would be for something such as this. We’ve basically paid down debt, (which) is what they want. We’ve accelerated permitting, which is what they want. And we’ve increased production of energy, which is what they want. We’ve done things that we should be doing together,” Manchin, who represents West Virginia, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” Manchin said the bill he negotiated with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is not “inflammatory” despite some reports promoted by Republicans that show it could add to inflation and raise taxes.  “Well, we found that they were wrong. And people can be wrong, but how in the world can it be inflammatory?” Manchin told Tapper. “How can it add flames to inflation fires right now if you’re paying down debt?” He added: “We’re doing everything we can to make sure we attack the problem. And these are solutions to the problems we have. So I know the ones playing politics with it.” When Manchin and Schumer, a New York Democrat, announced the deal last week, it represented a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again. Though many details have not been disclosed, the measure would invest $369 billion into energy and climate change programs, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, according to a one-page fact sheet. It would also address the permitting of energy infrastructure, which could ease the path for a shale gas pipeline in West Virginia. Manchin on Sunday was asked about getting fellow moderate Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s support for the legislation. “Sen. Sinema is my dear friend. We work very close together on so many things, and she has so much in this piece of legislation. She’s formed quite a bit of and worked on it very hard. And with that, she’s brought down drug prices, she’s been very instrumental in letting Medicare go ahead and negotiate for lower drug prices,” Manchin said of the Arizona senator. He added: “I think that basically when she looks at the bill and sees the whole spectrum of what we’re doing … hopefully she will be positive about it, but she’ll make her decision and I respect that.” Manchin also defended a provision in the bill that would impose a 15% minimum tax on certain corporations. “People should be paying their fair share, especially the largest corporations in America that have a billion dollars of value or greater. Can’t they pay at least 15%, so that we can move forward and be the leader of the world and the superpower that we are?” he told Tapper, adding that the bill “was not putting a burden on any taxpayers whatsoever.” Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee on Saturday released data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that showed that Americans of all incomes would see their federal taxes rise under the climate and health care package. That analysis, however, looked at the indirect effect of the 15% minimum tax provision on corporations. Economists assume companies would then pass along part of their tax increase to employees by reducing their after-tax wages and job opportunities. Also, shareholders would take a hit since the value of their stock holdings, including those held in pensions and mutual funds, would likely decline. Manchin said Sunday he hopes the legislation passes before the August recess, which is what Democratic leadership is hoping for. The senator’s support is notable given his stance earlier this month that he “unequivocally” wouldn’t support the climate or tax provisions of the Democratic economic package, which appeared to torpedo any hope Democrats had of passing legislation to fight climate change in the near future. But he told Tapper on Sunday that he “never did walk away” from negotiations with Schumer. “I never did walk away, but we reorganized the bill, if you will,” he said. “What we had before that, there were things in there that I considered and thought could be considered to be inflammatory. … Inflation is the greatest challenge we have in our country right now – around in my state and around the country. So that’s what we’re fighting.” Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania slammed the deal in a separate appearance later on “State of the Union,” arguing that it would negatively impact the US economy at a critical time. “We haven’t seen any text, we don’t even know what it looks like. So this is a disaster. This is going to make our recession worse. It’s going to make inflation worse. It’s not gonna do any good. I am really surprised that Joe agreed to this,” he told Tapper.

635,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/tech/amazon-irobot-roomba/,"Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) has agreed to buy iRobot, the maker of the popular Roomba vacuum, in an all-cash deal valued at about $1.7 billion, including debt, the two companies announced Friday.  The deal, which is pending approval from shareholders and regulators, has the potential to expand Amazon’s robotics lineup and deepen its presence in consumers’ homes. Last year, Amazon introduced a home robot called Astro. The $999 20-pound dog-like robot zooms from room to room, capturing live video and learning your habits. “Over many years, the iRobot team has proven its ability to reinvent how people clean with products that are incredibly practical and inventive,” said Dave Limp, SVP of Amazon Devices. “I’m excited to work with the iRobot team to invent in ways that make customers’ lives easier and more enjoyable.” After launching the first Roomba in 2002, iRobot went on to develop multiple generations of robot vacuums, mops and air purifiers that will now fall under Amazon’s product catalog. For Amazon, the acquisition represents “a further foray into the market of home automation,” according to Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData, a data analytics and consulting firm. “It is easy to see how Amazon will integrate products like Roomba into the Alexa and Prime ecosystems, so that people have one central point of monitoring and control for many tasks and activities,” he said. The deal also represents the second notable billion-dollar acquisition from Amazon in as many weeks. The e-commerce giant entered into an agreement last month to buy primary healthcare provider One Medical in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $3.9 billion. Shares of iRobot surged nearly 20% in pre-market trading Friday following the announcement.

464,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/entertainment/judith-durham-the-seekers-singer-death/,"Judith Durham, an Australian folk music star and lead singer of The Seekers, has died, according to a statement from her record label. She was 79. “After a brief stay in the Alfred Hospital, Judith was admitted to Palliative Care on Friday 5 August, where she passed away peacefully that evening. Her death was a result of complications from a long-standing chronic lung disease,” Musicoast and Universal Music Australia said in a statement shared on the verified Facebook page for The Seekers. “Our lives are changed forever losing our treasured lifelong friend and shining star. Her struggle was intense and heroic – never complaining of her destiny and fully accepting its conclusion. Her magnificent musical legacy Keith, Bruce and I are so blessed to share,” her former bandmates Keith Potger, Bruce Woodley and Athol Guy added in the post.  Durham helped open the door for Australian artists to achieve international fame. The Seekers, formed in 1962, were considered the first Australian pop band to achieve mainstream success in the United Kingdom and the United States. The group’s hits included “Georgy Girl” and “A World of Our Own.” Durham left The Seekers to pursue a solo career in 1968 and released several solo albums but continued to reunite and tour with the band in the decades after. Several prominent Australians posted tributes Saturday. “A national treasure and an Australian icon, Judith Durham gave voice to a new strand of our identity and helped blaze a trail for a new generation of Aussie artists,” wrote Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Twitter. “Her kindness will be missed by many, the anthems she gave to our nation will never be forgotten.” Australian comedian and actress Magda Szubanski shared her “deepest condolences to her loved ones” on Twitter. “Her beautiful, crystalline voice was the naive but knowing siren song of my childhood,” wrote Szubanski. Tanya Plibersek, Australian Minister for the Environment and Water, called Durham “a trailblazer and an icon in Australian music” on Twitter. “Her songs will live on forever.”",Bruce Woodley;Athol Guy;Magda Szubanski;Judith Durham;Judith Durham;Tanya Plibersek;Keith Potger,Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Facebook;Cnn;United States,"TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,379;WB_1406_DISEASES,379;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,379;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIANS,1321;LEADER,1545;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,1545;WB_2670_JOBS,1187;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1187;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,1187;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,1187;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,1187;TAX_FNCACT_ARTISTS,888;TAX_FNCACT_ARTISTS,1511;GENERAL_HEALTH,196;MEDICAL,196;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,196;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,196;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,308;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,34;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,880;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,984;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1385;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1530;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1686;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,1919;TAX_ETHNICITY_AUSTRALIAN,2010;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,64;WB_1305_HEALTH_SERVICES_DELIVERY,237;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,237;WB_1308_PALLIATIVE_CARE,237;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1545;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1928;MEDIA_SOCIAL,471;AFFECT,1433;TAX_FNCACT_COMEDIAN,1695;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,1705;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1948;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1770;",Australians;Australia;Australian;United States;Aussie;United Kingdom,429
533,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-fbi-search-analysis/,"The FBI’s search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday makes one thing crystal clear: The legal vise is tightening around the former President even as he weighs whether to run for president again in 2024. “My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump posted on Truth Social, his preferred social network, on Monday evening. He added that “they even broke into my safe.” Agents appear to be focused on the area of the sprawling estate where Trump’s living quarters and offices are located. It was not immediately clear what the FBI was after – or what, specifically, the agents were looking for. Boxes of items were taken during the search, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. We do know that federal investigators issued a subpoena to the National Archives and Records Administration in May for access to classified documents that were taken to Trump’s home in Florida – part of a grand jury investigation into whether Trump or anyone else close to him mishandled classified documents that he took with him after leaving the White House last January.  Earlier this year, 15 boxes of White House records that Trump had brought to Mar-a-Lago were retrieved and returned to the National Archives. Among the items in the returned boxes included letters from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and former President Barack Obama. The FBI search also comes on the same day that The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman revealed photos of torn-up notes appearing to bear Trump’s distinctive penmanship in toilets – one of which was in the White House.   That’s consistent with this CNN reporting from mid-February: “Three former White House officials told CNN they saw Trump, on numerous occasions, manually destroy papers he was no longer interested in or had finished reviewing – a practice that made it difficult for White House staff secretaries to preserve presidential records. Those officials said the former President sorted through file boxes in a rather methodical way – tearing up newspaper clippings or drafts of tweets that he had rejected and tossing them to the floor, or stacking papers he wished to hang on to in a disorderly stack atop his desk.” Disposing of notes, emails and other forms of presidential communication is against federal law as laid out in the Presidential Records Act. (Under the Act, all correspondence of a president is owned, ultimately, by the public.) The FBI’s execution of a search warrant also comes just days after the news broke that lawyers for Trump are in touch with the Justice Department in regards to its ongoing investigation into the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. As CNN first reported: “The talks revolve around whether Trump would be able to shield conversations he had while he was president from federal investigators. “In recent weeks, investigators have moved aggressively into Trump’s orbit, subpoenaing top former White House officials, focusing on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and executing searches of lawyers who sought to aid those efforts.” Trump, CNN has also reported, has quizzed his legal team of late as to whether he might be indicted, although he himself is skeptical it will come to that. (Worth noting: Trump is not a lawyer.) The series of developments – culminating with the high-profile search of Trump’s home on Monday – reinforce a fundamental fact of Trump’s situation: He is far more likely to see a 2024 run for president curtailed by legal problems than political ones. Politically, Trump remains the 800-pound gorilla in the Republican field. Over the weekend, he convincingly won a straw poll at a conservative gathering in Texas. And, he has all but announced his intention to run again, with the major question at this point being when he will announce his candidacy – not whether he will do so. Trump posted a campaign-style video on his Truth Social site Tuesday morning, saying “the best is yet to come.” Trump’s mounting legal woes – or at least the clear sense that this variety of investigations is getting closer and closer to him – complicate all of that. Trump under legal fire is one thing for Republicans to accept. Trump under indictment is something else entirely. We are, of course, not there yet. But, Monday’s FBI activity suggests that Trump’s legal problems are likely to get worse before they get better. And they may get way, way worse. This story has been updated with additional information.

8,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/trump-candidate-michigan-governor-primary/,"In Michigan’s jam-packed Republican primary fight for governor, former President Donald Trump is trying to tip the scales. Just days before the Tuesday primary, Trump threw his support behind Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator who has coalesced support from prominent Republicans in the state, even as she beats back criticism that she’s an establishment candidate who isn’t “MAGA” enough to inspire the GOP base.  The Mitten State’s prolonged, often bitter, Republican primary saw a handful of candidates disqualified from the ballot, while another – still in the race – was arrested for his alleged participation in the January 6, 2021, riot. Dixon is up against a handful of Trumpian candidates, some of whom have fully embraced the former President’s lies about the 2020 election.  Dixon’s embrace of those falsehoods has been more tepid. In a May debate, she raised her hand and confirmed, yes, she did believe Trump won Michigan – a state he lost by more than 154,000 votes in 2020. But in an interview with CNN, she offered a more muted response.  “I’ve talked about this at length, about the 2020 election,” Dixon said. “It was unlike any election we had ever seen obviously because of the pandemic. But in Michigan, there were some things that happened in Michigan that didn’t happen in other states, which are very concerning.” In interviews with CNN, Dixon’s opponents quickly slammed her for appearing to water down her views on the 2020 election. Garrett Soldano, a chiropractor vying for the GOP nomination, panned Dixon for dodging the 2020 election question and doubled down on his support for the former President. “The election, in my humble opinion, was stolen,” he said in an interview. “I’m not even endorsed by President Trump, and I still have his back.”  Soldano then turned his stare straight down the lens of a CNN camera, seemingly hoping to address Trump directly. “Even though, sir, you didn’t endorse me, you’re still my President,” Soldano said.  Businessman-turned-candidate Kevin Rinke also bashed Dixon for dancing around election falsehoods.  “She got an endorsement and within 48 hours when she was asked on national TV if the election was stolen, she changed her mind,” Rinke said. “That’s what politicians do. Tudor Dixon is the Republican version of Gretchen Whitmer – ‘I’ll say anything, I’ll do anything for position and power,’” he said referring to the state’s Democratic governor.  Rinke didn’t go so far as to claim the election was stolen and acknowledged that Joe Biden is the President. Still, he said he believes there were “irregularities” in 2020.  Meantime, Ryan Kelley, a real estate broker in the race, has essentially turned his arrest for allegedly participating in the Capitol riot into a campaign rallying cry.  “Look how hard these people are trying to silence me,” Kelley said in a July GOP primary debate. “I got arrested. I got kicked off Airbnb.” He has pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges he faces and has continued to falsely claim Trump won in 2020. Republican activists here have rallied behind Trump-loving, election-denying candidates. At an endorsement convention earlier this year, Republicans backed Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for attorney general, paving their path for official nominations later this year. If they win in November, they would be in key positions to oversee the state’s elections.  But the prospect of having Dixon atop the ticket has rankled some Trump supporters, particularly when it comes to her less-than-enthusiastic embrace of the election falsehoods fueling the base.  “I think she’s given lip service to President Trump and his supporters on those issues but only when truly pushed,” GOP political strategist John Yob said in an interview.  “President Trump still is very popular with conservative voters, so I think that his endorsement will definitely have an impact on this race,” Yob said. “However, it also puts things in a bit of a precarious situation with some of his supporters being left dazed and confused because they’ve been behind other, maybe more MAGA-centric, candidates and now all of a sudden he’s endorsed the establishment.” The former President’s team doesn’t share the concern that Dixon may not be as vocal on election issues, said a person close to Trump. Dixon has largely shrugged off the criticism.  “I think that’s interesting,” she said of the election-related barbs from her GOP opponents, “because my Democrat opponents actually have a whole thing – a whole list of reasons they hate me because of the election, right? I guess it’s just a campaign tactic.” Dixon said she believed she could get a boost from the Trump endorsement but declined to say whether she would back him if he runs again for president in 2024, insisting that she is focused on 2022. “I feel honored to get the endorsement. It feels like we’re really bringing everybody in the Republican Party together,” she said. “So, we feel really good about how Tuesday is going to end up, but we’re still fighting.”",Matthew Deperno;Garrett Soldano;Donald Trump;Tudor Dixon;Tudor Dixon;Kristina Karamo;Joe Biden;Kevin Rinke;Ryan Kelley;Gretchen Whitmer,Republican Party;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,510;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,699;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,3082;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,4088;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2663;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,287;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3144;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,371;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,3698;TAX_FNCACT_CHIROPRACTOR,1480;LEADER,60;LEADER,2397;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,60;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,2397;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,4435;PROTEST,645;PROTEST,2711;GENERAL_HEALTH,1197;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1197;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1197;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1197;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1197;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1197;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1197;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1197;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIANS,2218;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,3583;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,3818;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4333;ECON_HOUSING_PRICES,2608;ARREST,602;ARREST,2854;SOC_GENERALCRIME,602;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2854;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,602;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2854;TAX_WORLDFISH_BARBS,4390;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,3463;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,3641;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,3988;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,3190;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN_PARTY,4890;TRIAL,3221;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3221;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,33;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,474;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2252;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3006;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4884;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,33;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,474;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2252;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3006;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4884;TAX_FNCACT_BROKER,2615;MEDIA_MSM,2132;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,4193;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,79;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,755;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1615;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1728;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1947;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2505;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3618;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3752;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4163;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4736;WB_137_WATER,1411;DEMOCRACY,2388;ELECTION,781;ELECTION,1105;ELECTION,1146;ELECTION,1444;ELECTION,1551;ELECTION,1631;ELECTION,2050;ELECTION,2148;ELECTION,2447;ELECTION,3544;ELECTION,4236;ELECTION,4542;AFFECT,2292;AFFECT,2311;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,3016;TAX_FNCACT_ACTIVISTS,3016;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,3262;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,3181;",Michigan,1071
557,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/entertainment/fetty-wap-arrest-bond-revoked/,"Rapper Fetty Wap was arrested Monday after he allegedly threatened to kill someone and showed a gun during a FaceTime call last year, according to a court filing. Fetty Wap was indicted and arrested in October along with five others on a drug trafficking conspiracy charge.  He pleaded not guilty and was released on $500,000 bond as he awaited trial, and one of the conditions listed in the release order stated that he “must not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon.” Another said that he “must not violate any federal, state or local law.”   Prosecutors accuse Fetty Wap, whose legal name is Willie Junior Maxwell II, of violating those conditions during a December 11 FaceTime call in which he was allegedly seen holding a gun and threatening to kill an unnamed man, according to an affidavit supporting revocation filed in the Eastern District Court of New York.    New York Magistrate Judge Steven Locke revoked the rapper’s bond following his Monday arrest in New Jersey, according to John Marzulli, spokesperson for the Eastern District of New York.   In a video recording of the call, Fetty Wap allegedly pointed the gun toward him over the phone, the affidavit said. The man is identified as John Doe in the document.   “The defendant then says to John Doe ‘Imma kill you and everybody you with,’” according to the document. The affidavit alleges that the rapper threatened the man several times during the call.  CNN has reached out to an attorney for Fetty Wap for comment.

36,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/nevada-firehouse-bat-infestation/,"A bat infestation has caused a fire station in Nevada to close for an “undetermined amount of time,” according to a release from the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. “Due to an infestation of bats, it has been determined that the station is a health and safety risk to fire crews,” the release said. “Bats have been flying in the living quarters and dead bats have been found in the apparatus bay.” Fire Station 30, which dates to the 1950s, is located about 20 miles south of Reno, Nevada, and roughly 10 miles north of Carson City. The station is leased to the fire protection district from the state of Nevada.     First responders who work at the station are being relocated to a nearby station as the bat infestation is addressed. The Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District also plans to increase its coordination with the Carson City Fire Department to the south end of Washoe Valley. “The District will consult with experts to determine what preventative and remediation work is needed to eliminate the bat colonies and associated hazards,” the release said. This isn’t the first time that the fire district has faced a bat problem. “The Fire District attempted to remediate the problem in 2015, only to have the bats return,” the release said. “Staff will review possible options including contamination cleanup.” The fire district also notes that rabies is a concern when it comes to bats, along with other diseases that can be transmitted to humans.",,,"GENERAL_HEALTH,267;MEDICAL,267;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASES,1424;WB_1406_DISEASES,1424;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1424;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1424;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1374;DISASTER_FIRE,36;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,36;TAX_ETHNICITY_WASHOE,870;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_WASHOE,870;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BAT,6;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BAT,715;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BAT,1015;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BAT,1131;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BATS,213;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BATS,320;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BATS,372;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BATS,1224;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BATS,1396;TAX_DISEASE_RABIES,1361;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,1458;KILL,367;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,367;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,367;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,367;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_FIRE_STATION,44;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_FIRE_STATION,424;",Nevada;Carson City;Washoe Valley;Reno,298
139,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/steve-zissou-viktor-bout-cnntv/,"An attorney for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout said Monday he is “confident” the proposed prisoner swap of his client for Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan is going to happen.  “I do have some information about the progress of how things are going … But that information comes from the Russian side as opposed to the American side,” Bout’s attorney Steve Zissou told CNN’s John Avlon on “New Day.” “I’m confident this is going to get done.”  Zissou continued, “Look, it’s no secret they’ve been wanting him back for several years now. They’ve been trying to get him back for decades. That’s not something they’ve ever kept secret.” The US has offered Bout, who is serving a 25-year US prison sentence, as part of a potential deal to secure the release of Griner and Whelan. But Russian officials have requested that Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from the country’s domestic spy agency, be included in the US’ proposed swap of Bout for Griner and Whelan, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have told CNN.  Krasikov was convicted in December of murdering a former Chechen fighter, Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, in Berlin’s Kleiner Tiergarten in 2019 and sentenced to life in prison. The request was seen as problematic for several reasons, the sources told CNN, among them that Krasikov remains in German custody. As such, and because the request was not communicated formally but rather through a FSB backchannel, the US government did not view it as a legitimate counter to the US’ offer which was first revealed by CNN on Wednesday. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby in an earlier interview on “New Day” called the Russian’s request a “bad faith attempt” and said the country should accept the US’ offer. “This so-called, you call it a counteroffer, we would call it a bad faith attempt to avoid what is a serious proposal already on the table. And oh, by the way Brianna, has been on the table now for several weeks,” Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Monday. “Holding two Americans who have been wrongfully detained hostage for a convicted murderer in a third country is just – we don’t consider that a serious counteroffer at all. It is nothing more than a bad faith attempt by the Russians publicly to avoid what is a serious proposal, one that we are not making detailed in public and has been on the books for several weeks and we urge the Russians to accept it.” On Friday US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Russian Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. Blinken said he “pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner.” At a press conference on Friday he declined to say whether he thought Russia was more or less likely to move on the proposal following the conversation, nor would he describe how Lavrov responded. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement following the call that Lavrov “strongly suggested” to Blinken that the United States should return to a mode of “quiet diplomacy” regarding a possible prisoner exchange “without any dubious media leaks.” Prior to the call between Blinken and Lavrov, US officials had expressed frustration at Moscow’s lack of substantive response to the proposal to free Whelan and Griner. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Thursday acknowledged “this has not moved to the extent we would like.” CNN’s Natasha Bertrand, Frederik Pleitgen and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",Griner Whelan;Griner Whelan;Steve Zissou;Zelimkhan Tornike Khangoshvili;Jennifer Hansler;Viktor Bout;Vadim Krasikov;Antony Blinken;John Kirby;Natasha Bertrand;Minster Sergey Lavrov;Paul Whelan;Paul Whelan;Brittney Griner;Brittney Griner;Frederik Pleitgen;Kleiner Tiergarten,National Security Council;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;United States;Russian Foreign Ministry,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1665;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1665;TAX_ETHNICITY_GERMAN,1539;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_GERMAN,1539;KIDNAP,2295;TAX_FNCACT_SPY,876;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,3575;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3365;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3365;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3365;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,3300;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,3300;TAX_ECON_PRICE,3585;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2751;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,3002;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,3475;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1787;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,145;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2253;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,329;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHECHEN,1080;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHECHEN,1080;ARMEDCONFLICT,1088;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,345;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,691;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,1196;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,691;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,1196;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,691;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1196;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,691;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1196;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,691;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1196;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,2655;TAX_FNCACT_DEALER,50;RELEASE_HOSTAGE,752;RELEASE_HOSTAGE,2892;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1787;TRIAL,16;TRIAL,366;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,16;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,366;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIANS,2452;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIANS,2608;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIANS,2452;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIANS,2608;ARREST,112;ARREST,1307;ARREST,1408;ARREST,3330;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,38;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,313;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,782;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1235;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1336;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,1901;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,2689;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3136;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,38;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,313;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,782;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1235;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1336;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,1901;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,2689;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3136;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,1807;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,792;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1245;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1346;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3431;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_COLONEL,846;TAX_FNCACT_COLONEL,846;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2646;",Russian;Kremlin;Americans;United States;German;Russians;Russia;Ukraine;Moscow;American;Berlin,757
253,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/iyw-how-to-help-world-hunger-crisis/,"“We are in crisis mode.” Those are the words of World Food Program USA’S Barron Segar, when asked about the state of world hunger.  “There’s a sense of urgency and a sense of acting now or we’re going to see the world slip into a famine and we’re literally going to see millions of lives lost.” Many countries have struggled with food insecurity and hunger problems in the past, but recent events like the war in Ukraine have exacerbated these issues.  The numbers so far in 2022 are staggering. The UN estimates 345 million people around the world are facing acute food insecurity. That’s almost the equivalent to the population of the United States.  According to Marie Clarke, Chief of Programs from Women for Women International, those numbers are a 25% increase from January 2022, right before the start of the war in Ukraine.  “The last massive food price crisis and food crisis globally was between about 2008 and 2010. And at the time, they were setting a goal of zero hunger, by 2030. We were making a lot of progress,” Clarke said. “What we’re seeing right now, is this massive shift in the other direction.” Segar from the World Food Program USA breaks down how parts of the world are now on the brink of famine in what he calls the “4 C’s of Crisis” – Conflict, Climate, Cost and Covid.   Conflict The war in Ukraine put a major strain on the world’s food supply as both Russia and Ukraine are “breadbaskets” for countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Together they account for about 30% of the world’s wheat trade, which has largely been shut down since Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s port cities like Odesa. While there might not be any signs of the war ending soon, Russia and Ukraine recently signed a deal resuming grain exports from some of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. The first shipment was just released this week.  But as Segar reiterates, the shipments need to go out quickly and smoothly.  “We’re (The World Food Program) on standby. The ships are ready. Our staff is ready. Our boots on the ground are ready. The consequences of us not getting this grain out swiftly are dire.” It’s not just the conflict in Ukraine, however, that’s causing the hunger crisis to grow. In Afghanistan, an economy already on the brink, the Taliban takeover prompted the US and other countries to freeze an estimated $7 billion of the country’s foreign reserves .  Many in Afghanistan now rely on help from organizations like the World Food Program which estimates over 36 million people there lack sufficient food. That’s about 90% of the population.  Cost  The Ukraine war’s economic impact is global. Marianne Kajokaya and Angelina Ajonye with Women for Women International in South Sudan have seen the price of wheat rise almost 50% since the invasion began– 3,000 miles away. Maize flour, a staple in South Sudan, has tripled in price.  “The market has been changing very rapidly,” Kajokaya said. “I told [people], ‘You need to stock food in your houses.’” Kajokaya said this jump in food costs forces many people to subsist on just one meal a day. But inflation is also hurting people outside the market.  “What people felt most immediately was the cost of fuel because it was reflected in transport.” Costs of fuel quadrupled and transport between cities doubled in some instances. For some families, the rising cost of living means they can no longer afford to send their children to school and in some cases, not even afford lifesaving treatment.  Kajokaya said that malaria treatment costs about $10, but “for somebody who makes less than $1 a day, it can be really tough.” “We see lives that could have been saved, just perishing simply because people can’t afford to buy medication.”   Climate  The cost of war is also felt in countries like Somalia where a large portion of wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. But climate change is another key factor that has the Horn of Africa on the verge of famine. Somalia has suffered four consecutive failed rainy seasons and there’s not much hope that the upcoming rainy season in October will bring relief.  Wafaa Saeed, UNICEF Somalia Representative said the drought they are currently experiencing is unprecedented.  “80% of the country is either in extreme or severe drought,” Saeed said. “I’ve spoken to people who have said they have never seen a drought like this in their life.” UNICEF estimates there are 1.5 million children in the country that are malnourished and 7 million people that are acutely food insecure. That’s about half the country.  “People have nothing to feed on. Their livestock has died. They have no jobs. They cannot grow food and can’t buy food,” Saeed said.  On top of that, inflation from the war in Ukraine has caused the price of food, fuel and water to increase dramatically, leaving many desperate for help.  Saeed said some people have walked nonstop for days on end in search of help. With the effects of climate change continuing to grow however, drought is “becoming the norm.” “It is not going to go away,” Saeed said. “We have to invest in a longer term response to build the resilience of the people.” Aid in water management and drought assistance are key factors in helping people “get back to normal lives” and be able to provide for their futures.   Covid  More than two years into the pandemic, the ripple effects (and illness) are still reverberating around the world. It has touched nearly every part of daily life, affecting not only health and healthcare but also shipping, workforces and the overall economy.  “You can’t farm if you’re sick. You can’t process food if you’re sick. You can’t transport food if you’re sick. The big shipping supply chain disruptions messed up our ability to get access to food,” Marie Clarke from Women for Women International said. “There were a lot of markets that closed sometimes because the state or the country would shut the market down because of a Covid rise or surge.” The pandemic forced almost 100 million people into poverty according to some estimates, and the amount of people going hungry increased 150 million from 2020 to 2021. While much of the world is still working its way back from the pandemic setbacks, new variants of Covid continue to disrupt everyday life. How to help World hunger is a big problem but there are small steps you can take to help alleviate the food crisis. Shop for and eat local foods, support small farmers and cut down on food waste.

303,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/minnesota-morning-after-pill-lawsuit/,"A pharmacist in McGregor, Minnesota, refused to fill a woman’s morning-after pill prescription because it violated his “beliefs,” a lawsuit alleges. When Andrea Anderson’s first contraception method failed in January 2019, she turned to ella, otherwise known as the “morning after pill” or emergency contraception, to prevent a possible pregnancy, the suit filed in Aitkin County, Minnesota, said. McGregor, Minnesota, is roughly 122 miles north of Minneapolis.  Anderson got a prescription and had her doctor send it to the only pharmacy in the area at that time, the McGregor Pharmacy, according to the court document. But when she got to the pharmacy, according to the suit, “the pharmacist on duty told her that he would be unable to fill her prescription because of his ‘beliefs.’”  George Badeaux, the pharmacist, told Anderson that due to “personal reasons” he would not fill her prescription, the suit said.  Badeaux “did not clarify what his beliefs were or why they interfered with his ability to perform his job as a medical professional,” according to the complaint.   The pharmacy’s owner would later tell Anderson that he didn’t “agree with” Badeaux’s refusal to fill the prescription, but that Badeaux was a local pastor, according to the suit. Attorneys for Badeaux and the pharmacy did not return CNN’s requests for comment this week. After trying multiple pharmacies, Anderson eventually found one that would fill her prescription more than 50 miles away from where she lived, as a snowstorm was headed toward central Minnesota, the suit said.  She “drove over 100 miles round trip in the snowstorm in order to fill her prescription. While the drive normally takes over two hours round trip, that day it took over three hours in light of the storm,” the complaint said.  The complaint argues that Badeaux, along with the pharmacy, violated Minnesota’s Human Rights Act. Anderson is asking for punitive and monetary damages to be determined by a jury.  Jury selection began August 1, according to a court docket.   After the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24 2022, reproductive rights activists across the country have questioned whether contraceptive measures may be threatened, especially after Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that a ruling on that right – among others – should be revisited. The House voted 228-195 on July 21 to pass a bill that would guarantee access to contraception by protecting the right to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction. It is unclear whether the bill can pass the Senate where at least 10 Republicans are needed to side with Democrats to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold. Correction: This story has been updated to make clear the defendant pharmacy’s name. The story also misspelled the name of the county where the pharmacy is located.

522,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/08/asia/taiwan-joseph-wu-interview-china-military-drills-intl-hnk/,"China’s threat to Taiwan is “more serious than ever,” but the island will stand firm to protect its freedom and democracy – including by welcoming those who support it, Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told CNN in an interview Monday.  Wu’s defiant message came as China said it continued military drills around the self-governing island, after a four-day show of force following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taipei last week. “China has always been threatening Taiwan for years and it’s getting more serious in the last few years,” Wu said. “Whether Speaker Pelosi visits Taiwan or not, the Chinese military threat against Taiwan has always been there and that is the fact that we need to deal with.” Welcoming overseas friends to the island was a key part of Taiwan’s strategy to counter China’s attempts to isolate it from the international community – regardless of the potential backlash from Beijing, Wu said. “(China) cannot dictate to Taiwan that we should not welcome anyone who likes to come and show support for Taiwan,” said Wu, who has served as Taiwan’s foreign minister since 2018. Pelosi’s Taiwan trip – the first by a sitting House Speaker to the island in 25 years – was vehemently opposed by China’s ruling Communist Party, which views Taiwan as its territory despite never having controlled it.  In the wake of Pelosi’s visit, Beijing has ramped up pressure on Taiwan, including via economic penalties, the launch of missiles over the island for the first time, and drills that Taipei has said were meant to “simulate” an attack against its main island and navy. Though those exercises were originally expected to end Sunday, drills around Taiwan continued Monday, according to an announcement from China’s military. But as the live-fire drills raised global fears of a possible military conflict, the mood in Taiwan remained calm, with life carrying on as usual with packed restaurants and crowded public transport. For Wu, the threat made it even more critical that Taiwan continue to build its international relationships and show it is not afraid. “I worry that China may really launch a war against Taiwan,” he said. “But what it is doing right now is trying to scare us and the best way to deal with it (is) to show to China that we are not scared.” Pelosi in Taiwan  Though her trip was long mooted and much discussed, Taiwanese officials only received short notice of her arrival, Wu said.  “Since her travel is always subject to a lot of considerations, especially security considerations … we were not able to find out until the very last moment when she firmed up her plan,” Wu said, adding Taipei knew the itinerary a few days beforehand, but not the exact timing of her arrival.  The visit from the speaker and an accompanying congressional delegation included meetings at Taiwan’s legislature and the office of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, where Pelosi said they came to send an “unequivocal message” that “America stands with Taiwan.” Wu said his most memorable impression of the trip was greeting Pelosi and the delegation at the airport, where she “showed her charm” by saying she’d been looking forward to her visit for a long time.  “And by the time she departed, she not only said goodbye to me, but also said goodbye to the ground crew, the security people, and to those people who had been taking care of the airport, one by one,” Wu said. When asked whether the United States would increase its support for Taiwan after the visit, Wu said the US has always been “highly supportive” of Taiwan – but the current support was “unprecedented.” In an exclusive interview with CNN last October, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed some US military trainers were in Taiwan – the first time a Taiwanese leader had admitted to their presence since Washington and Taipei severed diplomatic ties in 1979. But perceptions of American support sparked Beijing’s ire against the speaker’s visit, with China’s foreign ministry issuing a statement on the heels of Pelosi’s arrival Tuesday evening saying her trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations,” and “gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.” Beijing announced the large-scale military exercises in what it said were six zones around the island of Taiwan swiftly after Pelosi’s arrival, in response to what it viewed as an infringement of China’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity.”  While the US and many of its allies have decried the drills, China defended its actions as “legitimate and justified,” saying it was the US, not China, who was “the biggest saboteur and destabilizer of peace in the Taiwan Strait,” where China claims “sovereign rights and jurisdiction.” ‘Wrecking’ the status quo Taiwan and China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago, in which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei. Taiwan transitioned from authoritarian rule to a democracy in the 1990s, and is now ranked one of the freest jurisdictions in Asia by Freedom House, a US-based non-profit organization. In recent years, as his power has grown, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made clear his ambitions to “reunify” with the island – by force if necessary.    Wu accused China of trying to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, including by conducting military exercises in recent days across the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China that has previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei.  Dozens of Chinese warplanes crossed the median line between Thursday and Sunday, according to accounts from Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. While the informal median line has largely preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait for decades, China now openly denies its existence.  “This kind of behavior is wrecking the status quo, and it’s wrecking peace and stability in this region and it should not be accepted,” Wu said, adding that China had sought to declare the Taiwan Strait as its internal waters for “some time” before Pelosi’s visit. That had implications beyond Taiwan as China seeks to expand its influence across the Western Pacific, Wu said. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future. “Democracy is going to prevail,” he said. “If you look at authoritarianism, it’s not resilient. It may appear strong, and it may appear to be expanding. But it’s not resilient and at some point is going to break.” When asked if the situation could be called a crisis, Wu said that was ultimately up to Beijing. “It depends on the will of the Chinese leaders to see whether they want to pursue the relations with Taiwan … in a peaceful and stable manner.” Wu said he doesn’t know whether Chinese leaders “have made up their mind” to use force to take Taiwan, but Taiwanese officials were “looking at several different scenarios,” in particular due to concerns that Beijing could seek to divert attention from domestic problems by creating a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.    “The important thing for us is that we need to be prepared,” Wu said. “We want to defend the freedom and democracy that we enjoy over here. Nobody can take that away from us.”",Joseph Wu;Joseph Wu;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi,Taiwan Defense Ministry;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Freedom House;United States;United States,"EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,2973;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2179;ARMEDCONFLICT,2311;ARMEDCONFLICT,5173;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,7091;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,7235;BORDER,5866;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2693;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3630;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,2544;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,3050;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,3222;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,4070;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,6235;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,7301;TAX_FNCACT_TRAINERS,4028;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4216;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2010;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2010;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,212;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,1270;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,3239;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,1424;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1743;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,4077;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,5492;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,409;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,584;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,1350;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,2941;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,3184;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,4271;LEADER,3060;LEADER,3980;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3060;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3980;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2276;REBELLION,5173;WB_739_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_CIVIL_WAR,5173;WB_738_SOCIAL_COHESION,5173;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,5173;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1424;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,2010;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,4434;EPU_ECONOMY,1603;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1603;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,1418;WB_137_WATER,6525;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,5289;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1392;WB_135_TRANSPORT,2129;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,212;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,1270;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3239;SOVEREIGNTY,4760;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,324;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,741;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,821;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1681;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1848;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1958;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4844;DEMOCRACY,142;DEMOCRACY,5309;DEMOCRACY,6744;DEMOCRACY,7625;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,142;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,5309;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,6744;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,7625;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,3306;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,3416;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,3697;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,3306;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,3416;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,3697;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,3306;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,3416;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,3697;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2554;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,7311;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,40;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,641;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,2152;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,625;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5485;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5934;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,7083;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,7227;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,625;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5485;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5934;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,7083;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,7227;",Taiwan;Taiwan Strait;United States;America;Chinese;Washington;Songshan;Beijing;Hualien;Taipei;American;Taiwanese;China,1451
368,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/nikolas-cruz-trial-victim-impact-statements-tuesday/,"Alyssa Alhadeff would be in her second year of college if she hadn’t been murdered in a 2018 mass shooting at her Parkland, Florida, high school – and her father would be looking forward to watching her achieve her dreams. “Soon she’d go on to be a professional soccer player. She’d get her law degree, and maybe become one of the most successful business negotiation lawyers the world would see,” Ilan Alhadeff told a Broward County courtroom Tuesday, testifying in the death penalty trial of his daughter’s killer. “She was supposed to get married, and I was going to have my father-daughter dance,” he said, his voice breaking. “She would have had a beautiful family, four kids, live in a gorgeous house – a beach house on the side.  “All those plans came to an end with Alyssa’s murder,” he said. Families of the 17 people killed in the Parkland school shooting continued taking the stand Tuesday, offering victim impact statements to illustrate the toll the murders have taken as a jury decides whether to sentence the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, to death. The hearing was emotional, as parents of some of the 14 students killed described not only who their children were, but who they will never get to become – a catalog of things left undone and unsaid.  Cruz had no visible reaction to the victim impact statements Tuesday, though one of the defense attorneys sitting next to him was seen wiping away tears.  Cruz, now 23, pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder, and this phase of his criminal trial aims to determine his sentence: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while Cruz’s defense attorneys are asking the jury for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. To recommend a death sentence, jurors must be unanimous. If they do so, the judge could choose to follow the recommendation or sentence Cruz to life instead. To make their decision, jurors will hear prosecutors and defense attorneys argue aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances – reasons Cruz should or should not be executed. Victim impact statements add another layer, giving the families and friends of the victims their own day in court, though the judge told the jury the statements are not meant to be weighed as aggravating factors.  “We were a family unit of five always trying to fit into a world set up for even numbers,” said Tom Hoyer, whose 15-year-old son Luke – the youngest of three – was killed. “Two-, four-, six-seat tables in a restaurant. Two-, four-, six-ticket packages to events. Things like that.” But the Hoyers are no longer a family of five, and “never again will the world feel right, now that we’re a family of four,” Hoyer said. “When Luke died something went missing in me,” he said. “And I’ll never, never get over that feeling.”  ‘I will never get over it’ Nicholas Dworet, captain of the high school’s swim team, had just received a scholarship to the University of Indianapolis at the time he was killed, his mother, Annika Dworet, testified Tuesday. He wanted to study finance and move to Boston with his girlfriend. “Nick had big goals – bigger than most of us dare to dream of,” she said. Next to his bed, he’d taped a note which read, “I want to become a Swedish Olympian and go to Tokyo 2020 to compete for my country. I will give all I have in my body and my mind to achieve the goals I have set.” “Now,” Annika Dworet said, “we will never know if he would have reached his goal to go to the Olympics.”  Jennifer Guttenberg, mother of 14-year-old Jaime, told the court watching her daughter’s friends and classmates grow up and achieve things Jaime never will is “excruciatingly difficult.” Family get-togethers and holidays are hard, too, with one less seat at the table and no Jaime to keep “everyone upbeat and laughing.” “There is togetherness, but there is no celebrating,” Guttenberg said. “There is a deafening silence amongst everyone, as they don’t want to bring up Jaime’s name to cause pain, but don’t want to forget her, either.” The last four years have been no less painful for Linda Beigel Schulman, who told the court Monday it had been 1,630 days since she spoke to her son Scott Beigel, a geography teacher killed as he ushered students to safety in his classroom. “I will never get over it. I will never get past it,” she said Monday. “My life will never, ever be the same.”  ‘Our lives have been shattered’ Cruz had no visible reaction Monday to any of the victim impact statements, though one of his defense attorneys was seen wiping away a tear, as were at least two members of the jury.  “It’s been four years and four months since he was taken from us, his friends and his family,” Patricia Oliver said of her son, who was 17 when he was killed. “We miss him more than words can say and love him dearly,” she said, adding, “Our lives have been shattered and changed forever.” Joaquin’s sister, Andrea Ghersi, said her 6-foot-1 baby brother was “energetic, vibrant, loud, confident, strong, empathetic, understanding, smart, passionate, outgoing, playful, loving, competitive, rebellious, funny, loyal and constantly spoke up when he felt something was not just.” Victoria Gonzalez also took the stand Tuesday. The day of the shooting, she became Joaquin’s girlfriend, Gonzalez told the court, but they already referred to each other as “always soul mates,” and she described him as “magic personified, love personified.” His name, she said, is “etched into the depth of my soul.”  Gena Hoyer, mother of Luke Hoyer, said her 15-year-old son’s room remains the same. His glasses and charger are still on the nightstand and his clothes go untouched, she testified. She becomes physically ill when she moves anything in the room, she said. Meadow Pollack’s mother, Shara Kaplan, told the jurors to articulate how her daughter’s death affected her she would have to rip out her heart and show them it’s been shattered in a million pieces. “(Meadow’s death) has destroyed my life and my capability of ever living a productive existence,” she said. Kelly Petty, mother of victim Alaina Petty, described the late 14-year-old as a “very loving person.” “She loved her friends, she loved her family and, most importantly, she loved God,” Kelly Petty said of her daughter. “I am heartbroken that I won’t be able to watch her become the amazing young woman she was turning into.” Alaina’s sister Meghan echoed the sentiment, telling the court, “I would have loved to see her grow up. She would have been a blessing to the world.” CNN’s Carlos Suarez, Kevin Conlon and Denise Royal contributed to this report.",Sara Weisfeldt;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Joaquin Oliver;Joaquin Oliver;Joaquin Oliver;Teresa Reid;Patricia Oliver;Andrea Ghersi;Carlos Suarez,University Of Florida Levin College Of Law;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Mcdonald;Mcdonald,"TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,4955;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,126;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1023;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1627;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1910;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3330;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3583;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,126;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1023;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1627;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1910;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3330;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3583;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,2771;EDUCATION,98;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,98;RETALIATE,3049;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,2257;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,2582;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,3718;SURVEILLANCE,4211;SURVEILLANCE,4345;REBELLION,4013;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,809;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1635;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1918;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3338;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3591;KILL,105;KILL,1160;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,105;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1160;MEDIA_SOCIAL,467;MEDIA_SOCIAL,603;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,467;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,603;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,467;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,603;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,467;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,603;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,746;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1360;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2196;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2562;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,2952;WB_470_EDUCATION,2952;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,2952;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,2952;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2962;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_COLLEGE,3005;TERROR,305;TERROR,427;TERROR,563;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,467;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,603;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,467;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,603;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,467;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,603;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,311;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,784;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2218;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2368;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2082;SOC_GENERALCRIME,2114;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,2431;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,182;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,889;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,454;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,590;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,735;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1349;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1538;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1821;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,2688;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,2839;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,3248;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,3501;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,3664;CRISISLEX_C01_CHILDREN_AND_EDUCATION,2848;DEATH_PENALTY,319;DEATH_PENALTY,792;DEATH_PENALTY,2226;TRIAL,319;TRIAL,792;TRIAL,2226;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,2310;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,2310;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2310;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2310;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2310;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,2145;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,2771;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,4168;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,4302;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,2771;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,4168;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,4302;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2980;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,126;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,1023;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,1627;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,1910;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,3330;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,3583;LEGISLATION,3012;EPU_POLICY_LAW,3012;TAX_FNCACT_BABY,3846;",Broward County;Florida,1477
59,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/what-is-vote-a-rama/,"Democrats’ push to advance their energy and health care bill is likely headed for a procedural speed bump known in Washington as a “vote-a-rama.”  The time-consuming and stamina-challenging process is among the final obstacles for Democrats, along with the Senate parliamentarian’s review of the package. Politically, a vote-a-rama gives Republicans a chance to sow discord and create distractions as they force Democrats to vote on controversial issues. But, once it’s over, Democrats have the opportunity to advance their package on a straight party-line vote that would not be subject to the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold. Here’s what you need to know: What is a vote-a-rama? Usually in the legislative process, lawmakers can use a series of procedural maneuvers to avoid voting on amendments. But in a budget reconciliation process – which Democrats are using to advance their bill – you can’t do that. Lawmakers cannot hold a final vote on a reconciliation bill until all the amendments have been “disposed of,” or in simpler terms, “voted on.” The practice involves votes on a series of amendments that can – and usually do – stretch for hours. How do lawmakers use the process? The party in charge typically wants to move this vote-a-rama along as quickly as possible with as few votes as possible. The minority party takes the opportunity to force votes on all kinds of measures they don’t typically have the power to put on the floor. How long does each vote take? Usually, lawmakers agree to a process that looks a lot like this. Each amendment takes about 15 minutes or so to get through. The process moves quickly by Senate standards, which is why it is so important for members to basically stay in or close by the chamber for the entire marathon event. What’s in the bill? The bill contains a number of Democrats’ goals, including some provisions that party leaders have worked toward for years: Still, this isn’t Build Back Better 2.0. The package is less than half the size of Biden’s original social safety net plan, and a number of key Democratic priorities are likely to be left out.

111,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/entertainment/maneskin-world-tour/,"No matter how you pronounce their name, Italian rock group Maneskin may be one of today’s most famous and successful global musical acts. In 2021, the band – made up of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi and drummer Ethan Torchio – won Europe’s biggest song competition, Eurovision, and has been unstoppable ever since. They’ve scored three number one hits just this year on the Billboard rock charts: Their viral cover of Frankie Valli’s “Beggin’,” “I Wanna be Your Slave” and “Supermodel.” They were also recently nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards, including Best New Artist. They’ve dropped by the “Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” and headlined “Saturday Night Live.”  Just over a year ago, the four rockers were little-known musicians playing in the streets of Rome and fighting other street performers for a spot on the corner that would attract the most people. Now, attracting a crowd is as simple as announcing their next concert.  Earlier this month, they played to a sold-out crowd of 70,000 at Rome’s iconic Circus Maximus and have been invited to perform at some of the largest music festivals in the US, including Coachella and Lollapalooza, where they will appear for the first time this Sunday.  This fall, they will embark on their first world tour, which will take them all over the United States, Europe and Latin America with tickets selling fast and dates extending into 2023.  CNN correspondent Maria Santana caught up with Maneskin in New York before they were set to perform for a smaller, more intimate crowd at the city’s “House of X” as part of Sirius XM’s Small Stage Series, and talked to them about their meteoric rise to fame, their humble beginnings, the next stops on their world tour, covering the “King of Rock n Roll,” Elvis Presley, and why they are standing up for the people of Ukraine. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. The first thing I need to ask is how do you pronounce your band’s name? All: Moan-Ah-Skin! Santana: I always hear Man-Eh-Skin. Victoria De Angelis: Yeah, everything is fine. Santana: So, Moan-A-Skin? Thomas Raggi: Moan-A-Skin is perfect. And what does Maneskin mean? De Angelis: It means moonlight. I picked it when we first started playing because we needed to join this musical competition, and we didn’t have a name yet, so they just told me just say random words in Danish, and we chose one. Looking back at this last year, I’m sure it’s been absolutely crazy for you, from where you were a year ago to now? Damiano David: Yeah, it’s been a crazy journey, but of course we are really happy about everything that we did, and every time we look back, all the steps, we are super happy and proud. What has been the most surprising, maybe the most exciting thing, that has happened to you this past year? Raggi: I think that we’ve had lots of incredible moments during this last year. Maybe a song with Iggy Pop is one of these, of course, and playing with The Stones. I mean a lot, it’s been a lot. Now you’re filling stadiums with 70,000 people, selling out tickets for 80,000, and you’ve said it was really hard for you guys to even find a place to play in Italy. What was that like when you started?  De Angelis: It was very difficult because in Rome there’s no real rock scene, so there’s no like clubs wanting bands to play their stuff, and also people are not very used to going to gigs of upcoming artists. They just go to the famous ones that they already know, so it was really hard and that’s why we started playing as buskers on the streets. We were always fighting with the other street artists about having the best spot, and we never won, but … (laughter). And then you do Eurovision, how did it change your life? David: I think that was our first actual window outside of Italy. Since that moment we were only basing our projects for Italy and on Italy and that was the chance to break out in Europe, then from Europe to the US, and we hope to grow more and more. What was it like to win for Italy? It had been like 30 years since Italy had won Eurovision, and then you win with rock n’ roll, a genre which is not very big there? Raggi: Yes, that’s crazy. David: That was unexpected I think for everybody. De Angelis: Yeah, everyone was very proud, big celebration. A lot of times for Eurovision winners, they have that big moment and then they kind of disappear. What do you think makes you guys different that you’ve been able to take this and catapult so much and become this worldwide phenomenon? David: I think for us Eurovision came at a very right moment because we had just come out with an album, so what we brought to Eurovision was basically just one of the things of the whole album and it was fresh, and it was super authentic for us. So, I think that people were happy to find a lot of coherence between what we brought to Eurovision and what they saw in our catalogue, and they felt like, OK, this is not just a viral song that they made specifically for Eurovision, but it’s just one of their songs and then they have two albums, and it all makes sense. Then, you release “Beggin,’ ” which turns into the most successful rock song of last year. I mean, I woke up every morning I think for the last year like, (sings), “I’m beggin’, beggin’ you”… (laughter) … It just gets in my head, and then I’m like, come on, just get out! David: Yeah, it’s our fault, it’s our fault, (laughter). Well, it’s not even our fault because we didn’t even promote it. It’s TikTok’s fault. It just got viral. We were pretty shocked by it. When we saw it growing, we were like, what is happening, and then we found out it was viral on TikTok and all that came about after. Why that song? It’s a cover of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, and I can’t think of a more different style than you guys and The Four Seasons. De Angelis: Actually, we played it at first, when we just started, and we think it’s way more challenging and fun to make covers of very different songs. So, like now we’re also playing “Womanizer” by Britney Spears, for example, and we just find it a challenge and stimulating, and it really makes you do an interpretation of something different and bringing it into your own. That’s when you make something good, I think. You also covered “If I Can Dream” for the Elvis movie, what was it like singing an Elvis song? I mean, you know, “The King of Rock n’ Roll.” David: Well, every time when we have some big deals, we try not to think about it that much because then you get like anxious, and you feel the pressure. When we had the chance to play a cover of Elvis, we didn’t feel like we were confronting Elvis because that would have been impossible, you cannot try to fight with Elvis’ heritage. We were just super happy and super glad and super honored just to have the chance to play one of his songs, and we focused on that, and we focused on doing the best that we could do on that song without even comparing it with the Elvis one because, of course, it’s untouchable. Now you have two VMA nominations and a third number one song on the Billboard charts, “Supermodel,” can you tell me what the song is about? De Angelis: The funny thing is that everyone thinks it’s about supermodels, but it’s not. We wrote it after being like three months in L.A. where we met a lot of people that were faking being supermodels or superstars. Everyone was very focused on the way they appeared and not what they’re really like or who they really were. Everyone was just trying to fake that they have the best clothes, best friends, best club, that kind of stuff, and we found it a bit stupid, of course, but it was something that we thought was only shown in movies, like a stereotype, you know, but when we saw it in person, we just thought it was fun and wanted to make a funny song about it. I can tell you no one in New York is like that. We are very real. If you had to make a song about New York, what would it be about? De Angelis: Ohhh … (laughs) … we need to spend more months here. David: I think it would be like a club song, super dirty, clubbish … (laughter). You’ve played different festivals, like Lollapalooza in Europe, but this weekend you are doing Lollapalooza in Chicago. What does it mean to play at Lollapalooza here in the US? Raggi: Crazy, it’s huge. De Angelis: It’s our first Festival in the USA. So, that’s like a big, big thing … David: It’s not our first festival! We played at Coachella, c’mon! … (Laughter). De Angelis: Whoops, that’s true, Coachella. We started this festival season this summer, and it’s only been Europe until now, so for this summer it’s the first. Raggi: For the summer, yes. You sing in English and Italian, but we have a lot of Italian singers who are huge in Latin America, and they sing in Spanish – Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Il Volo – do you think you would ever sing in Spanish? David: Why not? De Angelis: In Spanish? David: I basically mostly listen to Spanish sounding music, so I would not back up … (laughs). You’re going to launch your tour, and you’re going to Latin America, Santiago, Buenos Aires. What’s it like going to all these places, is it a culture shock when you go? David: Yeah, you know, we have never been, outside of Ethan, we’ve never been to Latin America, and we never played there, but of course, we know something about the people there, and we know that they’re really crazy … (laughter) … hyped up, heated up, and we like these kinds of crowds. So, we can’t wait to play there, and it was one of the places that amazed me the most. When I saw the tickets that were selling, it was like “what the f**k?”, how did we get there? It was crazy, so we really can’t wait to be there. How has fame changed you, if at all? De Angelis: I don’t think it has changed us. David: I’m less worried about things, actually. I guess I’m stable … (laughs). Do you feel that fame, when you’re this well-known, it comes with a responsibility to speak out on certain political issues? A lot of artists say, I’m an entertainer, not a politician or an activist. De Angelis: Yeah, for us, I think it comes naturally, so when we think we know enough about a topic, and we think our opinion can, like, make the difference or something we don’t feel it like as a pressure or something. It just comes naturally, and we’re happy to do it. Also, if we can share a positive message on something that really matters to us, we’re happy to do it. If not, we also don’t feel the pressure to have to do it. You did a song in support of Ukraine, “We’re Gonna Dance on Gasoline,” how do you feel about that situation? David: It’s really hard to say that because we feel very bad about it, but we also know that we have a huge privilege, with no worries, we’re not worried that something is going to happen to us. So, we are privileged, but of course, if we can spread knowledge about it, we are more than happy, and we feel that we have to do it because that’s something that is happening today and if we can do something today, it’s more valuable. One of your first songs was “Zitti E Buoni,” which means “Shut Up and Behave.” It doesn’t seem like you guys are going to be doing any shutting up or behaving any time soon. De Angelis: No, not at all. Where do you go from here? De Angelis: I don’t know, we feel very free. We just want to keep playing.

639,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/victoria-spartz-ukraine-republican-reaction/,"When a bipartisan group of lawmakers visited the Ukraine border in March, an unexpected guest showed up on the trip: GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana. Spartz, the first Ukrainian-born member of the US Congress and an outspoken advocate for her home country, had expressed interest in joining the congressional delegation but wasn’t invited to attend the trip, which consisted primarily of House Foreign Affairs Committee members, a panel where Spartz is not a member.  So, she used her own funds to fly to the border of Ukraine in Poland and linked up with lawmakers once there to join in on some of their meetings, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Her surprise appearance, the circumstances of which have not been previously reported, was initially viewed as a welcome addition – albeit an unusual one – as lawmakers sought to rally Western support for Ukraine amid Russia’s bloody assault on the country that began a week earlier. But members who were part of the official trip told CNN that Spartz was “argumentative,” “accusatory,” and “unhelpful” during key meetings with NATO members, generals and government officials, sparking concern that her presence was doing more harm than good. “She crashed our CoDel. She was like a bull in a china shop,” said one GOP lawmaker, who like other members for this story was granted anonymity to speak more freely about a colleague and due to the sensitive nature of the subject. “I don’t know if it was pent-up frustration or she didn’t feel like she was getting enough proper information, but she was just accusatory and rude.”  Spartz, in an email to CNN, pushed back on the anonymous criticism of her decision to elbow her way into the congressional delegation and refuted the description of her behavior on the trip. “This accusation is a cowardly misrepresentation of facts by some jealous members or staff since we had a very productive bipartisan CODEL in March,” Spartz said. “I did not come to Congress to get paid for my travel vacations or dinners, but rather get things done. I have always been willing to spend my own hard-earned money to help with causes I care about.” That bipartisan frustration over Spartz’s behavior was only the beginning. In the nearly six months since the war began, Spartz has publicly criticized the Ukraine government, peddled corruption allegations against the Ukrainian government and some of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top aides, and spurred complaints from her colleagues that she is mirroring pro-Russia talking points.  “President Zelensky has to stop playing politics and theater, and start governing to better support his military and local governments,” Spartz said in a press release last month, in one example of her outspoken criticisms of Kyiv.  Spartz, a 43-year-old businesswoman, has repeatedly insisted, publicly and privately, that she wants Ukraine to win, and that she is only attacking Kyiv because she wants to help remove any potential obstacles to a Ukrainian victory over Russia. She says she has visited Ukraine six times since the invasion began and has also slammed Russia consistently, including as recently as Tuesday when she tweeted that Russia should be declared a terrorist state.  Still, Spartz’s bellicose rhetoric aimed at Zelensky and his advisers has frustrated lawmakers in both parties, White House officials and members of the Ukrainian parliament alike. They worry she is undermining their efforts to stay united behind Ukraine at a pivotal moment and openly question where she is getting some of her information, according to interviews with over a dozen lawmakers, aides and administration sources. Meanwhile, multiple briefings from the Biden administration and private pleas from senior Republicans have done little to rein in Spartz’s vocal criticism, sources said.  Once seen as a crucial messaging asset, Spartz has now become something of a liability for defense hawks who were already worried about fatigue in the United States over the ongoing war abroad. And her continued criticism of Ukraine also comes amid growing skepticism from the MAGA wing of the GOP about keeping weapons and aid flowing to the country. “Because she’s the only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, she has outsize megaphone, outsize influence,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat and former CIA analyst, said to CNN. “I think there’s an open question of why she’s so openly saying something that’s so clearly aligned with Russian talking points.” Spartz contends she has long been concerned about corruption in Ukraine. But lawmakers fear her public criticism could undermine confidence in Zelensky, damage relations between the U.S. and Ukraine, and give on-the-fence lawmakers a reason to oppose the next aid package. Some lawmakers – even those unhappy with her rhetoric – came to Spartz’s defense, arguing she is well-intentioned and just desperate to help her motherland as it’s being ripped apart by war. Spartz was a vocal champion of key legislation to speed up the administration’s ability to send weaponry and other critical resources to Ukraine, attending the bill signing ceremony with President Joe Biden. And lawmakers in both parties have shared in her calls for more rigorous oversight of the weapons heading into Ukraine. “She was overcome with emotion. And I think what you’re seeing now is a manifestation of that,” said a second GOP lawmaker. “What I’m trying to tell her is, I’m well aware of the corruption problem. … But talking about corruption now, when they are under siege, is like wall-papering your bathroom when the house is burning down around you. It’s counterproductive.” Spartz said in an email to CNN that she is just seeking accountability and always gets her information “from the ground and real professionals, not from academics and political hacks who’ve never set foot in Ukraine.” And Spartz said it was the “foreign policy establishment” – not her – who was playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hands. “I also care deeply about people’s lives – the lives of ordinary Ukrainians and the brave Ukrainian military. I cannot let them down even if that means saying unpopular truths that offend the politicians or diverge from the popular narrative of the day,” Spartz said. “I will never give up or give in, and I will do everything I can to see a united Ukraine and a defeated Vladimir Putin.”     Members of both parties push to tone down posture  Even as lawmakers express understanding and sympathy for Spartz’s situation, the top three Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Armed Services Committee have all urged Spartz to tone down her posture, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.  “We’ve all talked to her,” said a third GOP lawmaker. “It’s pissing people off. Because it hurts the cause.” Spartz herself has expressed interest in joining the House Foreign Affairs Committee next year, sources said. But given her recent behavior, some GOP members have warned Republican leaders against that, with one lawmaker saying they would be “very upset” if she received that assignment. When asked about the pushback she’s gotten from top Republican colleagues surrounding her rhetoric and whether it’s playing into Russian disinformation campaigns, Spartz responded: “not true.” “Republican leadership has been supportive and appreciate my demands for accountability and a real strategy for the war effort in Ukraine,” she said. Spartz also admonished her colleagues for making anonymous claims about her interest in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “A lot of members of Congress behave immaturely and are deeply unserious dealing with very serious issues,” she said.  The Biden administration has also gotten involved. Spartz recently received a nearly two-hour briefing from officials from the National Security Council and State Department after requesting one from the White House about Ukraine, sources familiar with the meeting told CNN, where the officials walked through her claims of improper behavior inside the Ukrainian government and either refuted the allegations or said there was not enough evidence to support them.  Spartz also requested a meeting with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley to discuss her concerns, the sources said. The meeting was first reported by Politico. When they met, she again raised concerns about corruption in Ukraine and alleged that US-provided weapons were not going to the right places.  Milley did not dismiss her concerns outright, the sources said – US officials believe corruption continues to be a problem in Ukraine. In a recent call with Ukrainian counterparts, Milley, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed “the importance of Ukraine continuing to implement its reform agenda” with regard to corruption, “despite the challenges caused by the war,” according to a readout provided by the White House.  Broadly, however, Milley explained to Spartz that her concerns were overwrought, the sources explained.  Spartz told CNN that her meeting with Milley “was not my first meeting with him,” and that “I give him credit for his willingness to listen.” “I believe he understands the challenges of our effort in Ukraine, but the politicians and foreign policy establishment are making strategic decisions, not military leaders,” she said. “This should trouble all Americans as these are the know-nothing know-it-alls who oversaw the debacle in Afghanistan, and other foreign policy blunders, and have faced zero accountability.” Several days after meeting with Milley, Spartz continued her public attacks on one of Zelensky’s top aides, accusing him of “creating a per se dictatorship under the disguise of the ongoing war.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN he has not privately spoken to Spartz about her criticism of the Ukraine government. But he did credit the Indiana lawmaker for being passionate about the issue and helping to draw attention to the war – especially in the early days of the conflict, when Spartz delivered an emotional public plea to the Biden administration for a concrete Ukraine strategy during a GOP press conference that garnered widespread media coverage. “The thing you’ve got to understand: she’s got family there, she’s very passionate about it,” McCarthy said. “It’s very personal.” Concerns about Spartz abroad There is also concern about Spartz’s behavior abroad. Slotkin said Spartz came up in multiple meetings and dinners when she was recently in Kyiv and that last week she received a text message from a member of the Ukrainian parliament saying they don’t know if Spartz is being “played” but “she has ruined her reputation in Ukraine.” “All the senior leaders were talking about it. They’re upset about it,” Slotkin said. “They don’t understand why she’s doing this.” Ukrainian officials have become increasingly alarmed by Spartz’s rhetoric over the last several months, Ukrainian sources told CNN, particularly her persistent attacks on Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak. In tweets last month, she accused Yermak of “undemocratic governance” and said he had a “negative reputation” globally. And on July 8, Spartz sent a letter to Biden requesting a briefing specifically about Yermak “and his alleged dealings in connection with Russia.” Spartz’s accusations are similar to those reported by Radio Free Europe before the war, which alleged Yermak had business ties to Russia. That allegation has been used by Zelensky’s critics to suggest Yermak might be too willing to bend to Kremlin demands, particularly following a controversial prisoner swap deal in 2021. There is no evidence that he is under the Kremlin’s sway, however, and he has denied the allegations.  Ukrainian officials have questioned Spartz’s motivations. In text messages to a Zelensky aide on June 24, Spartz offered to “connect” the aide “with the right people” who she said could help Ukraine’s army win.  “Do you want me to send someone good to discuss training when you are back or maybe he could meet with Reznyk or someone else this coming week?” Spartz asked, referring to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov. “Some of them can also bring some very advanced equipment for you to use … he will do it as a favor for you and for me so we will have to keep these meetings ‘off the record,’” Spartz wrote.  Asked about these texts, Spartz told CNN they were taken out of context and that she has “simply been trying to help make connections for anyone willing to help Ukraine win the war especially to some veterans who can give free and unbiased advice as a favor to me since they are my friends.” She added that “the insinuation I have some financial interest is flatly untrue; I’m spending tens of thousands of my own money to help in Ukraine. Mr. Yermak’s financial interests are what merits investigation.” Ukrainian officials have offered to set up a meeting between Yermak and Spartz to clear the air, but Spartz has declined to take it, sources said. Spartz acknowledged that she was offered a meeting with Yermak after she sent the letter to Biden, but then the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry criticized her attacks on Yermak as “cynical” and “baseless.” “I determined this meeting would not be productive under those circumstances,” she said.",Mark Milley;Kevin Mccarthy;Andriy Yermak;Daniel Berehulak;Joe Biden;Volodymyr Zelensky;Elissa Slotkin;Antony

596,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/europe/russia-recruits-prisoners-ukraine-war-cmd-intl/,"Promises of freedom and riches are made to convicts in cramped jail cells. Frantic phone calls ensue between relatives and inmates weighing the offer. Then prisoners vanish, leaving their loved ones to sift through reports of the wounded arriving in hospitals. This scene is playing out in the convict communities across Russia. With a regular army stretched thin after nearly six months of a disastrously executed and bloody invasion of Ukraine, there’s increasing evidence that the Kremlin is making ugly choices in its ugly war and recruiting Russia’s prisoners to fight. Over a month-long investigation, CNN has spoken to inmates caught up in Russia’s newest recruitment scheme, along with their relatives and friends. Activists believe hundreds have been approached in dozens of prisons across Russia – from murderers to drug offenders. Some have even been taken from the prison where one high-profile American jailed in Russia, Paul Whelan, is held. His brother David said in a statement in July he had heard ten volunteers had left IK17 in Mordovia for the frontlines in Ukraine Dozens of chat messages between relatives, reviewed by CNN, detail the tempting rewards offered to fight in Ukraine, where the risk of death is high. The latest Western assessments suggest up to 75,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured since the invasion began (a claim the Kremlin has denied).  One prisoner spoke to CNN from his cramped jail cell, a cat crawling across bunk beds, and a fan clamped on top of an ageing television tried to cool the air between heavily barred windows. Imprisoned for multiple years for drugs offenses, he spoke on condition of anonymity using a contraband smartphone – quite common in Russia’s prison system – to outline the conditions on offer.  “They will accept murderers, but not rapists, pedophiles, extremists, or terrorists”, he said. “Amnesty or a pardon in six months is on offer. Somebody talks about 100,000 rubles a month, another 200,000. Everything is different.” He said the offer was made when unidentified men, believed to be part of a private military contractor’s firm, came to the prison in the first half of July, and that acceptance into the program would lead to two weeks of training in the Rostov region in southern Russia. While he had two years’ service in the military, he said the recruiters did not seem to insist on military experience.  “In my case, if it’s real, then I’m all for it,” the prisoner said. “It can make a real difference for me: be imprisoned for nearly a decade, or get out in six months if you’re lucky. But that’s if you’re lucky. I just want to go home to the children as soon as possible. If this option is possible, then why not?” The prisoner said 50 inmates had already been selected for recruitment and placed into quarantine in the prison, but he had heard that 400 applied. Rights activists working in the Russian prison system said since the start of July they had been flooded with reports from across Russia from anxious relatives, concerned of the fate of their inmates. “In the last three weeks [in July], there is a very big wave of this project to recruit thousands of Russian prisoners and send them to the war,” said Vladimir Osechkin, head of Gulagu.net, a prisoner advocacy group.   Osechkin said some were promised a pay-out to their families of five million rubles ($82,000) if they died, but all the financial rewards might never be honored. “There is no guarantee, there’s no real contract. It is illegal”, he said.  Some of the prisoners and their family members appeared keen for the recruitment to go ahead, Osechkin said, echoing the responses of some inmate families seen by CNN. Osechkin speculated the prisoners were used effectively as bait, to attract the fire of Ukrainian positions and enable the regular Russian military to strike accurately back. “They go first, and when the Ukrainian army sees them, and they strike. Then Russian soldiers see where the Ukrainians are, and bomb the place”. CNN reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry and penitentiary service (FSIN) for comment on allegations that prisoners are being recruited to fight in Ukraine. Neither responded. While recruitment is in its early days, the first reports have emerged among family members of injured prisoners being hospitalized in the Russian-backed separatist area of Luhansk. CNN has viewed chat messages exchanged between relatives of inmates already apparently sent to the frontline. One wife details how she contacted her husband, who lay injured in one Luhansk hospital. The wife said only three prisoners from her husband’s unit of ten were still alive. CNN is aware of the identity of the injured prisoner, but has been unable to confirm his hospitalisation, as separatist medical facilities are veiled in secrecy. Other messages between relatives also detailed the quiet desperation of prisoners, caught up in a Russian justice system where 99% of cases brought to trial result in conviction, and corruption weighs heavy on an over-burdened penal system. This month, one prisoner messaged his brother on WhatsApp about his decision to go.  Moscow’s manpower options have ebbed over five-plus months of clumsy and gruelling invasion. Russian President Vladimir Putin initially stated no conscripts had been deployed in the war, before his ministry of defense admitted they had withdrawn some from the frontlines after their deployment in apparent error. The Kremlin has said there will be no general mobilization in Russia, perhaps fearing the policy would prove unpopular, especially if losses spread across the population did not significantly alter the battlefield dynamic. Prison recruitment is, activists and prisoners said, under the auspices of the Wagner private military contractor, which is not subject to the Russian military’s ban on employing convicts. The prisoners have not shared any copies of their contracts with their relatives or activists, so the precise terms or employer remain unclear. Wagner – which works globally and is run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a man known as Putin’s chef – is Russia’s most ubiquitous military contractor. Prigozhin denies ties to Wagner. The lack of clarity, coupled with the silence of their loved ones, only adds to relative’s anxieties. Oksana, the half-sister of a Russian prisoner who had been offered deployment, said his mother had initially been keen to receive the salary from her son’s service, but, since he vanished from their messaging apps, was beside herself with worry.  “We know he was in Rostov Oblast,” Oksana said, adding he had claimed he was in another prison’s factory. “He rang her on a new WhatsApp number on 10th July and asked her to send a copy of her passport so she would get his wages,” she said. This meant it was less likely he was in prison, she said, as an inmate’s wages from prison labor are usually paid into their own account. “I am in contact with many relatives and they all have the same scenario: Send passport details. No contact,” she said. “These are the least protected part of the population. Putin said no conscripts would be sent, but they were. With convicts, it will be very hard to reveal they have been sent.” Oksana’s name has been changed due to security concerns.  In late July, the mother received a message from another new number, familiarly written in her son’s broken Russian. It insisted he was healthy, and OK, but gave no details as to his whereabouts. “There is some time left but it is going quickly”, he wrote. “When I can I will call you.” The mother was later rang by a person introducing themselves as an “accountant,” who pledged to bring her son’s salary in cash to her a week later.",Yevgeny Prigozhin;Vladimir Osechkin;Vladimir Putin;Paul Whelan,Russian Defense

488,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/uvalde-school-district-interim-police-chief-search/,"The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District is searching for an interim police chief as Chief Pete Arredondo is on unpaid leave while he awaits a termination hearing, school board Superintendent Hal Harrell said Monday. “We continue to search and talk to different organizations about an interim police chief or an interim team,” Harrell said in a public meeting Monday evening. “There have been four officers who have been recommended for hire. They are all from out of town and they look like very promising candidates, lots of years of experience. So we will continue on that progress as well.” The board’s search was previously reported by the online newspaper Uvalde Hesperian, citing comments given by school board President Luis Fernandez at a Rotary Club meeting last week.  Arredondo was placed on unpaid leave following his highly criticized handling of the massacre at Robb Elementary School in May, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials have said Arredondo was the on-scene commander during the shooting, but the chief has disputed this, saying he did not believe he was in charge. The Uvalde superintendent recommended Arredondo be fired in the wake of the tragedy and amid growing anger from residents and families who demanded the chief be terminated from the position. The school board has postponed Arredondo’s termination hearing twice because of requests from his attorney involving his right to due process. Most recently, the board pushed off the meeting due to a “scheduling conflict” which prevented the hearing from being held on August 4, the district said. A new hearing date was not set at the time. Harrell also provided updates on safety measures being implemented for the new school year, including at least 500 cameras to be purchased for the district, designated points of entry for parents and visitors and the continued installation of fences, although it’s not clear if the fences will be completed by the first day of school. The school district recently completed a wifi audit to see what needs to be strengthened and is also in the process of getting an estimate for security film and glass, Harrell said. He said the school district has spent approximately $4.5 million on security and community support this summer, which was from a variety of funding resources.  The Texas Department of Public Safety has officially agreed to have 33 officers assigned to Uvalde school campuses and will remain there throughout the school year, Harrell said. He added that each officer will be assigned to a designated campus. “We know going back to school will be especially challenging for many in Uvalde,” DPS Director Steven McCraw said in a release about the additional officers. “The Texas Department of Public Safety is committed to working with the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District to ensure each child, parent, and teacher feels safe and protected during this difficult time. There is no task more important than this.” Harrell also announced that there will be an option to attend school virtually in the upcoming year. Uvalde parent, Adam Martinez, said he will likely keep his two children in virtual learning, saying that even though some of the security measures are reassuring, his son said that an increased number of officers doesn’t make him feel safer because he believes officers didn’t help during the massacre.  “As of right now, we’ll just continue virtual and see if somehow we can change the perception of the school officers or the police officers in general because right now, it seems like the children don’t have any confidence. They are going to school scared,” Martinez told CNN.  Martinez said he is one of the parents helping to file grievances against the school board, Harrell and other school staff. So far, they’ve filed at least six complaints and want Harrell removed, he said.  Fernandez confirmed the school district has zeroed in on a property to replace Robb Elementary, which the district has said students will not return to, according to the Uvalde Hesperian report. Additionally, Fernandez said the district will approach fire drills differently, using the intercom system instead of sirens, the paper reported. CNN has reached out to the school district and the Texas Department of Public Safety for confirmation and comment, and has not immediately heard back. Following the massacre, a report from a Texas House Investigative Committee identified widespread failures across responding law enforcement agencies during the shooting. The report also concluded Arredondo failed to assume his responsibility as the on-scene commander during the incident. Responding officers arrived at the school within minutes of the shooter entering the building on May 24, but it took more than an hour for law enforcement to enter the adjoining classrooms and kill the gunman, according to a timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). “At Robb Elementary, law enforcement responders failed to adhere to their active shooter training, and they failed to prioritize saving the lives of innocent victims over their own safety,” the report said, adding, “The void of leadership could have contributed to the loss of life as injured victims waited over an hour for help, and the attacker continued to sporadically fire his weapon.” Arredondo has resisted officials’ statements identifying him as the leading officer, saying he “was responding as a police officer” and did not consider himself to be in charge. However, video footage from body-worn cameras and security cameras shows officers on the scene deferring to Arredondo when they are unsure of their role during the shooting and also shows Arredondo giving orders and coordinating personnel, according to a CNN analysis of the footage. On Wednesday, a Travis County judge denied state Sen. Roland Gutierrez’s request to force the DPS to release more records related to the shooting, saying it wasn’t properly submitted. Gutierrez told CNN he intends to appeal the ruling.   CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe, Rebekah Riess and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.

262,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/philbin-subpoena/,"The former deputy counsel to President Donald Trump has been subpoenaed in the federal criminal probe of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Patrick Philbin was subpoenaed for testimony and documents, according to one of the sources. Philbin worked in the White House counsel’s office under Pat Cipollone, who also was also subpoenaed for documents and testimony, according to sources. Philbin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Executive privilege will play a role in the discussions over Philbin’s grand jury testimony, as it has with recent grand jury testimony of Cipollone and vice presidential advisers Marc Short and Greg Jacob. Philbin and Cipollone were both key witnesses to Trump’s actions in the last days of his presidency. Cipollone repeatedly pushed back on efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and according to a Senate Judiciary Committee report, he and Philbin opposed a proposal to replace the attorney general with someone willing to look into false claims of election fraud. The report said that both Philbin and Cipollone indicated that they would resign should such a plan be executed. Philbin has already testified about the Capitol attack in a separate probe: earlier this year he appeared before the House select committee investigating January 6, CNN previously reported.  During Cipollone’s own testimony before the House committee, he told investigators that on January 6 he was joined by a number of top Trump advisers – including Philbin – in pushing the former President to issue a strong condemnation of the attack. CNN reported last October that Philbin was at the time among a cadre of attorneys from the Trump White House or campaign still at work for the former-President and now focused on more narrow tasks, such as handling executive privilege discussions with the National Archives or communicating with potential ex-White House witnesses called to Capitol Hill.

579,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/opinions/kansas-abortion-vote-upends-politics-opinion-column-galant/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In “The Wizard of Oz,” a tornado sends Dorothy and her Kansas home spinning into the “Merry Old Land of Oz.” Last week it was what Politico called a “political earthquake” in Kansas that sent the national debate over abortion into a new phase with many unknowns. For decades, the anti-abortion movement worked to overturn the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a national right to abortion. But their long-sought goal, finally achieved in June, may turn out to be a case of “be careful what you wish for.” By a vote of 59% to 41%, the people of Kansas rejected an amendment to the state constitution that would have eliminated the right to an abortion. “It’s a huge victory for abortion rights,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “The result in Kansas confirms that Americans simply do not want an extreme anti-abortion movement regulating women’s bodies. Kansans have said what most Americans believe: abortion is an issue best left to women and their doctors.” But she added that this was a vote which should never have happened. “Fundamental rights – and it doesn’t get more fundamental than sovereignty over one’s own body – should not be up for a vote, even if the righteous side is likely to win,” Filipovic argued. Writing for Politico, John F. Harris suggested that the vote in Kansas, along with others that may follow, could scramble the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion overturning Roe. He may go down in history as the “the justice who facilitated a national consensus on behalf of abortion rights. Quite unintentionally, today’s hero of the ‘pro-life’ movement could end up being a giant of the ‘pro-choice’ movement.” Tuesday’s vote in Kansas, which “mirrors polling showing solid majorities of people supported leaving Roe v. Wade intact, suggests that opponents of legal abortion do better when the prospect of an abortion ban is hypothetical, while abortion-rights supporters do better when the issue is tangibly real,” wrote Harris. A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent, noted that “the overturning of Roe v. Wade has energized a previously demoralized Democratic base and could galvanize college educated suburban women in particular … If the GOP can’t win an abortion fight in Kansas, imagine the difficulty it will face in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.” “Coupled with Trump’s stolen election obsession, mass shootings and a growing number of extreme GOP candidates in competitive races, the unpopularity of the Roe decision may mitigate Democratic losses in November, despite vulnerabilities on a number of other fronts (namely, the economy).” Dent also faulted Democrats for running ads that backed extreme, election-denying candidates in the GOP primaries in the hope that Democratic candidates could more easily defeat them in the general election. In Michigan, “the courageous freshman Congressman Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump just days after being sworn into Congress, fell to an election-denying candidate, John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who was backed by the former President,” Dent wrote.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $300,000 on ads touting Gibbs’ “conservatism and fidelity to Trump,” wrote Dent. “I’m sure plenty of Democratic operatives are cackling over their success meddling in the GOP primary, but any smugness may turn into deep regret if Gibbs ends up prevailing in November. Those who play with fire often get burned.”  For more: Mary Ziegler and Elizabeth Sepper: The coming state-federal showdown over abortion  Aziza Ahmed and Ji Seon Song: Protecting patients’ privacy is paramount in time of uncertain abortion access  Nancy Pelosi drops in China fired off missiles, flew jets into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and called off talks with the US on issues such as climate change and military relations. The reason: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, which China sees as part of its territory. While Pelosi’s visit sparked apocalyptic warnings and fevered headlines, Taiwanese-American journalist Clarissa Wei wrote that the people of Taiwan are mostly unfazed. “What’s most frustrating about the reaction to Pelosi’s visit is not the prophetic declaration of imminent doom, but the expectation of fear and the surprise that follows when people realize that we aren’t all panicking in Taiwan – as if the calm we exude in light of unprecedented threats is a symptom of our ignorance of the facts before us.” “Threats from China are nothing new. They have been a part of my life, my parents’ lives and their parents’ lives for as long as almost anyone in my family can remember. In fact, Taiwan has been under threat by the People’s Republic of China for nearly 70 years. The three Taiwan Strait crises are proof of that.”  Alex Jones   A Texas jury ordered incendiary radio host Alex Jones to pay a combined $49.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting 10 years ago. Jones’ legal troubles aren’t over by any means: he faces two more such trials.     One of the parents, Scarlett Lewis, even had to testify that her son “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom.” “It’s an unthinkable statement for a grief-stricken parent to have to make,” wrote Nicole Hemmer, “testifying that her 6-year-old son, murdered while he sat in school, had actually lived, and that she was the woman who had given birth to him and raised him for the too-few years he was alive. But that was the testimony Scarlett Lewis gave this week at a hearing to determine damages against Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and media personality.” “After 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jones began to spin lurid conspiracies that the shootings never happened and that the shattered families were simply actors. The conspiracy triggered years of harassment as conspiracists targeted the mourning parents, who have had to hire security to protect themselves.”  But as Hemmer noted, Jones is not a lone fringe player in the media world. He is “part of the right-wing power structure, from his interviews with soon-to-be president Donald Trump to his alleged role as an organizer at the January 6 insurrection.” “More than that, many in the Republican Party and conservative movement increasingly sound like Jones, with talk of false flags, crisis actors and pedophile rings now a mainstay of right-wing rhetoric. And while the Trump presidency opened the door for the mainstreaming of Jones, it’s important to understand how ripe the GOP was for Alex Jonesification.” In Dallas, the Conservative Political Action Conference gave a warm welcome to Hungary’s autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban.  “The audience cheered him on during his blistering attacks on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and more,” Julian Zelizer observed. “The illiberal and anti-democratic elements of Republican politics, which flared during the Trump presidency, are alive and well. As Orban’s popularity indicates, the profoundly anti-democratic strains that have been shaping the GOP keep getting stronger, not weaker…” “The talk comes on the same week that several election deniers, as well as participants in the January 6 insurrection, won in the primaries. The assault on the 2020 election continues to be a unifying theme in Republican circles. Even if some Republican voters are tiring of Trump, his rallying cry animates much of the electorate.”  Terrorist leader killed  Eleven years after then-President Barack Obama announced the killing of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in a US raid, President Joe Biden described the tracking down and elimination of bin Laden’s former associate, Ayman al-Zawahiri.  “The airstrike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri over the weekend in Afghanistan is part of the long and justified campaign by the United States to bring all the heads of the terror group to justice,” wrote Peter Bergen.  Still, some of the claims about al-Zawahiri’s impact were overblown. “While Zawahiri was influential in the very early years of al Qaeda in turning bin Laden against the regimes in the Middle East, he wasn’t involved in bin Laden’s most important strategic decisions – that is, turning him against the US and planning 9/11. And Zawahiri proved to be an incompetent leader of al Qaeda when he took over the group more than a decade ago.” Bergen added, “Zawahiri was not a charismatic leader of al Qaeda in the mold of Osama bin Laden. Instead, he had all the charisma of a boring uncle given to long, arcane monologues, someone that you would best avoid sitting next to at Thanksgiving dinner.”  Families in turmoil Guy Reffitt was sentenced to more than seven years in prison, the longest penalty meted out so far to insurrectionists who took part in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. His son Jackson Reffitt had reported his father to the FBI on Christmas Eve 2020.  “The Reffitts’ story is tragic, but hardly unique,” observed SE Cupp. “Chances are, you probably do know someone who’s been sucked into the cult of Trumpism, as Guy was. “Maybe it’s an aunt or uncle posting about rigged elections on Facebook, spreading Trump’s lie that the election was stolen… “Maybe it’s a father, or a mother, or a brother, who’s gone down a QAnon rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, and is no longer attached to reality.” “The carnage from Trump’s divisive rhetoric, lies, and conspiracy theories is incalculable. Trumpism is a powerful drug, one that can even cause a father to threaten his own child. “This was, incidentally, all by design. Trump stoked the fears and grievances of his base, turned Americans against each other, spread lies and conspiracy theories, undermined our faith in democratic institutions – all so that he could keep his supporters rabid, angry, willing to do whatever he asked. And sadly, many of them did.” For more: Peggy Drexler: Loving your family even when they make horrible choices  Bill Russell and Nichelle Nichols On and off the field, Bill Russell was a leader. On and off the screen, Nichelle Nichols was an inspirational role model. Both died last weekend. Peniel Joseph recalled Russell’s contributions as an athlete and a crusader against racism. “Russell was a 6-foot-10 center whose defensive prowess, rebounding skills and all-around leadership propelled the Celtics to 11 titles in 13 years,” Joseph wrote. “As if appearing in a news reel of the most significant events of the civil rights era, he was present, time and again, at key moments for the movement, from the March on Washington in 1963 to his visit to Mississippi that same year following the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers…” “Over the years, he never lost his willingness to call out racism, or a perceived indifference to it. In recent years, he chided White Americans for their incredulity – in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder and the racial and political reckoning that followed – about the existence of systemic racism.”  When “Star Trek” premiered in 1966, one of the cast members “was the cool, sultry, supremely self-possessed Lt. Nyota Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols, still a relative newcomer to television,” Gene Seymour recalled. In an era when the civil rights movement achieved its biggest successes, Nichols’ role had a symbolic significance. Yet “she was discouraged by her lines being cut from some of the episodes and was ready to move on to the Broadway stage. And she would have left if she hadn’t met a die-hard ‘Trek’ fan at an NAACP fundraiser in Hollywood: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.” King “told her that he and his family enjoyed watching ‘Trek’ and rooted for her playing a non-stereotypical Black character. She thanked him but said she was on her way out,” Seymour wrote. “‘You cannot and must not!’” Nichols recalled King saying in her autobiography. “’Don’t you realize how important your presence, your character is? Don’t you see? This is not a Black role, and this is not a female role… You have broken ground. For the first time, the world sees us as we should be seen, as equals, as intelligent people – as we should be.’” Nichols stayed with the show for its remaining two seasons and later would embrace “her importance as an inspiration and role model for young Black people whose dreams of space science and travel were emboldened by her character’s futuristic adventures.”  Don’t miss   Dean Obeidallah: There’s a good reason Jon Stewart is angry at Ted Cruz Kara Alaimo: What petrifies me about sending my kids to school this year David A.

And even more impressive, getting them to make changes in their work. Yet Hannah Diviney, a disability activist in Australia, accomplished just that.

Both artists soon responded and revised their songs’ lyrics.  “Words matter,” Diviney wrote. “They always have and they always will. Language is one of the few tools in the world most people can wield with ease and on social media even more so. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to how we use it. That’s why my mom always taught me the pen was mightier than the sword. If anything, this week has taught me that thanks to social media and the power of a well-crafted tweet, we have access to the mightiest pens of all.

297,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/primary-election-results-arizona-michigan-missouri-2022/,"Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump last year, has lost to a fervent election denier running with Trump’s support, CNN projected early Wednesday.  Republicans in Michigan and Arizona – two states at the center of Trump’s 2020 election denial campaign – voted on Tuesday in primaries for crucial federal and state contests as the shape of the 2022 midterms comes into focus less than a hundred days from Election Day.  Trump’s picks will win the GOP gubernatorial nod in Michigan as well as the GOP nominations for US Senate, secretary of state and attorney general in Arizona, CNN projects. In Arizona, one significant loss was that of state House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who delivered emotional testimony before the House January 6 committee about his resolve in the face of enormous pressure to overturn the 2020 results. He’ll lose a GOP state Senate primary, CNN projected early Wednesday.  Trump’s loss in those battleground states two years ago seeded right-wing anger and turned Republican primary campaigns up and down the ballot into referendums on his election lies. Allies of the former President sought offices crucial to the balance of power in Washington and in state governments, where the GOP is hoping to gain control of the election apparatus ahead of the 2024 presidential contest. With his loss to former Trump administration official John Gibbs, Meijer becomes the second of the so-called “impeachment 10” to lose reelection after South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice lost to a Trump-backed challenger in June.  Two others – Washington Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – were also facing challengers from their own party on Tuesday, but CNN has not yet projected whether they’ll be advancing to the general election. (Under Washington’s primary system, the top two finishers regardless of party advance to November.) Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, perhaps the most high-profile of the House Republicans to have voted for impeachment because of her role as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, faces a Trump-backed opponent later this month.  One of the impeachment 10 – California Rep. David Valadao – survived earlier this year, advancing to the November election in the Golden State’s top two system, while four of the Republicans who voted for impeachment are not running for reelection. Meijer’s primary in his western Michigan district had become a flashpoint in both parties’ national infighting because Gibbs was the beneficiary of Democratic meddling. The party’s House campaign arm, believing that Gibbs would be a less viable general election candidate, ran more than $300,000 in ads ostensibly attacking his alliance with Trump with the goal of boosting him in the primary. But that strategy angered some on the left who thought it undermined their broader messaging against political extremism in the GOP, while sparking fears the gamble could backfire if Gibbs makes it to Congress.  As CNN’s KFILE first reported in 2018, Gibbs has a history of conspiratorial and inflammatory tweets and defended a notorious anti-Semitic troll banned by Twitter. In Michigan’s gubernatorial primary, Trump-backed Tudor Dixon had the support of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and benefited from the disqualification of five would-be candidates after thousands of forged signatures were found on nominating petitions. A conservative commentator who had coalesced support from prominent Republicans in the state, Dixon beat back criticism that she was an establishment candidate who wasn’t “MAGA” enough. Dixon will be taking on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is seeking a second term. Whitmer is a key piece of the Democratic bulwark against Republican power in Michigan, where the GOP controls both legislative chambers.  Tuesday also provided voters with their first chance to directly respond to the US Supreme Court’s striking down of federal abortion rights earlier this summer – an issue that national Democrats hope will energize their base in the fall. Kansas voters have decided to maintain the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution by voting “no” on a proposed constitutional amendment, CNN projects. The procedure is currently legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas, where people from Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri have traveled for services amid Republican-led efforts to roll back abortion rights. Senate primaries will set crucial fall matchups   In Missouri, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt will win the GOP Senate nomination, CNN projects. His victory is a relief for national party leadership anxious that former Gov. Eric Greitens would win and then lose the general election in November. Greitens had resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct and more recently faced allegations of abuse from his ex-wife, which he has denied.   Schmitt and Greitens shared an 11th-hour endorsement from Trump, who said on Monday he was backing “Eric” and leaving it up to voters to decide which one, although both candidates immediately tried to claim the endorsement for themselves.  Echoing a pledge from Greitens, Schmitt – who was endorsed by Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah – said last week that he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for leader. While Trump hedged his bets, the state’s junior senator, Josh Hawley, suffered a loss after backing Rep. Vicky Hartzler. One of two members of Congress seeking the nomination, she was critical of Trump in the aftermath of January 6, but still voted against certifying the presidential vote and touted her voting record with Trump on the trail.  In Arizona, Blake Masters, an acolyte of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel who was Trump’s pick in that race, won the Republicans’ nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in November, CNN projects.  A proxy war between Trump and Pence The race to succeed term-limited Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey split the party, with Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence endorsing Karrin Taylor Robson and Trump backing former television reporter Kari Lake, whose campaign was fueled by the former President’s election lies. Down the ballot in Arizona, Trump-backed election-denying state Rep. Mark Finchem, who attended the January 6, 2021, rally in Washington, will win the Republican nomination for Arizona Secretary of State, CNN projects. The Democratic primary for Arizona Secretary of State remains too early to call. And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN projects. Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs will win the Democratic nod for governor, CNN projects.  Moderate prevails in member vs. member primary  Besides the GOP drama in Michigan’s 3rd District, Meanwhile, in Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, Rep. Haley Stevens will defeat fellow Democratic Rep. Andy Levin, CNN projects, in a clash of incumbents that was the latest chapter of a proxy fight between moderates and progressives. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) had backed Stevens and its new super PAC, United Democracy Project, spent more than $4 million to boost her bid. UDP’s outlay, along with bundling by AIPAC, spurred another pro-Israel group, the liberal J Street, to jump in on Levin’s behalf, splashing $700,000 in a July ad buy for him.

414,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/opinions/monkeypox-stigma-healthcare-workers-das-kutscher/,"Editor’s Note: Lala Tanmoy (Tom) Das is an MD-PhD student at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Follow him @TanmoyDasLala. Eric Kutscher MD is an internal medicine physician and addiction medicine fellow at NYU Langone Health. Follow him @ekutscher. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. View more opinion on CNN. As monkeypox cases have skyrocketed in the US, predominantly among men who have sex with men, the stigma associated with it has also grown – including in the medical community.   A recent CNN investigation found that in the midst of rising case numbers, some phlebotomists in the US have refused to draw blood from patients with suspected monkeypox, preventing these patients from obtaining medically necessary and physician-ordered tests. Yet the definition of “suspected monkeypox” and the other details around these cases remain murky at best. As CNN noted in its reporting, it is unclear if the phlebotomists refused to perform blood draws, or whether company policy prohibited it. Are these encounters in which gay men are being denied bloodwork simply because they are gay and monkeypox is now associated with this demographic? Or are these situations in which patients with visible and infectious pustules are presenting to diagnostic testing sites where phlebotomists are worried about whether proper safety policies and procedures are in place?  In the first encounter, homophobia is the driving factor; in the second, any reasonable health care provider would similarly have reservations about putting themselves at risk. (Even though the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that virus levels in infected people’s blood are low, non-bloodborne transmission routes such as directly touching lesions may increase a health care worker’s possible risk of getting infected without adequate PPE.) We are gay men, and seeing those in our community denied medical care echoes the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Originally called GRID (gay related immunodeficiency), the outbreak resulted in discrimination and stigmatization of LGBTQ+ individuals across society regardless of infectious status.  It is discriminatory to assume that an identity is itself a risk factor for disease and that avoidance of complete segments of society is an appropriate safety mechanism. Yet these faulty assumptions remain the cornerstone of homophobia in modern day medicine and account for much of the mistrust that LGBTQ+ people have toward the health care system. But as medical professionals, we also understand the fear that comes with encountering patients who have highly infectious diseases. Eric has been a frontline physician since day one of the Covid-19 pandemic and is now a physician working with patients with monkeypox. Tom has worked with patients in the intensive care unit during the Delta Covid-19 surge. We understand the real fear of contracting viruses at work, and – as a married couple – we recognize the concern about bringing disease home to loved ones.  With the Covid-19 pandemic, we watched as guidelines on PPE changed out of convenience rather than out of scientific data and saw our coworkers – fellow doctors, nurses, phlebotomists, radiology technicians, janitorial staff, security – contract the virus from their patients.  No one goes into medicine to hurt patients – everyone in health care has decided to work in an industry that tries to improve the lives of others. Yet, it would be unconscionable to expect everyone in health care to put their own health at risk to help their patients. And coming off of the Covid-19 experience, there is justified mistrust and persistent fear among many health care personnel.  The way to ameliorate the situation at large – both to bolster the health and safety of health care workers and to address the stigmas associated with monkeypox – is twofold: education and proper safety policies including the provision of personal protective equipment.  Health care providers at all levels must be included in trainings about what monkeypox is, how it is spread (and how it isn’t) and mechanisms to keep themselves safe while caring for all patients – both those with monkeypox and those without. We must make it clear what safety procedures are necessary and ensure all providers have access to materials like PPE at all times.  We must allow each health care worker the chance to ask questions about how monkeypox impacts their job. As a medical community, we will more than likely identify lapses in our policies and ways to improve them.  Feeling protected is a key motivator for behavior change. We’ve seen the evolution in how we’ve interacted with, treated and dealt with HIV through the rise of universal precautions, aimed to protect health care workers. These precautions were introduced by the CDC in the 1980s in response to the HIV epidemic when a lot was unknown about the virus, and they include protocols for hand hygiene; wearing gloves, goggles and gowns; and specific transmission-route based precautions.  If followed properly, they can prevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens and other infectious materials. The availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and HIV treatment have even further decreased the fear around infection with HIV among health care providers.  Additionally, vaccines to prevent monkeypox, like Jynneos, are hard to find and must first go to patients at highest risk of disease. The CDC advises people who are exposed to monkeypox through their jobs, such as clinical laboratory personnel who perform diagnostic tests, to get the vaccine as a pre-exposure prophylaxis, and some health care workers who were exposed to patients with monkeypox have gotten the vaccine as a post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent illness or mitigate symptoms. But supplies are still low, and once the vaccines are more readily available, they should be offered as a pre-exposure prophylaxis to a broader range of health care workers, from nurses to hospital staff to technicians – all of whom may encounter patients with monkeypox. Labcorp executive Dr. Brian Caveney told CNN last week that some of their phlebotomists “have been scared” of monkeypox. Without specific information on what exactly is driving these phlebotomists to refuse blood draws, shaming health care workers for being afraid (despite potentially lacking PPE and updated information on monkeypox) or assuming that it stems exclusively from homophobia, feels a little myopic. As case numbers are projected to climb and the future of the monkeypox outbreak remains uncertain, careful messaging, knowledge sharing and destigmatizing should be our collective priority.  Health care workers must feel heard and protected, as many of us are exhausted, fearful and burnt out from working nonstop through more than two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. But that cannot mean we overlook the needs of our gay, bisexual, queer and transgender patients – an already stigmatized group jaded from decades of minority stress.

Hucksters flourish online, where pushing lies and conspiracy theories can make millions and cultivate followings. But alternate realities do not stand up to cross-examination, as Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, is learning in a Texas courtroom, where he’s being confronted with his lies about murdered children. Not only did the jury order him to pay $4 million in compensatory damages on Thursday for pushing a conspiracy theory about the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, but his legal team had apparently accidentally handed over two years of his text messages to the plaintiffs’ attorney.  Now the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection wants access, perhaps to fact-check Jones’ brag that he financed the rally that day. It is his most loathsome lie, about Sandy Hook, for which Jones will first have to pay. The jury award is less than the $150 million originally sought by the parents of a Sandy Hook victim, but Jones could be ordered to pay more as part of a punitive portion of the proceedings and also potentially in two other lawsuits brought by different Sandy Hook parents in Texas and Connecticut. Read the news report from CNN’s Oliver Darcy. Facing victims. Jones broadcast repeatedly that the Sandy Hook massacre – which killed 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-olds – was a hoax and that parents who lost children were actors. So it had to be uncomfortable for Jones to sit in court and hear Scarlett Lewis tell him this week about her dead son. “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom,” she said. See CNN’s full report on that testimony. Too late. Jones has publicly accepted the truth that Sandy Hook was “100% real,” but only now that his failure to cooperate with the court resulted in a default judgment. He’s previously said a “form of psychosis” made him dream up the conspiracy theory. Insulting judge and jury. His company has sought bankruptcy protection ahead of the jury’s deliberation, and his fate is in the hands of jurors he’s characterized as “blue collar” and a judge his company has falsely said helped pedophiles. The judge upbraided him for lying in court when he stood as the only witness for his defense. He told jurors that his previous lies and insults about them on his show were untrue. “I don’t think that you are operatives,” he said at one point. “I don’t think that you are part of a false flag. I don’t think that you are bad people. I think you’re good people. And I just am very, very critical about the whole process.” Caught in a lie. Jones had testified his text messages did not mention Sandy Hook. After his lawyer inadvertently shared a digital copy of the contents of Jones’ cellphone, the lawyer for two Sandy Hook parents said the text messages show that Jones lied. For a good idea of how slippery and slick Jones can be, watch his expressions during this 2017 interview with NBC News in which he never actually admits Sandy Hook occurred, and where he is asked about his ability to inspire Donald Trump. This is his schtick. For an objective look at the facts, read this excellent and in-depth, multipart report from CNN’s Rob Kuznia. Key lines: “With the verbal fluidity of a great talk show host and the excitable charisma of a televangelist, the hard-charging, gravelly voiced Jones has perfected the WWE-ification of the news: It looks professional, but is far from real. If the object of an actual news show is to inform viewers in a compelling way, the object of Infowars is to whip up the ever-dormant flames of populist fear and resentment in service of going viral – without a thought to who gets hurt or who is driven to violence. It’s doom-porn, and the name of the game is to get eyeballs and sell products.” And this: “His tried-and-true schtick has been to declare or strongly imply that high-profile tragedies – from the 9/11 terror attacks to the Boston Marathon bombing to the Sandy Hook massacre to the latest horrific mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas – were nefarious government plots aimed at tightening control over Americans.” Where lies don’t work. But free speech has limits in court, where lies can be punished as defamation, or worse, perjury, if the lies continue on the witness stand. “Over the past few years, we’ve seen federal and state courts stand strong as a bulwark of truth,” CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, told me in an email.  “Whether it’s Alex Jones or Rudy Giuliani or a 2020 election denier, it’s one thing to spout conspiracy theories on a podcast or social media, but courts demand actual facts and evidence. And, importantly, courts can and will impose accountability and punish people who spread lies for illegal purposes,” Honig said. Jones and January 6. CNN’s Drew Griffin has a special report,  “Megaphone for Conspiracy: the Alex Jones Story,” which will re-air on Friday at 11 p.m. ET. During an appearance on CNN on Thursday, Griffin explained why the January 6 committee would want Jones’ text messages. “Alex Jones, based on our reporting and based on Alex Jones’ bragging, quite frankly, said he was very much involved in financing or getting financing for Donald Trump’s rally on the Ellipse that day,” Griffin said. “He was also very instrumental in promoting the idea of a January 6th gathering in Washington.” Ties to Oath Keepers. Griffin also noted that Jones frequently featured Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder facing federal seditious conspiracy charges, on Infowars. Rhodes has pleaded not guilty.  In Griffin’s special report, he tracks video of Jones during the insurrection, as Jones led a march from the Ellipse toward the east side of the Capitol. In the meantime, rioters attacked the west side.  Jones soon left the protest to broadcast for Infowars and was among the first to argue, falsely, that the insurrection was being led by Antifa rather than Trump supporters. “It’s the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt,” said CNN anchor Chris Wallace on “New Day” on Thursday. “Speak loudly and carry a little stick.” “He walked his people right up to the edge of the Capitol, right up the east front of the Capitol … and they all go in and they all face the charges and they all face the police, and he goes back to his perch and oversees it and starts talking about Antifa.” About the election lie. Here’s the turn from Jones and his accountability for Sandy Hook lies and potential accountability for election lies. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon refused to cooperate with Congress in the January 6 inquiry, and now he’s facing jail time. Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani will testify later this month before a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury that’s investigating Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election. There has also been movement at the Justice Department, where the January 6 investigation has taken testimony from former White House officials in recent days. Still promising accountability. Attorney General Merrick Garland was asked recently by NBC News if he would be concerned about tearing the country apart by indicting Trump if Trump were to run for president again. “We intend to hold everyone – anyone – who is criminally responsible for the events surrounding January 6, or any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another, accountable,” Garland said. “That’s what we do. We don’t pay any attention to other issues with respect to that.” This story has been updated with additional developments.",Stewart Rhodes;Alex Jone;Drew Griffin;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Scarlett Lewis;Elie Honig;Rudy Giuliani;Rudy Giuliani;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Rob Kuznia;Teddy Roosevelt,White House;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TRIAL,468;TRIAL,1660;TRIAL,1724;TRIAL,6478;ELECTION,4304;ELECTION,6102;ELECTION,6228;ELECTION,6540;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,431;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1156;TAX_FNCACT_FOUNDER,318;TAX_FNCACT_FOUNDER,5231;",White House;Fulton County;Sandy Hook;Boston;Americans;Georgia;Washington;New York;Texas;Uvalde,1607
433,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/illinois-day-care-monkeypox,"An Illinois day-care worker has tested positive for monkeypox, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced Friday, but no other cases have been reported there. “An adult at a day-care center in the Rantoul area has tested positive for a case of monkeypox,” department Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said at a news briefing. “Screening of children and other staff is taking place now.” Officials did not say how many children might have been exposed to the virus. The worker is in isolation and is “doing well.” The day-care center has also been cleaned. Vohra said the US Food and Drug Administration has made the monkeypox vaccine available for the children “without jumping through the normal hoops in this process,” so parents of children exposed to the virus can get their kids vaccinated.  “Pediatricians are on-site as we speak to screen children for cases, and there are mobile testing and vaccines for their families,” he said. The day-care worker also works in home health care, and public health officials are in contact with an affected client. Public health officials asked parents to let disease investigators contact them if their child is affected. “If your child has had the potential of being exposed to this outbreak, you will receive a call from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. You do not need to call day-care centers. You do not need to call public health. You will be contacted,” said Julie Pryde, administrator of the district.  Monkeypox spreads primarily through extended skin-on-skin contact or through contact with contaminated items.  Some cases in the United States have been reported in women and children in the ongoing outbreak, but the virus has been predominantly found in gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men. There are more than 7,500 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in the United States as of Friday afternoon, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Sameer Vohra;Julie Pryde,Champaign-Urbana Public Health District;Us Centers For Disease;Drug Administration;Illinois Department Of Public Health;United States;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,298;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1113;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1921;WB_1406_DISEASES,1113;WB_1406_DISEASES,1921;HEALTH_VACCINATION,639;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,639;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,639;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,639;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,639;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1155;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1184;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,27;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,487;TAX_FNCACT_WORKER,959;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1942;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1942;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1942;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1942;WB_2026_PREVENTION,1942;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,104;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1008;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1074;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1306;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1395;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,104;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1008;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1074;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1306;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1395;GENERAL_HEALTH,104;GENERAL_HEALTH,985;GENERAL_HEALTH,1008;GENERAL_HEALTH,1074;GENERAL_HEALTH,1306;GENERAL_HEALTH,1395;MEDICAL,104;MEDICAL,985;MEDICAL,1008;MEDICAL,1074;MEDICAL,1306;MEDICAL,1395;AFFECT,1050;AFFECT,1167;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1641;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1240;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,1676;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1240;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1676;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1240;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1676;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1240;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1676;TAX_FNCACT_ADMINISTRATOR,1453;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,593;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,593;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,593;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,593;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,593;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,593;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1127;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,61;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,276;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,631;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1482;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1829;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,990;LGBT,1726;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,408;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1018;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1084;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,362;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,438;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,666;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,748;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,858;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1652;",Illinois;Rantoul;United States,396
440,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/entertainment/jane-austen-adaptations-persuasion-fire-island-cec/,"It’s an act braver than marrying for love, riskier than running away with Mr. Wickham and plainer than Anne Elliot to adapt Jane Austen’s beloved, essential books for the screen.  And yet, filmmakers keep trying.  There are the modern retellings – “Clueless,” which dropped its Emma Woodhouse in Beverly Hills and dressed her in Alaïa, and this summer’s “Fire Island,” a version of “Pride and Prejudice” with gay protagonists. There are those that stick closely to the text, like Whit Stillman’s uproarious “Love and Friendship” and the 1995 “Pride and Prejudice” miniseries that turned a generation of viewers into Colin Firth-as-Darcy diehards.  Make a so-so adaptation and you risk the wrath of Austen’s legions of readers: Take “Persuasion,” which caused a massive stink before it was even released in July when its trailer included snippets of new, modernized dialogue that chopped down Austen’s original text and “Fleabag”-esque camera-mugging.  It’s an unenviable task, condensing volumes’ worth of social critique, sparkling dialogue and characters so beloved that they’ve inspired an entire archetype of love interest. But often, these films succeed and even reveal new layers to Austen’s canonical works. At the very least, they inspire debate among her many readers. CNN consulted several Austen scholars and devotees to explain what they look for in an adaptation of Austen’s work – and break down why the magic of her words can be so tricky to translate for the screen. Why we love adapting Austen Viewed one way, Austen’s tales are quintessential romances. They’ve got all the hallmarks of the genre: Disapproving family, mismatched couples, hate-to-love relationships, long-awaited reunions, swoon-worthy declarations of love.  We’ve seen these tropes crop up in nearly every romance story since. So what makes Austen’s romances so ripe for retelling? On one hand, it’s a shrewd business decision to revive Austen – there’s always an audience for her work, said Jillian Davis and Yolanda Rodriguez, hosts of the “Pemberley Podcast,” in which they analyze various adaptations of Austen’s work.   “Complex interpersonal relationships will never go out of style,” Davis and Rodriguez told CNN in an email.  Over the years, Austen adaptations have made millions, been nominated for more than a dozen Oscars and several Emmys, and convinced viewers the world over that Mr. Darcy is the gold standard of suitors. The ’90s gave us a boom of Austen adaptations – the Firth-starring “Pride and Prejudice,” “Emma” with Gwyneth Paltrow, “Sense and Sensibility” with Emma Thompson to name a few – and other Regency-era stories, similar to what we have now amid the enormous popularity of “Bridgerton.” Austen’s popularity spans the world – see the Bollywood-inspired film “Bride & Prejudice” and China’s “Mr. Pride vs. Miss Prejudice,” two of several Austen adaptations starring Asian protagonists.   Though Austen’s novels always folded love and marriage into their plots, the author didn’t always portray marriage as the seamless happy ending to which her heroines aspired. It’s a financial decision and a familial duty, of which her female characters are acutely aware. Austen’s women are often ambivalent about what it would mean for their independence if they marry, even when they genuinely love their partners, said Inger Brodey, an associate professor of English and comparative literature at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  “Austen is a way for today’s readers to both romanticize about soul mates and also sustain their self-respect,” said Brodey, who’s published several papers on Austen. And so, in that way, she said, Austen’s tales continue to inspire and empower today: They’re clear-eyed love stories told from a subtly feminist perspective that still give their protagonists some sort of agency. What the best Austen adaptations get right A strong Austen adaptation doesn’t need to parrot the original text or even take place in late 18th-century England. In fact, Brodey said, she’d prefer a film not feel indebted to the source novel. The Austenites CNN interviewed agreed – for an Austen adaptation to succeed, it needs to maintain the spirit of her work, especially her incisive depth and incomparable wit. “What’s most challenging for any adapter of Austen must be capturing her fiction’s incredible combination of comedy, irony and social criticism, along with genuinely moving stories of courtship,” said Devoney Looser, a Regents professor of English at Arizona State University and author of “The Making of Jane Austen.” “It’s obviously hard to get that balance of characters in content in two hours, along with the requisite, satisfying happy endings.” “I’d say I find any adaptation of Austen to be a successful one if it gets me thinking, or rethinking, any parts of the original,” Looser told CNN.  Take the seemingly divergent but thematically faithful “Clueless,” a ’90s retelling of “Emma.” It’s not an obvious candidate for most accurate Austen adaptation (the lead’s name is Cher, for one, and her closet comes with software that helps her coordinate outfits), but both Brody and Austen scholar William Galperin said Amy Heckerling’s film is an exemplary version of a film that modernizes elements of the story while retaining Austen’s spirit.   “Clueless” is “celebrating a certain kind of autonomy and playfulness and solidarity among women,” the kind that Austen took seriously, too, said William Galperin, an English professor at Rutgers University and author of “The Historical Austen.” And like “Emma,” “Clueless” is more concerned with Cher’s development than her romantic escapades, and even those plotlines serve to strengthen her character.  Films that update, modernize or otherwise remix Austen for a new time, place or culture are, paradoxically, “more able to reveal new aspects of Austen than films that try to follow her novels more slavishly,” Brodey said. Even “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” though anything but subtle, found a parallel between “settling down” and zombiism. But aside from the rare battle between Bennets and the undead, Austen’s stories mine narrative riches out of relatively mundane goings-on at English manors, among members of a few local families.  “What (Austen) is trying to suggest on the largest scale is that what goes on in the everyday basis of all of our lives is filled with all kinds of implications,” Galperin said. “It doesn’t have to involve big things like fights and power struggles on a grand sort of geopolitical level. Ordinary, everyday life is filled with all kinds of complexities. And the closer the films come to representing that, the better they are.” Where Austen adaptations fall short Condensing hundreds of pages of rich text – rife with social critique, gorgeous phrasing and revelatory inner musings – into a two-hour film or even a six-hour miniseries is no small feat. So, Galperin said, some filmmakers focus on the most obvious strand in the story: The marriage plot.  Relationships are of course important in Austen’s novels, but more often, Galperin said, the marriage plot is the mere “scaffolding,” a skeleton of a story. The meat, he said, is in the narrative episodes that reveal her characters’ true intentions.   Some adaptations – like the most recent “Persuasion,” according to many critics – lack the ambivalence and depth present in Austen’s books. “Persuasion” is a story of a “second chance at love” between unmarried Anne Elliot (played in the latest version by Dakota Johnson, whose “bloom” has decidedly not “vanished early”) and her one-time partner Captain Wentworth. But it’s also concerned with familial duty, conformity and precious independence, and those themes, at least on screen, often come second to romance. “The novel is extremely good at demonstrating that tension (between love and duty), whereas the film just kind of flattens that into an early rejection,” Galperin said. Often, Brodey said, films “overwhelmingly indulge in romance at the expense of social satire.” Why Austen’s stories will live forever Even if new versions of “Persuasion” and other classics aren’t necessarily successful in reinterpreting Austen’s work, they’re still worth making, Looser said – at the very least, they’ll entice new audiences to fall for the brooding Darcy, the beachside bliss of Sanditon and the cunningly resourceful Lady Susan. “If we don’t recreate Austen’s nineteenth-century stories for our own time, and attract new generations of viewers, then these texts won’t live on,” Looser said. “So I’m definitely all for adaptations that use Austen’s material as an inspiration, and make their own mark on it, rather than treating her originals as blueprints that must be religiously copied.”   And continuing to spin new yarns out of Austen’s original work opens up her world to figures her books didn’t represent, including people of color and LGBTQ protagonists. “Fire Island” uses the loose framework of “Pride and Prejudice” to tell a story about two Asian American gay men, the racism and classism they experience from White gay men and the relationships they forge in spite of that hatred. Both “Sanditon” and “Persuasion” cast people of color in Austen’s world, set in an era in which racism was codified (a decision that’s inspired debate, since these projects often don’t address racism within their fictional world).  There are a million ways to tell an Austenian tale today: Plop its plot into present day, break the fourth wall or give the Bennet sisters swords to dispatch zombies (to varied critical reception). It’s impossible to please every Austen fan, but scholars and readers say that as long as an adaptation of Austen retains what makes her work so beloved in the first place – intelligence, irony and, yes, “capital-R romance” – it will almost always find an audience willing to fall in love.",Jillian Davis;Anne Elliot;Anne Elliot;Gwyneth Paltrow;Scottie Andrew;William Galperin;William Galperin;Yolanda Rodriguez;Emma Woodhouse;Jane Austen;Jane Austen;Jane Austen;Jane Austen;Jane Austen;Inger Brodey;Lady Susan;Beverly Hills;Beverly Hills;Beverly Hills;Whit Stillman;Amy Heckerling;Dakota Johnson;Emma Thompson,Rutgers University;University Of North Carolina;English At Arizona State University;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,3465;TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,4574;TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,5786;TAX_ETHNICITY_ENGLISH,6486;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,3465;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,4574;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,5786;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ENGLISH,6486;DISCRIMINATION_RACE_RACISM,9736;DISCRIMINATION_RACE_RACISM,9934;DISCRIMINATION_RACE_RACISM,10028;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,5027;EDUCATION,3454;EDUCATION,4563;EDUCATION,5796;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,3454;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,4563;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,5796;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2985;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,9706;TAX_FNCACT_LADY,8859;TAX_FNCACT_BRIDE,2889;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHER,5085;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHER,5903;TAX_FNCACT_SCHOLAR,5194;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,9715;AFFECT,7226;ARMEDCONFLICT,6372;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,3279;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,5705;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_CAPTAIN,8100;TAX_FNCACT_CAPTAIN,8100;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,3082;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,4611;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,5827;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1948;PROTEST,8304;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3508;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,4602;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,5818;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,7300;WB_135_TRANSPORT,5432;WB_135_TRANSPORT,5568;DISCRIMINATION,482;DISCRIMINATION,628;DISCRIMINATION,2635;DISCRIMINATION,2899;DISCRIMINATION,2936;DISCRIMINATION,6251;DISCRIMINATION,9335;DISCRIMINATION,9451;DISCRIMINATION,9676;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,482;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,628;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2635;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2899;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2936;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,6251;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,9335;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,9451;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,9676;WB_2936_GOLD,2533;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2533;WB_895_MINING_SYSTEMS,2533;WB_1699_METAL_ORE_MINING,2533;TAX_FNCACT_SCHOLARS,1376;TAX_FNCACT_SCHOLARS,5362;TAX_FNCACT_SCHOLARS,5498;TAX_FNCACT_SCHOLARS,10308;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6423;LGBT,491;LGBT,9719;LGBT,9778;TAX_FNCACT_FEMINIST,3846;",Arizona;American;China,2180
266,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/americas/anibal-torres-peru-resignation-intl/,"Peruvian Prime Minister Anibal Torres Vasquez has abruptly resigned, becoming the fourth premier to leave the job in the past year. Torres announced his resignation in a letter to President Pedro Castillo on Wednesday, attributing his decision to “personal reasons” and wishing his “friend” Castillo success.  “I retire from this position after having served alongside you, our homeland (and) particularly the put-off and forgotten people,” said Torres’ letter, which he posted on Twitter. By Peruvian law, Castillo must accept or reject his resignation.  Castillo told local media on Thursday that a new cabinet will be sworn in on Friday.  “From today I will make some decisions regarding the Cabinet, tomorrow, we are going to swear in this Cabinet, and I hope it will be a Cabinet that follows our call….. Let’s create a broad-based Cabinet to work for Peru,” Castillo said while being constantly interrupted by reporters.   Torres, whose tenure lasted almost 6 months, announced his resignation almost a week after President Castillo marked one year in power.  He accepted the role in February, after former Prime Minister Hector Valer stepped down amid allegations of domestic violence against him.  Valer, who had been in office just for four days, denied the allegations.   Torres’ resignation now comes as Castillo himself is under pressure to resign by the opposition. Castillo is currently the subject of five investigations, four of them for alleged corruption. On Thursday, Castillo went to the prosecutor’s office along with his legal team to testify on one of those allegations. Castillo has previously admitted he had made mistakes and said he was willing to cooperate with any investigation. “I present myself to justice in order to clarify the charges that are attributed to me , with respect to the due process and not to media justice,” Castillo said during a speech before Congress celebrating Peru’s National Day on July 28. According to Peru’s constitution, a sitting president may only be impeached on four charges: treason; preventing presidential, regional or local elections; dissolving Congress; or blocking the work of the National Election Jury or other electoral bodies.

644,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/child-gun-deaths-georgia-maryland/,"Two children have died, one 4 years old and one 15, in two separate accidental gun shootings by children in the past two days.  In Georgia, a mother has been charged with cruelty to children after her 4-year-old daughter found a loaded gun in the backseat of a vehicle and shot and killed herself Sunday evening, police said. Police responding to a call of a person shot on I-85 in metro Atlanta found 4-year-old Kendal Lewis deceased in the backseat, apparently from a gun shot, according to a release from DeKalb County Police Department.   The child’s mother, Kaelin Lewis, was driving when her daughter found a firearm in the backseat and discharged it, shooting herself, police said.  Kaelin was arrested and faces a charge of cruelty to children in the second degree, according to police.  CNN has not been able to determine if Lewis has an attorney. She is currently in the custody of the DeKalb County jail, according to jail logs.    In the second incident, a 9-year-old boy fatally shot a 15-year-old girl in Maryland Saturday while he was playing with a gun and it accidentally went off, according to Baltimore police. The gun belongs to a relative of the boy who works as an armed security guard, police said.  Due to state law, the boy cannot be charged with a crime, police said, and the investigation is ongoing.   Police are working with the state attorney’s office for any possible charges related to the shooting, the Baltimore Police Department said in a release posted on Facebook.

359,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/health/baby-formula-shortage-update/,"About a month ago, Vicki Hankins and her husband were putting serious miles on their car while hunting for baby formula. Now, instead of long drives every few days with uncertain results, they’ve been able to cut down to one long trip only once or twice a month. They don’t worry any more about being able to find formula – they just know they’ll have to travel to get it. Experts who are closely tracking the state of the ongoing baby formula shortage in the United States say stories like the Hankinses’ are par for the course right now. Formula availability is not back to normal, but for many families, it’s better than it was even a month or two ago. Before a nationwide infant formula recall by Abbott Nutrition in February and the subsequent shutdown of one of the company’s major manufacturing plants, about 10% of infant formula products were typically out of stock, according to market research firm Information Resources Inc., known as IRI.  IRI’s latest report says about 20% of all types of baby formula products were out of stock during the week ending July 24 – the lowest out-of-stock rate since early June. Stock rates for powdered formula have been slower to recover. IRI data shows that about 30% of powdered formula products were out of stock the week ending July 24. “There’s no question that the situation where families are going into the store and finding absolutely no formula has gotten much better,” said Dr. Steve Abrams, a neonatologist at the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. “On the other hand, there are significant problems still in the system.” The US Food and Drug Administration commissioner said last week that formula production needs to continue at high levels for six to eight more  weeks for supply to keep up with demand. Programs designed to help families affected by the shortage are being extended, too. Back in May, Abbott announced that in states where it held WIC contracts, it would cover the cost of switching babies to different brands through August 30 – a signal that it expected the shortage could impact consumers for months. Then in June, flooding from a storm again halted operations at Abbott’s Sturgis, Michigan, facility, delaying its production ramp up. The Abbott plant is producing specialty Elecare formula again – and shipping could begin “imminently” – but the company has extended its rebates to states for another month. Families who depended on certain formulas have already had to pivot to find new ways to feed their babies, and they may still have to use different formula brands, travel long distances to find it and adhere to stores’ buying limits. The Hankins’ 9-month-old son, Orrin, is allergic to ingredients in standard baby formula and needs a hypoallergenic variety. He had been on Similac Alimentum, which is made by Abbott. By June, they were no longer able to find it in stores.  They could order it online, but it wasn’t covered by benefits through Virginia’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children, or WIC. When they got it from retailers like Walmart.com, they had to pay for it out of pocket – an expense that strained the family’s budget. So, in July, Hankins worked with her state WIC program to switch her son to a different brand of hypoallergenic formula called Gerber Good Start Extensive HA, which is being flown into the US from the Netherlands. It’s one of several overseas brands being sold in the United States since the shortage began.  Orrin had struggled to switch formula in the past, but he did great, Hankins said. Still, the family travels about two hours round-trip from their home in Prince George County to get to stores that carry Orrin’s new formula. But Hankins said she can always find the right one. On their last trip, they found it at Kroger and Publix stores right next to each other and bought the maximum allowed: four cans at one store and three cans at the other. “We got to use our WIC benefits for the month in one trip, which was great,” Hankins said. “If I’m only doing that once or twice a month instead of every couple days, it really is such an improvement.” Vulnerable families still hit hard For families who can be flexible with the brands or types of formula they buy or the amount they can afford to pay, the shortage has eased considerably. But for others, the pain continues.  Hypoallergenic and easy-to-digest formulas are still in very short supply, and Abrams said families that need them face hardships. Hospital dietitians are scrambling to track them down for families. As soon as they find a formula that a baby can tolerate, it may run out before it’s even delivered to the family’s home. Then the process of prescribing and ordering starts all over again.  Families that depend on WIC program benefits have more limited choices, too. Not all stores accept their benefits, and not all states have given families the flexibility to purchase alternatives if their normal brand is out of stock. Families in rural areas, who may have only one or two stores in their area that sell baby formula, may also be looking at long drives to find more if those stores run out. The federal government has been working to alleviate the shortage. The US Food and Drug Administration eased rules allowing foreign manufacturers to sell their infant formula in the United States. In July, the agency said it was creating a framework to keep the door to foreign formula brands open permanently.  The Biden administration has sped the delivery of some of those cans through its Operation Fly Formula. As of July 24, the White House says, 17 Operation Fly Formula missions had delivered enough powdered formula to make more than 61 million 8-ounce bottles. “There’s a backlog that’s having to be filled out, but we are seeing measurable improvement,” Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Saturday on NPR’s All Things Considered. “There’s more formula on the shelves, and the production now is exceeding the demand by a significant amount every week. So we’re on the road to recovery, but I don’t want anyone to think we are sitting back at this point.”  He said that when consumers see empty spots on store shelves, it doesn’t mean that type of formula is entirely out of stock, but certain sizes of it might be. When formula manufacturers need to step up production, they cut back on the number of products they make to speed the process. “Whereas they may have, let’s say, been making a 1-pound, 5-pound and a 10-pound pack, they may reduce to just one type so that they can be as efficient as possible in turning out the formula,” Califf said. The key now is to stay the course, he said. “What we need is just to continue for the next six to eight weeks for the production to far outstrip the amount that people need for their babies, and then we’ll be back in good shape with regard to the volume of formula,” he said. Still, the country is not quite out of the woods. How much longer?  Abbott said in a statement to CNN on Monday that it will be shipping Elecare formula made at its Michigan plant “imminently,” and it’s working to restart Similac production “as soon as we can.” Late last week, the US Department of Agriculture told states it would continue to cover the cost of non-contract infant formula to give families that receive WIC benefits – like the Hankinses – flexibility to purchase alternate sizes, forms or brands of formula. The benefit will continue through the end of September.  Geraldine Henchy, director of nutrition policy for the nonprofit Food Research & Action Center in Washington, said that although the extension is good news, “It does indicate that they believe that action is still necessary.” About half of the baby formula bought in the US is purchased through the WIC program, and those families continue to be disproportionately affected by the shortage. “The infant formula system crashed, but for WIC, it really crashed,” Henchy said. The USDA has new powers through the Access to Baby Formula Act, which was signed into law in May.  The agency recently announced that it would require state WIC programs to develop disaster plans in case of future baby formula supply disruptions.  The government is also making funding available to state WIC programs to speed the development of online ordering programs, since WIC families currently can’t use their benefits for online purchases.  Vicki Hankins says she feels like the hardest days of the shortage are behind her. She has begun to see her son’s old brand, Alimentum, in stores closer to home, which has really helped ease her anxiety.

The job cuts come after Walmart last week cut its profit outlook for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, warning that high food and fuel costs have impacted how customers spend.

127,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/investing/amtd-digital-stock-reddit-wallstreetbets-intl-hnk/,"The Reddit retail army is back.  A little-known Hong Kong-based company appears to have become the latest obsession of traders on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, helping its stock shoot up 21,000% since its IPO less than a month ago.  Shares of AMTD Digital have spiked nearly 3,000% over the past week, and were up 126% on Tuesday alone. The company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on July 15, listing its shares at $7.80 apiece. Since then, the price has jumped to $1,679.  AMTD Digital is a financial services startup that trades on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol “HKD.” The company is an arm of AMTD Idea Group, an investment bank based in Hong Kong that is also listed in New York and Singapore. The unit was founded in 2019, and provides fintech services in Asia, including a virtual bank called Airstar. AMTD Digital brought in just over $25 million in revenue last year, according to a regulatory filing. And yet this week its market cap is more than $310 billion, surpassing that of Shell\n            \n                (RDSA) and Costco\n            \n                (COST) and putting it closer to the size of Walmart\n            \n                (WMT) and Exxon\n            \n                (XOM). Even the company was scratching its head over the sudden surge. “To our knowledge, there are no material circumstances, events nor other matters relating to our company’s business and operating activities since the IPO date,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. Its parent company has also benefited from the mania. AMTD Idea Group was the No. 1 trade on Fidelity’s platform on Tuesday, and its stock jumped nearly 237% in New York. The frenzy is reminiscent of the January 2021 run-up in shares of GameStop\n            \n                (GME) and AMC\n            \n                (AMC), which both saw historic upticks after retail investors on the subreddit WallStreetBets seized on what they saw as the companies’ undervalued stocks.  One user on the forum pointed to the similarities Wednesday, asking whether this was “another GameStop AMC situation.”  “Where did AMTD Digital come from,” they wrote. “What did I miss?” There appeared to be no specific reason for the rally, other than online users in recent days calling for people to pile into the shares.  It worked: on Tuesday, the company was one of the most traded stocks on Fidelity, according to the investment firm.

423,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/business-food/national-mustard-day-doughnuts-frenchs-trnd/,"Mustard is on the menu for breakfast this Saturday.  Condiment brand French’s has launched a limited-edition donut covered in – you guessed it – mustard-flavored icing to celebrate National Mustard Day.  The Frankenfood creations were born from an unexpected partnership between French’s and New York City bakery Dough Doughnuts, according to a news release shared with CNN.  “This year, we’re excited to collaborate with Dough and introduce French’s Mustard Donuts, adding our Classic Yellow Mustard to morning routines,” Jill Pratt, chief marketing officer at French’s parent company McCormick, said in the release.   “We are as committed as ever to showing off new and exciting ways to enjoy this fan favorite condiment and cannot wait to reinvent breakfast this year,” she said.  Open-minded gourmands can try out the tangy donuts for free at any of Dough’s six NYC locations on Saturday “while supplies last.”  And mustard fans who can’t make it to New York can order a free box of two donuts for delivery from Dough’s website on Saturday at noon.  Home cooks can also find out if mustard complements donuts as much as it does hot dogs with French’s make-at-home mustard donut recipe.  French’s is no stranger to culinary innovation that blurs the sacred boundaries between sweet and savory. Earlier this year, the brand debuted ketchup-flavored popsicles in Canada.   And in 2019, they released limited-edition, mustard-flavored ice cream for National Mustard Day.

307,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/mark-robinson-trump-motorcade-january-6-cnntv/,"A retired Washington, DC, police officer who was part of Donald Trump’s motorcade on January 6, 2021, told CNN’s Don Lemon on Monday night that the then-President was adamant about going to the US Capitol as the riot unfolded.  The comments by Mark Robinson, who has testified to the January 6 committee, further corroborate key details first revealed by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who spoke at length about Trump’s behavior to the House select committee. Hutchinson said that she was told that Trump became “irate” when informed by security that he would not be going to the Capitol on January 6, because the situation was not secure. Robinson was not physically with Trump on January 6. He was in the lead car of the motorcade and said that he learned Trump wanted to go to the Capitol through communications from the Secret Service.  “We’ve heard it several times while it was on the motorcade. I think during the speech, shortly thereafter, he had finished the speech, that the President was getting into the motorcade and he was upset. And he adamantly wanted to go to the Capitol,” Robinson told Lemon. “And even when we departed from the Ellipse it was repeated again. … It was a heated argument in the limo. And he wanted to definitely go to the Capitol.” In his first interview since testifying, Robinson said he wasn’t aware of the magnitude of the riot when Trump demanded to go to the Capitol. Speaking in hindsight, Robinson said, “Now knowing what actually happened, that would’ve been horrible. Had the motorcade responded to the Capitol, I think, would’ve just been far worse.” “I think it would have probably encouraged more rioting. And (the rioters would have) felt supported. If the presidential motorcade came in support of them. So I think the insurrectionists probably would have felt as though they had the support of the President,” Robinson said. When questioned as to the former President’s possible motives for wanting to return to the Capitol on January 6, Robinson said, “I can’t imagine anyone, especially in that position, wanting to go to the Capitol. You talk about the president. I just can’t imagine someone wanting to go to the Capitol under those conditions.” Robinson said he is “so thankful” that the motorcade did not turn around. “Had we made that move, I thought it would have been an insane movement and I think the sentiment was felt even with the Secret Service.” ",Donald Trump;Cassidy Hutchinson;Mark Robinson,White House;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_POLICE_OFFICER,85;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,85;TAX_FNCACT_AIDE,393;MOVEMENT_GENERAL,2345;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,317;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,484;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,844;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,2407;PROTEST,237;PROTEST,1368;LEADER,1003;LEADER,1869;LEADER,1931;LEADER,2118;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1003;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1869;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1931;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2118;TREASON,1796;SECURITY_SERVICES,77;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,77;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,77;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,85;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,388;VIOLENT_UNREST,1667;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,914;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1568;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1620;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1775;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2355;",White House;Washington,509
198,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/weather/hurricane-season-forecast-update-august-2022/,"This Atlantic hurricane season is still expected to be above-normal, forecasts released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Colorado State University show. Though this season has been less active until now compared to the last two seasons, NOAA and Colorado State expect it to become the seventh consecutive above-normal hurricane season. “Although it has been a relatively slow start to hurricane season, with no major storms developing in the Atlantic, this is not unusual and we therefore cannot afford to let our guard down,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said. “This is especially important as we enter peak hurricane season – the next Ida or Sandy could still be lying in wait.” NOAA’s latest projections call for a 60% chance of an above-normal season. Its forecast calls for 14 to 20 named storms (winds of 39 mph or greater), a slight decrease from the seasonal outlook forecast of 14 to 21 released in May. The forecast includes the three named storms that have already formed this season: Alex, Bonnie and Colin.  Of predicted named storms, forecasters believe six to 10 will be hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher) and three to five will be major hurricanes (winds of 111 mph or higher). NOAA’s previous outlook showed a 65% chance of an above-normal season, with six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes. “While we are now two months into the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, about 90% of all hurricanes and 95% of major hurricanes in the Atlantic occur after the 1st of August, on average,” said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist at Colorado State. An average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. The season runs from June 1 to November 30. Colorado State’s Tropical Meteorology Project team update calls for 18 named storms this hurricane season – one lower than it forecast in April but four more than the annual average.  Of the 18 total predicted storms – which also include the three names already used this season – eight are expected to become hurricanes, and four are expected to become major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. “One reason for (the) reduction in Atlantic seasonal hurricane forecast from CSU is due to development of below-normal sea surface temperatures in subtropical Atlantic,” Klotzbach said. “When the subtropical Atlantic is cooler than normal, it can sometimes favor increased shear in the tropical Atlantic.” The probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the US coastline is now 68%, well above the average of 52% for the past century, according to the Colorado State report. “You can get very active years with this kind of lull period,” said Matthew Rosencrans of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “2021 did have a low period in July, and then after August 11, then we had about 2.4 storms, on average, form every single week.” Why the forecast numbers change These forecasts take into account a lot, such as sea-surface temperatures, La Niña and Saharan dust, and some factors can change quickly. “One reason for reduction in Atlantic seasonal #hurricane forecast from CSU is due to development of below-normal sea surface temperatures in subtropical Atlantic,” Klotzbach tweeted. “When the subtropical Atlantic is cooler than normal, it can sometimes favor increased shear in the tropical Atlantic.” The world is in a La Niña pattern – a main reason forecasters initially went with above-average hurricane activity estimates early in the season. La Niña pattern  is a natural ocean-atmospheric phenomenon marked by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean near the equator that consequently impact weather across the world. While La Niña is certainly a big seasonal driver of how the tropical weather should play out, other phenomena that drive shorter-term variability are also key to updated forecasts. “The Madden-Julian oscillation can either increase or decrease Atlantic hurricane activity,” Klotzbach has said. “The MJO is deep thunderstorm activity that propagates around the globe every about 30 to 60 days. As it does so, it can alter levels of vertical wind shear and mid-level moisture.” Saharan dust and dry air have also been key contributors over the last month. The MJO has prohibited thunderstorm development over Africa – important because thunderstorms that form in western Africa tend to flow west into the Atlantic, becoming the building blocks of tropical weather development. Forecasters are confident changes will soon foster an uptick in tropical systems. “The models are generally forecasting a more conducive pattern for the Atlantic by the time that we get to the middle of August,” Klotzbach reported. “Air is forecast to more consistently rise over Africa and sink over the tropical Pacific. This pattern should result in reduced vertical wind shear.” This means environmental conditions will become ideal just in time for peak hurricane season. Gulf and East coasts face higher risks With only three named storms so far this year, the season is off to a slower start compared to last year, which had five named storms by this date. However, it is important to point out that even the 2021 season experienced a monthlong summer lull until Tropical Storm Fred formed on August 11.  Hurricanes are becoming more dangerous. Here’s why >>> Climatologically, about 30% of all Atlantic hurricanes make US landfall. But that statistic doesn’t always adequately reflect an eventful season. “It’s important to understand that it doesn’t matter if there’s 20 storms or one; if it impacts you, it’s a busy season,” CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. For the Gulf Coast, the probability of a major hurricane landfall for the remainder of this season is 43%, exceeding the full-season average of 30% for the last century, according to Colorado State research.  For the East Coast, from Maine to Florida, the probability is also 43%, which is above its annual average of 31% for the last 100 years.  Statistics like those demonstrate why it is important to start preparing now by reviewing evacuation plans and ensuring evacuation kits are in order.",Phil Klotzbach,Colorado State University;Atmospheric Administration;National Oceanic;Cnn,"CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,777;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,879;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,777;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,879;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,28;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,375;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1268;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1484;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1677;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,2001;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,2280;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,28;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,375;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1268;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1484;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1677;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2001;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2280;SCIENCE,1433;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,1433;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2060;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,997;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1056;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1178;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1204;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1304;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1329;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1526;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1549;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1871;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANES,1917;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,997;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1056;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1178;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1204;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1304;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1329;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1526;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1549;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1871;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1917;EDUCATION,182;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,182;",Colorado;Colorado State University,1263
351,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/kamala-harris-abortion-rights/,"Vice President Kamala Harris has seized onto abortion rights as an issue all her own, cementing herself as the administration’s lead messenger on an area it hopes will resonate with voters at the ballot box in November – and beyond. Harris has spent the last several weeks traveling the country to meet with activists and state lawmakers about abortion rights in deep red and swing states and following the Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion. Even though a White House official said abortion rights are not a part of her official portfolio, the issue has given Harris some momentum after a first year in which the vice president found herself fighting off negative headlines, internal frustration and tough assignments that became political anchors. With the midterm elections less than 100 days away, Indiana state Sen. Jean Breaux, a Democrat, told CNN Sunday she could see abortion rights as a chance for Harris to show off her leadership – both now and in the future. “I thought that there was something behind it for her, as well. That she was trying to position herself as a leader on this issue so that she could show America that she has the potential to lead and can articulate an issue that is resonating with voters all across the country,” she said after attending a roundtable event with the vice president last week. Breaux told CNN that still, she believed Harris is “sincerely concerned about abortion and the loss of abortion rights for women across this country” and White House officials and others downplay the idea Harris is making a political play by focusing on abortion. They argue she is only responding to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established abortion as a constitutional right.  “This is not about the next election. This is about an assault on women’s reproductive rights. This is about an extreme Republican Party that is willing to dismantle freedoms and erode rights. I don’t think anybody’s thinking of it in a political sense,” said Cedric Richmond, who left his position at the White House to be a senior advisor for the Democratic National Committee. While there is no action President Joe Biden can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, Democrats and advocates have been pressuring the White House to do more on abortion rights. The White House has dismissed several progressive ideas to protect abortion access, including allowing abortion providers to work from federal property in states where the procedure is banned.  Abortion rights have long been a prominent issue for Harris in her campaigns. When she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, she vowed, if elected, to require states with a history of restricting abortion rights to obtain federal approval before any new abortion law could take effect. “We cannot tolerate a perspective that is about going backward and not understanding women have agency,” Harris said at the time.  She’s bringing that same intensity to her discussions with state lawmakers about how to respond to the Dobbs decision, in which the conservatives on the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Aides say the vice president plans to be more visible on any topic that is front and center for the Democratic Party as November grows near. In particular, Harris will continue to elevate abortion rights, ramping up her travel to speak to the “urgency of the moment,” three months ahead of the midterms, aides say.  “As a former local official, the vice president is keenly aware of the critical role these leaders play, especially now when it comes to protecting access to reproductive care,” Kirsten Allen, Harris’ press secretary, told CNN. “The vice president will continue to travel the country and meet with leaders and people on the ground to highlight what’s at stake and build coalitions to protect a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from government interference.” Harris finds her voice on the road The vice president has been traveling from state-to-state this summer, sometimes making several trips per week since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade at the end of June. Harris has focused on deeply red and purple states like Florida, Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania where state lawmakers have already put in place, or are discussing, newrestrictive measure to curtail or simply eliminate women’s access to an abortion. Harris will increase that already-ramped-up political travel over the next few months, with a significant number of trips focused on raising money for the DNC and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, according to a DNC official. “She has been intentional about going to places and calling out mainly Republican governors in a way that we really haven’t done up until now,” one aide said.  Harris allies, who had previously criticized the administration’s use of the vice president, now herald President Joe Biden for positioning her in an effective way on an issue where she has “deep credibility.”  “This is just an area where she has a more defined profile,” the White House official said, who noted her focused intensified after Harris gave a forceful pro-abortion speech at Emily’s List hours after the draft opinion leaked. “It was a confluence of events, ability and opportunity all in one.”  The official said Harris then tasked her office with providing her data about wider implications of the Supreme Court’s decision, such as the effects if could have in vitro fertilization (IVF), access to birth control and same-sex marriage. Still, these latest appearances are giving hope to supporters who may have questioned what happened to the fierce former prosecutor who made headlines grilling Republicans during high-profile Senate hearings. “If you think about her as a rising star in the party, that’s what people saw,” one person allied with Harris told CNN. “They’re like, ‘Yes, she’s a fighter for us.’ And so, her voice out there on this issue is helping both to literally fight the fight, but then also to mobilize voters and remind voters what she is uniquely adept at.” Less than 100 days The roundtables with state legislators have been a winning model for the vice president, allies say, as it props up Harris’ ability to convene and organize, while also shining a light on restrictive policy proposals across the country.  They’ve also provided Harris with an avenue to show the skills honed over years as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, providing a more emphatic voice on abortion rights than the President, who has a complicated history on the issue. “I think on issues like this, it’s clear why they are a good pair,” one source close to Harris told CNN. “In this moment in crisis her unique history, credibility, and expertise is just invaluable both to the administration as well as the country,” said Karen Finney, vice chair of NARAL and Democratic strategist The vice president has tasked staff, aides say, with putting more of a focus on engaging younger voters as November grow closer. And a source with a Democratic-aligned super PAC told CNN that their focus groups show that Harris is still a popular figure with Black voters, despite the general dip in approval rating for the President. “So that’s going to be an important angle down the road,” the source said, suggesting Harris be deployed to help Democrats in tight House races, such as Georgia’s Sanford Bishop or Ohio’s Amelia Sykes, who is vying for an open seat. The vice president will start campaigning with a relatively new team around her, after a series of staffers departed her office. A source familiar with office relations says that quicker decision-making has streamlined coordination with the West Wing and the vice president’s office during the administration’s second year. One White House official credited Anita Dunn, who returned to the White House amid staffing changes in the West Wing, as responsible for some of the positive change. That’s led to Harris becoming more of a public face than she was during her first year, doing more media interviews in 2022 than in 2021 and taken far more trips to tout the Biden agenda. Abortion roundtables Harris has held more than two dozen roundtables on abortion rights since a draft opinion previewing the overturning of Roe v. Wade was published in Politico in May.  Florida Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who has attended two roundtables with Harris in both Washington and Orlando and rode on Air Force 2, said, “I really have the genuine sense that she is wanting to hear what we are experiencing on the ground.”  In some ways, Harris has been trying to create a national message for Democrats – repeating at nearly every roundtable how “one does not have to abandon your faith or your beliefs to agree that the government should not be making this decision” for women. But advocates say Harris could be doing more, as they pressure the White House to be more aggressive on abortion rights legislation and meet the moment.  “I’m really glad that the vice president is doing these things,” Renee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, told CNN at in an interview. “But we were asking for very specific things, and we need to see those delivered.” “It would be amazing to see her have a more forceful voice, to be able to say the word abortion unapologetically,” Sherman said, “to have her remind everyone in this country that everyone loves someone who’s had an abortion, and also to see the actions from the White House that match her energy.” CNN’s Maegan Vazquez, Isaac Dovere, Kevin Liptak and Betsy Klein contributed to this

590,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/salem-witch-trials-exonerated-elizabeth-johnson-cec/,"It’s never too late to right a historical wrong – even if that restoration of justice comes nearly 330 years later.  Elizabeth Johnson Jr., a woman convicted of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials in the 1690s, was finally exonerated last week after years of petitioning by Massachusetts teacher Carrie LaPierre and her eighth-grade civics students. Justice came in the form of a brief addition to the 2023 state budget.  Johnson was accused of witchcraft in 1692 along with more than 200 other women and men in Salem. Of those convicted, 19 were hanged and four others died in prison – Johnson was set to be executed, too, but was later spared. And yet, during Johnson’s lifetime and over the centuries that followed, her name was never actually cleared. It wasn’t until Carrie LaPierre, an eighth-grade civics teacher at North Andover Middle School, came across her story and involved her students in her case that Massachusetts legislators took notice.  How to exonerate a convicted witch, 300-plus years later North Andover, a town in northeastern Massachusetts, is only about 40 minutes from Salem. But until she’d read a book on local witches by historian Richard Hite, LaPierre said she had no idea how the Salem witch trials reverberated in the North Andover area – and it was within those pages that she learned of Johnson.  While many other convicted witches were exonerated, many of them posthumously, the late Johnson – or “EJJ,” as LaPierre and her students called her – had “somehow been overlooked while all other convicted witches had been exonerated over the years,” LaPierre told CNN in an email.  Details of Johnson’s life are slim, but her family was a major target of the Salem witch trials, driven by hysteria, Puritanical rule and feuding between families. She was one of 28 family members accused of witchcraft in 1692, according to the Boston Globe.   Johnson made a compelling confession during a court examination: She said that another woman, Martha Carrier, “perswaded her to be a witch” and that Carrier told her she “Should be Saved if she would be a witch,” according to a 1692 document digitized by the University of Virginia’s Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive. Some of the details of her story were sordid and mortifying to Salem’s residents: Johnson said the devil appeared to her “like two black Catts,” and she named several other people in Salem whom she said were involved in witchcraft. She also showed her knuckles, where it appeared fellow “witches” had “suckt her,” according to the 1692 examination document. For her “crimes,” Johnson was sentenced to death at age 22, as the Boston Globe reported last year, but she was given a reprieve by the governor at the time (whose wife had also been accused of witchcraft). In 1711, after state officials realized they’d had little evidence to convict and execute or imprison women (and some men) for witchcraft, they exonerated many of those who’d been convicted or even hanged, including John Proctor, later one of the protagonists in Arthur Miller’s play “The Crucible.”  Johnson’s name, though, was omitted from this list. So in 1712, she petitioned Salem to be included in the act, which provided restitution to families of the accused.  In the letter, she asked “That the Honourable Court would please to allow me Something in consideration of my charges by reason of my Long Imprisonment, which will be thankfully acknowledged as a great favour.”  Why, exactly, Johnson was left out is unclear. But LaPierre decided, after connecting with the North Andover Historical Society, LaPierre that taking up the case of a long-dead “witch” and clearing her name could be an engaging project for her students – a real-life application of civics in action. Johnson is the last Salem witch to be exonerated So LaPierre’s eighth-graders set out on exonerating EJJ, petitioning the Massachusetts legislature with the hopes that a lawmaker would introduce a bill to clear her name. Eventually, after three years and “numerous disappointments,” one state senator heard them – Diana DiZoglio sponsored an amendment to the state budget this year to add Johnson’s name to an existing resolution that exonerated other “witches” by name.   All that petitioning and bureaucratic navigating was instructive for her eighth-grade classes, but LaPierre said “the long-lasting lessons are probably more important: Standing up for justice, advocating for those who cannot do so for themselves, recognizing that their voices have power in the community and the world, and understanding that persistence is necessary to achieve their goals.” The amendment adds Johnson’s name to a 1957 resolution that exonerated several people convicted of witchcraft – and so, finally, Johnson’s wish for absolution was granted.  But the work for LaPierre continues: She’ll have to find a new project for her incoming eighth-graders now that Johnson’s case is closed. She’s leaving it up to her students this year to determine the issues they care about and the courses of action they’ll take to address them.  Whatever her students choose to tackle this year, witches are likely off the table: Johnson is the final woman convicted in the Salem trials to be exonerated. And with that, LaPierre and her class ended a chapter in history that began centuries ago.

146,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/business/walmart-best-buy-gap-promotions/,"A glimmer of relief is emerging at the checkout aisle: the return of discounts. Walmart\n            \n                (WMT), Best Buy\n            \n                (BBY), Gap\n            \n                (GPS), Target\n            \n                (TGT), Bath & Body Works and others are increasing promotions and lowering prices on merchandise to entice inflation-weary shoppers to buy extra goods sitting on their shelves. Months ago these chains stocked up on merchandise, preparing for supply chain shortages and what they projected to be robust consumer demand. But since they ordered, their plans have been derailed by the highest inflation in more than 40 years and slumping consumer confidence.   Rising inflation has forced many consumers to pull back — particularly low-and-middle income shoppers, several retailers say. Cash-strapped shoppers are struggling to afford groceries and gas and have curtailed their discretionary spending.  This has left retailers with too much of the wrong stuff: Think back to the early days of the pandemic, when everyone was redoing their homes and buying new laptops. Stores are overloaded with that stuff now, and they need to discount those items to juice demand. “These retailers have mispositioned their inventory,” said Brian Nagel, a retail analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. “In certain areas, they’re too heavy on inventory and need to clear it out.” Where to find discounts So shoppers can expect to find more deals on discretionary goods such as clothing, electronics, furniture, home goods and bath items — the stuff that has been highly sought after since the start of the pandemic and many people may have already bought.  Walmart: “The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend,” impacting their ability to buy general merchandise, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said last week. Walmart said it would take more markdowns than it previously expected to throughout the inventory, particularly for clothing. The company also introduced a new program for customers to buy refurbished items from brands like Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) and Samsung for cheap. Best Buy: On Wednesday, Best Buy said inflation was impacting consumer-electronics spending, and the electronics industry would be promoting more stuff. “As high inflation has continued and consumer sentiment has deteriorated, customer demand within the consumer electronics industry has softened even further,” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said. Gap: Earlier this month, Gap said it has been increasing promotions to move out inventory during its second quarter, while Bath & Body Works said that it did the same as it saw store traffic slowing down. “Customers, particularly lower-income customers, have become more cost conscious and are limiting purchases and/or seeking out lower-priced sale merchandise,” the company said. “They are being impacted by the overall inflationary environment.”  Target: Last month, Target said it was carrying too many big, bulky products such as furniture, televisions and kitchen appliances during its previous quarter as consumers moved away from those products. “We didn’t anticipate the magnitude of that shift,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said. Target marked down some of those bigger items to make room for products in higher demand. Discount stores: Shoppers may also be able to find more bargains at closeout retailers such as TJX\n            \n                (TJX) and Burlington\n            \n                (BURL), which capitalize on inventory gluts. These chains buy up high-end goods for cheap, then turn around and sell them to shoppers at a discount from their original price. “The buying environment now is better than it has been for years,” Burlington CEO Michael O’Sullivan said last month. “We’re seeing brands that we haven’t seen for a couple of years.”",Doug Mcmillon;Brian Nagel;Michael Osullivan;Corie Barry;Brian Cornell,Samsung;Walmart;Walmart;Walmart;Walmart;Best Buy;Best Buy;Best Buy;Best Buy;Bath Body Works;Bath Body Works;Oppenheimer Co,"TRAFFIC,2705;SHORTAGE,410;TAX_ECON_PRICE,225;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,1341;FOOD_SECURITY,920;UNGP_AFFORDABLE_NUTRITIOUS_FOOD,920;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;ECON_INFLATION,541;ECON_INFLATION,749;ECON_INFLATION,1776;ECON_INFLATION,2218;ECON_INFLATION,2341;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,541;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,749;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1776;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2218;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2341;WB_442_INFLATION,541;WB_442_INFLATION,749;WB_442_INFLATION,1776;WB_442_INFLATION,2218;WB_442_INFLATION,2341;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1877;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2493;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,3225;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,3741;USPEC_POLICY1,972;USPEC_POLICY1,2261;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,972;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,2261;RAIL_INCIDENT,516;MANMADE_DISASTER_DERAILED,516;GENERAL_HEALTH,1079;GENERAL_HEALTH,1678;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1079;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1678;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1079;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1678;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1079;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1678;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1079;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1678;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1079;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1678;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1079;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1678;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1079;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1678;AFFECT,1790;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2956;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3668;",Burlington;New York,748
450,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/asia/us-defend-philippines-south-china-sea-blinken-hnk-intl/,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured the Philippines on Saturday that the United States would come to its defense if attacked in the South China Sea, seeking to allay concerns about the extent of the US commitment to a mutual defense treaty. In meetings in Manila dominated by discussion on simmering US-China tensions over the Taiwan visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Blinken said a 70-year-old defense pact with the Philippines was “ironclad.” “An armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels and aircraft will invoke US mutual defense commitments under that treaty,” Blinken told a news conference. “The Philippines is an irreplaceable friend, partner, and ally to the United States.”  Blinken was the most senior US official to meet new President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr., the son of the late strongman who Washington helped to flee into exile in Hawaii during a 1986 “people power” uprising that ended his two-decade rule. In opening remarks to Blinken, Marcos sought to downplay the diplomatic flare-up over Taiwan and said he believed Pelosi’s trip “did not raise the intensity” of a situation that was already volatile. “We have been at that level for a good while, but we have sort of got used to the idea,” Marcos said. The Philippines is a fulcrum of the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China and Marcos faces a tricky challenge in balancing ties between the two major powers. He will also face domestic pressure to stand up to China in the South China Sea, without angering its leadership. US-Philippines ties were shaken by predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s overtures towards China, his famous anti-US rhetoric and threats to downgrade their military ties. On Saturday, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo said President Joe Biden had invited Marcos to Washington, and both sides were working on a suitable date. Marcos has not been to the US in more than a decade, due largely to a contempt of court order for his refusal to cooperate with a Hawaii court, which in 1995 ordered the Marcos family to return $2 billion of missing state wealth to victims of abuses by the state under his father’s rule. Marcos Jnr. and mother, Imelda, also face a $353 million fine. The US embassy in Manila has said heads of state have diplomatic immunity. Manalo said Washington was an important ally, but concerning nearby Taiwan he told Blinken the Philippines “looks at the big powers to help calm the waters.” “We can ill afford any further escalation of tensions,” he said.",Rodrigo Duterte;Ferdinand Marcos Jnr;Marcos Jnr;Marcos Jnr;Antony Blinken;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden;Enrique Manalo,United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,2474;MARITIME_INCIDENT,603;MARITIME_INCIDENT,856;MARITIME_INCIDENT,941;MARITIME,603;MARITIME,856;MARITIME,941;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,603;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,856;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,941;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,270;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,674;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,270;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,674;WB_1024_PUBLIC_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,270;WB_1024_PUBLIC_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,674;WB_1026_TREATIES,270;WB_1026_TREATIES,674;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,270;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,674;WB_137_WATER,2829;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVES,424;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,169;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1788;MILITARY_COOPERATION,2006;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,586;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,21;REBELLION,1194;EXILE,1151;CRISISLEX_C05_NEED_OF_SHELTERS,1140;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,2434;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,2434;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,546;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,893;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,978;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,432;LEADER,1042;LEADER,2095;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1042;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2095;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1042;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2095;AFFECT,2410;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1020;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,12;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2065;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,837;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,922;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,837;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,922;",Hawaii;Philippine;Taiwan;Philippines;Manila;United States;Chinese;Washington;South China Sea;China,511
640,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/sport/raiders-jaguars-hall-of-fame-nfl-preseason-spt-intl/,"After nearly six long months away, the NFL is back.  The 2022 season’s preseason began on Thursday with the typical curtain raiser at the Hall of Fame game, signaling the beginning of another season of drama, excitement and the highest level of skill imaginable.  And it was the perfect start to life in a new home for Josh McDaniels, the Las Vegas Raiders’ new head coach who joined in January after a long, trophy-laden spell with the New England Patriots.  His Raiders thumped the Jacksonville Jaguars 27-11, spoiling first-year Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson’s debut game at the helm.  It was a homecoming win for Jacksonville native McDaniels, who was returning to the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium where he once played for Canton McKinley High School, patrolling the sidelines he watched his father, Thom McDaniels, coach on for nearly two decades. “Very grateful that I had (the chance),” McDaniels said afterwards. “It’s the first time I’ve been in this Hall of Fame Game in 22 years. To have an opportunity to do that with him here and my family and plenty of people that helped me along the way, I think it was a special night for them.  “You never know if you’ll get this opportunity again. I really savored it. It was a good opportunity for all of us, and I think we all enjoyed it.” In a game without most of both teams’ starters – Raiders quarterback Derek Carr and star wide receiver Davante Adams sat out while the Jaguars released a list of 21 players who wouldn’t be playing including second year quarterback, Trevor Lawrence – it was up to the more fringe players to step up.  And like many preseason games without the star players, it wasn’t the most polished affair.  No. 1 overall pick in this year’s draft Travon Walker was called for a roughing-the-passer penalty against Raiders backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham on the very first play from scrimmage. Walker did display why he was picked first though as he picked up a sack later in the game.  There were opportunities for players to flash though, as rookie running-back Zamir White showed, rushing for 52 yards and adding 23 more through the air.  And it was the Raiders’ rushing attack which really tore through the Jaguars defense, finishing the game with 159 yards total rushing and three rushing touchdowns; one each from Stidham, Austin Walter and Ameer Abdullah.  Raiders kicker Daniel Carlson was perfect from the field too, adding two field goals and three extra-points.  Jaguars running-back Nathan Cottrell scored his team’s only touchdown of the evening, catching a pass from Kyle Sloter in the endzone.  After the game, Pederson praised the effort of his team which was missing many of its starters.  “I thought overall the effort was really good,” Pederson said. “We just have to clean up. There were too many little mistakes.” He added: “We made sure everybody played in this game. As we move forward, it will be a little more the starters and guys we think will be on the 53(-player roster) as we go.”",Travon Walker;Josh Mcdaniels;Josh Mcdaniels;Zamir White;Austin Walter;Sam Webb;Tom Benson Hall;Jarrett Stidham;Tashawn Bower;Davante Adams;Doug Pederson;Ameer Abdullah;Daniel Carlson;Derek Carr;Josh Thompson;Nathan Cottrell;Thom Mcdaniels;Trevor Lawrence;Kendal Vickers;Kyle Sloter,Canton Mckinley High School;Cnn,,Las Vegas,658
518,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/albuquerque-4th-victim-was-at-funerals/,"When Muhammad Imtiaz Hussain looked outside his home, he used to see a safe, idyllic neighborhood. Now he’s haunted by the spot where his brother was ambushed and killed.  “I see from the window, this is the place where my brother died,” said Hussain, who lived in the same Albuquerque apartment complex as his brother Muhammad Afzaal Hussain.  “I’m scared to go outside of my apartment,” the grieving brother said. “I’m scared to sit on my balcony.” For Muslims in New Mexico, everyday life is now permeated by fear after four Muslim men — including Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – were gunned down in Albuquerque. Three of the victims – Hussain, 27; Aftab Hussein, 41, and Mohammad Ahmadi, 62 – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” said Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division. The fourth victim – 25-year-old Naeem Hussain – was found dead Friday night by Albuquerque police. He became the third Muslim man killed in the city within two weeks and the fourth since November. Hours before his death, Naeem Hussain – who just became a US citizen – attended a funeral for two of the other shooting victims. The young man expressed concern about the recent shootings, said Tahir Gauba, spokesperson for the Islamic Center of New Mexico. While no suspect information has been released, Albuquerque police say the killings of the four men from South Asia “may be connected.” Hussain said whoever killed his brother didn’t just steal the life of a beloved family member; they also ripped away his family’s sense of freedom. “My kids do not allow me even to step out of my apartment. They say, ‘Dad, it’s scary,’” Hussain said just steps from where his brother was gunned down. “We planted some flowers in our yard, and we haven’t even watered them. They said, ‘No, somebody might be hiding over there.’” Hussain had the grim task of identifying his brother’s remains at the medical examiner’s office. He said his brother’s body was mutilated so badly, it was clear the killing was deliberate.  “More than half of his head is gone. … At the time that I saw the body, he didn’t even have half of the face,” Hussain said.  “This is not a random killing. This is extremely motivated and extreme hatred.” Reward money increases, but so does the anxiety The grief and terror have spread to Muslims across New Mexico, said Ahmad Assed, president of the Islamic Center of New Mexico. “Incredibly terrified. Panicked. Some people want to move from the state until this thing is over. Some people have moved from the state,” Assed said.  “Businesses are closing … early. Students won’t leave their homes,” he said. “It’s affecting people from coming over to the mosque to conduct their services, their prayers.” Police are seeking “a vehicle of interest” that might be connected to the four killings. They tweeted a photo of the car, a dark gray or silver Volkswagen with four doors and tinted windows. Police said it might be a Volkswagen Jetta. Anyone with information about the car or about the killings is asked to call the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or contact Crime Stoppers at 505-843-STOP or CrimeStoppersNM.com.  “All information you provide will be anonymous and confidential,” the city of Albuquerque said. “There is a $20,000 reward from Crime Stoppers and a $10,000 reward from Council on American-Islamic Relations for information that leads to an arrest.” Hussain said his family is fearful of going out with a killer or killers on the loose. But he said he’s speaking out to try to stop the violence. “I am raising voice for my brother because I do not want any other’s brother to become victim of those shooters, any sister to become victim of those shooters, any mom or dad to become victim of shooter,” Hussain said.  He said he hopes “other people do not become victim of those shooters and suffer like I’m suffering.” ‘They are afraid to go to school’ While police have not called the four killings hate crimes, “in my opinion, clearly it is hate-driven,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Monday. “They are obviously targeting Muslim men, and they are happening right here in our own refugee community,” Keller told CNN. “We know that folks in our community, in the Muslim community especially, they are afraid to even leave their house, especially at night. They are afraid to pray. They are afraid to go to school,” the mayor said.  Albuquerque is not just “in a place of grieving right now, but also at a place of outrage,” Keller said. But the community is determined to help.  “We have marshaled every resource to have now police presence at all our mosques during prayer time,” the mayor said. “We are even doing meal deliveries for families that are afraid to leave their house to get food.” Assed, the mosque president, said he’s now among the many Muslims in New Mexico grappling with fear every day. “I get in the car, and I’m watching every which way possible. I’m watching my side mirror. I’m looking in the back. I’m looking out for any sign of anything out of the ordinary,” he said. “At the end of the day, we don’t have an alternative.”  A new US citizen who fled religious persecution is killed in America Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had become a US citizen just last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami. “He was the most generous, kind, giving, patient and down-to-earth person that I could ever meet,” said Shahalami. “He was very hardworking. He shared whatever he made with his family back home.” The young man, who opened his own trucking business this year, had plans to bring his wife over from Pakistan and buy some property in Virginia, Shahalami said. “He had a lot of dreams, and he accomplished some of them,” Shahalami said. “His others were cut short by this heinous act.” The day he was killed, Hussain attended a funeral for two other Muslim men who were recently killed in the city, said Tahir Gauba, director of public affairs with the Islamic Center of New Mexico. Hussain went to a lunch at the mosque after the funerals and approached Gauba to ask if he had more information on the shootings, Gauba told CNN. “He stopped by to say ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ He was worried. I told him to be careful,” Gauba said. “We thought after burial of these two young men (on Friday), we would have closure and move on and let law enforcement investigate,” Gauba said. “Waking up Saturday morning to his death, the whole community just feels helpless. There’s a lot of fear. … It’s driving everybody crazy.” Two other Muslim men killed – Muhammed Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein – were members of the same mosque. Both were from Pakistan and were killed in southeast Albuquerque just days apart, police said. After their killings, police began investigating whether the November 7 slaying of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan, was connected. ‘The fear is so strong’ The Islamic Center of New Mexico is painfully familiar with violence against Muslims in the community.  An arsonist started a fire on the center’s property in November, the city of Albuquerque’s website said. A month later, police arrested someone on suspicion of arson and negligent arson. Fortunately, no one was in the mosque at the time of the fire, Assed said. But now the center, where about 700 to 800 Muslims gather on Fridays, is warning residents to be cautious. “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” the center posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” After Hussain’s killing Friday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced she will send additional state police to Albuquerque. The city is also increasing police presence at mosques, Muslim-affiliated schools and the University of New Mexico, officials announced. “We have heard from the community that the fear is so strong, there is a concern about even things like groceries and getting meals for certain folks in certain areas of town,” Keller said in a weekend briefing, adding the city is helping with providing meals for those affected by the killings. Albuquerque has always felt like a welcoming community for Muslims, even after 9/11, Gauba said. “This is the first time we are feeling this kind of atmosphere,” he said. “We are in fear.” CNN’s Raja Razek contributed to this report.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Since ancient times, the idea of eternal life has captivated the human imagination. Around the world, there are so-called blue zones where people live exceptionally long and healthy lives. Scientists study these “lands of immortals” to uncover the secrets of longevity.  We may not yet have discovered the healing waters of the fountain of youth, but one of the breakthroughs in this week’s newsletter is shaking up what we know about life and death.  Trailblazers Cutting-edge research on pigs is showing that death in cells isn’t instantaneous.  In fact, it’s a complex biological process – a bit like a cascade of dominoes – that can potentially be halted. Scientists from Yale University have reanimated the cells and organs of pigs that had been dead for an hour using a treatment involving synthetic blood.  The results amazed the researchers involved in the project. Check out the pig cells, shown at right in the side-by-side comparison above, revived by the OrganEx system, a new technology they developed. The goal, though, isn’t to bring animals magically back to life – it’s to expand the window for much-needed human organ transplants.   Force of nature The massive eruption of an undersea volcano near Tonga in January has defied easy explanation, consistently surprising the scientists who continue to study it.  It created an unexpected type of tsunami, a sonic boom heard as far away as Alaska, hurricane-strength winds in space and unusual pressure waves.  Now we know, thanks to detections from a NASA satellite, the volcano blasted such a massive amount of water vapor high into the atmosphere that it’s likely to temporarily warm Earth’s surface. The plume of vapor the eruption sent into the stratosphere – which is located between 8 and 33 miles (12 and 53 kilometers) above Earth’s surface – included enough water to fill 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.  Fantastic creatures  The NASA Artemis mission isn’t just about returning to the moon – it’s part of preparations for a bolder plan to go to Mars.  How astronauts will make the years-long trip to the red planet is uncertain. One idea is to induce hibernation in the space travelers, and a tiny, mouselike creature that lives in the Patagonian forest may hold a key to unlocking this approach.  Once the weather turns cold, the bug-eyed monito del monte builds a mossy nest in a tree hollow. There, the tiny marsupial enters a physiological state called torpor, and its heart rate drops from 200 beats per minute down to two or three beats per minute. During this inactive period, the animal conserves energy, taking a breath once every three minutes. Understanding how it almost stops its metabolism and wakes up weeks later unscathed potentially could help scientists come up with a plan for human hibernation on long-haul space missions. Learn more about the monito during Sunday’s episode of the CNN docuseries “Patagonia: Life on the Edge of the World” at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

Images and data from the agency’s OSIRIS-REx mission revealed the asteroid’s exterior is made of loosely packed particles that aren’t bound together securely. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which in 2020 successfully collected a sample from the asteroid, encountered little resistance when it landed – about the same amount as someone might feel pushing the plunger on a French press coffee maker. If the spacecraft hadn’t fired its thruster to back away after its quick collection of dust and rocks, it might have sunk right into the asteroid. It’s just the latest unexpected finding about Bennu as OSIRIS-REx and the precious sample make their way toward Earth. Ocean secrets  Coins and priceless jewels once belonging to seafaring knights are among the treasures recently discovered on a Spanish shipwreck. The Nuestra Señora de las Maravillas (or Our Lady of Wonders) sank in 1656 after it collided with another boat from its fleet and crashed into a coral reef off the Bahamas. The 891-ton vessel was carrying a massive trove, some of which was reserved as royal tax for King Philip IV, from Cuba to Seville, Spain.  The cache was more significant than usual, as the Maravillas also had been transporting treasure retrieved from a ship that had sunk two years prior.

442,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/senate-democrats-climate-health-care-bill-vote/,"The Senate on Sunday afternoon passed Democrats’ $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill, in a significant victory for President Joe Biden and his party.  The final, party-line vote was 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The package is the product of painstaking negotiations, and its final passage would give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.  The Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, must approve the bill before Biden can sign it into law.  The sweeping bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect. It would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit. Senate Democrats, with a narrow 50-seat majority, stayed unified to pass the legislation, using a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the measure without Republican votes. Final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a “vote-a-rama” that stretched nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told CNN that the legislation he helped write is “a good balanced bill.”  “I think we’ll all benefit from it; the country will,” Manchin told CNN. “We have energy security, that’s what we were looking for. And we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future.” Biden praised the Senate for passing the bill in a statement Sunday, thanking Democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation’s climate investments and health care provisions.  “Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” Biden said.  How Senate Democrats passed the bill on a party-line vote  Senate Democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus. Manchin played a key role in shaping the legislation – which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a major breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals, indicating she would “move forward” on the sweeping economic package.  But Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill.  To avoid a last-minute collapse of the bill on Sunday, Democrats created a plan to win over Sinema, who was concerned over the 15% corporate minimum tax’s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity. Senate Democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal, but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota suggested, they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years.  The change was intended to prevent House Democrats primarily from coastal districts, who have campaigned on repealing limits on the SALT deduction, from breaking from the bill, when they vote on it later this week.  After the bill’s passage in the Senate, Sinema said in a statement it would “help Arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices, making health care more affordable and accessible, and securing Arizona’s water and energy future,” while also “boosting innovation and spurring job creation.” In a good sign for the bill becoming law, key House Democrats signaled later Sunday that they’ll vote for it despite previous demands over SALT. Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey had been part of the “No SALT, no deal” caucus. But he said the bill passes his test because it doesn’t raise individual income tax rates. Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, another member of that caucus, echoed his sentiment: “I will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing SALT. Because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.” Republicans used the weekend “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate’s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included “giant job-killing tax hikes” and amounted to “a war on American fossil fuel.” The Kentucky Republican said Democrats “do not care about middle-class families’ priorities.”  “And their response to the runaway inflation they’ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,” said McConnell. “The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.” How the bill addresses the climate crisis While economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet. Analysis from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to President Joe Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030. The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what’s needed to combat the climate crisis. “This isn’t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.” Key health care and tax policy in the bill The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. This controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear. However, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%. The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.

685,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/business/money/opening-a-new-credit-card/,"With so many options to consider, choosing a new credit card can be daunting. But for most Americans, it’s a necessary step to establishing credit.  About 92 million Americans have little to no credit history, according to Equifax. With scant information to go on, it’s harder for credit bureaus to assess the likelihood that a person will be able to pay back a loan or line of credit.  One way to build your credit history is by opening and using a credit card.  So how do you decide which card is right for you?  Here are the most important factors to consider when shopping for a new card: Is your credit score high enough? Most cards have credit score requirements, among other criteria, so it’s important to figure out what your score is and whether it’s good enough for you to be approved.  But what exactly constitutes a good credit score?  Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com, explains that an excellent credit score is “generally defined [as] 740 or higher on the FICO scale, which goes from 300 to 850.” The FICO score represents how likely you are to pay back your credit card bill based off previous payments. Although many credit cards have a FICO score cutoff of 670, it’s not a strict limit.  “The average FICO score is 716, so most people are in the right ballpark for most cards,” said Rossman. If you want to raise your credit score, Rossman said the key is paying your credit card bills on time, keeping your balance low and proving that you can successfully manage various types of credit over the long haul. And that can take time.  “Much of this is a marathon, not a sprint,” he noted. For those who are trying to improve a lower credit score or who are seeking to build credit, Rossman suggests secured cards, which are backed by a security deposit and are often held in a linked bank account. This functions as collateral should you fail to pay your monthly bill.  These cards also have strict limits and do not allow cardholders to spend more money than they deposited upfront. So if your security deposit was $500, your spending limit will be $500. What rewards does it offer? There are three main types of credit card rewards – cash back, points and miles.  Cash back rewards pay cardholders a percentage of what they have spent on purchases. The cash accumulated can typically be redeemed in the form of a check or direct deposit, applied to future balances as a statement credit, or sometimes used to make purchases.  Points and miles rewards cards give cardholders the option to redeem their rewards for travel, and other products and services.  Whichever form of rewards you choose, you’ll want to make sure it enables you to get the most out of your purchases.  Start by considering how you spend your money. While some cards offer more rewards for spending categories like travel and dining, others offer better benefits for grocery store purchases and gas. Others will rotate the categories that offer the highest rewards, or even let you choose.    Many people prefer cash back rewards because they are easier to navigate and do not require tracking purchase categories, according to Rossman. He suggests finding a card that gives 2% cash back on every purchase. If you’re willing to dabble with different cards in order to chase more rewards, Rossman recommends having a cash back card for general purchases, and then layering in other cards for more specific categories.  “Use something like [a general cash back card] as a floor, guaranteeing you’ll never get less than 2% cash back on a given purchase, and lean into categories in which you spend a lot of money,” said Rossman. Be mindful of fees While many banks won’t charge you anything just to have a credit card, some rewards cards will charge annual fees, typically ranging from $95 per year to as much as $695. “For the most part, the better the rewards, the more annual fees,” said David Lord, general manager at Credit.com.  While some of those fees might seem high, they can be worth it if you know you will use all the benefits the card offers.  “These are often travel cards with premium perks” said Rossman. “The annual fee might be well worth it if you’re going to make good use of the airport lounge, the free checked bags or other perks, but not if you rarely travel.” Another common fee is the foreign transaction fee – which typically adds 3% to the purchase price of products and services bought in other countries. If you travel abroad often, you’ll want to avoid cards that charge such fees.  Most cards will also charge late payment fees. “Up to $30 for the first offense and up to $41 for subsequent offenses within six billing cycles,” said Rossman. Another important fee to consider is a cash advance fee. But Rossman advises against using a credit card to get cash. “There’s a separate fee, plus interest starts accruing immediately at a higher rate than normal purchases.” How high are the interest rates? While credit card interest rates can go as high as 36%, the average credit card charges about 17%, according to Bankrate. These fees can really add up if you don’t pay off your balance every month. For those who carry a balance, the accrued interest can easily cancel out any rewards the card offers.  “It doesn’t make sense to pursue 1%, 2% or even 5% in cash back (or an equivalent amount of airline miles or hotel points) if you’re paying a high interest rate” said Rossman.  But figuring out the interest rate might not be as simple as it sounds. Cards often charge different rates on purchases versus balance transfers or cash advances. And most credit card issuers offer variable rates, which means they can change over time.  Many cards will also offer an introductory rate – some as low as 0% – for a certain period of time. But cardholders need to be aware that the rate can skyrocket when the period ends.  As long as you’re diligent about paying the card off before the introductory period expires, a 0% rate on purchases can prove to be a big financial benefit. That’s especially true for people looking to make a few big purchases – like a vacation or wedding – early in the term but need a little more time to pay it off.  “You can divide what you owe by the number of months remaining and try to stick to it,” said Rossman. “I think this makes more sense than constantly making a series of purchases with the 0% card.” Overall, when picking that new plastic, there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all. Instead, it’s about doing the research and finding what works best for you. “[The] devil is in the details, review the fine print,” said Lord.",David Lord;Ted Rossman,Equifax,"TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,4204;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,897;TAX_FNCACT_GENERAL_MANAGER,4204;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,112;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,185;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1164;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1262;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1994;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2250;ECON_DEBT,1195;ECON_DEBT,1293;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1195;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1293;WB_450_DEBT,1195;WB_450_DEBT,1293;ECON_COST_OF_LIVING,1252;ECON_COST_OF_LIVING,1350;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,6618;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,5205;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,5241;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,5558;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,5605;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,5205;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,5241;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,5558;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,5605;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,5205;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,5241;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,5558;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,5605;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,905;USPEC_POLICY1,2282;USPEC_POLICY1,3114;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,2282;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,3114;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1242;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1340;DELAY,5476;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,550;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,734;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4969;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATE,5758;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATE,5807;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,4493;WB_135_TRANSPORT,4493;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,4493;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,4493;",New York;Americans,1413
147,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/no-knock-raid-breonna-taylor-timeline/,"Four current and former Louisville police officers involved in the deadly raid on Breonna Taylor’s home – including detectives who worked on the search warrant and the ex-officer accused of firing blindly into her home – have been charged with civil rights violations and other counts, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday. The charges mark the first federal counts leveled against any of the officers involved in the botched March 2020 raid. In addition to civil rights offenses, federal authorities charged the four with unlawful conspiracies, unconstitutional use of force and obstruction, Garland said. Former Detective Joshua Jaynes, 40, Detective Kelly Goodlett and Sgt. Kyle Meany, 35, were charged with submitting a false affidavit to search Taylor’s home ahead of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department’s raid, and then working together to create a “false cover story in an attempt to escape responsibility for their roles in preparing the warrant affidavit that contained false information,” according to court documents. Ex-detective Brett Hankison is alleged to have “willfully used unconstitutionally excessive force … when he fired his service weapon into Taylor’s apartment through a covered window and covered glass door.” Hankison, who fired 10 shots into Taylor’s home and was acquitted of state wanton endangerment charges earlier this year, has been indicted on two federal counts of deprivation of rights under color of law. Only Hankison was charged at the state level. The death of 26-year-old Taylor, an emergency room technician, along with that of George Floyd and others, sparked nationwide protests in 2020, leading to changes in policing policy and laws. Here’s a look at the raid, Taylor’s death and its aftermath. The botched raid On March 12, 2020, a Jefferson County Circuit Court judge approved five search warrants for locations linked to Taylor’s ex-boyfriend, a convicted felon suspected of supplying a local drug house. One of those locations was Taylor’s residence. In the early hours of March 13, Hankison and other officers executed a warrant at Taylor’s apartment. Taylor was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker III, when the officers announced their presence and then battered down the front door.  Taylor and Walker yelled to ask who was at the door but got no response, Walker said afterward. Thinking they were intruders, Walker grabbed a gun he legally owned and fired a shot  when the officers broke through the door.  That triggered a volley of fire from the officers. Taylor, who was standing in a hallway with Walker, was shot multiple times. Walker was not injured.  “Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend,” Walker said in a 911 call. Hankison had been standing outside the apartment and is accused of blindly firing through a door and a window. His bullets entered a neighboring apartment, where a pregnant woman, a man and a child were home, according to the state attorney general. Walker was at first charged with attempted murder of a police officer and first-degree assault – Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly was shot in the leg – but prosecutors later decided to drop the charges.  None of the police officers at the raid were wearing body cameras, and there is no video of the night Taylor bled to death in her hallway. Hankison was fired from the police department in late June 2020. The two other officers who fired shots, Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, were not indicted by the state or the federal government. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said they were justified in shooting in self-defense, because Taylor’s boyfriend fired first. No drugs were found in the apartment, and Taylor’s family and their attorney have maintained she was not involved in her ex-boyfriend’s alleged drug deals. The protests Taylor’s death at first went largely unnoticed outside Louisville. CNN covered the story for the first time on May 13, 2020, about two weeks before Floyd died.  By the end of May, Walker’s distressed 911 call from the night Taylor died had been released, and Floyd had died days earlier at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Protests In Louisville turned violent, with gunfire erupting during protests. Seven people were shot downtown overnight May 28. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the shots were fired from within the crowd, not from the police.  In July, protesters marched to Cameron’s front lawn, and 87 people were arrested for criminal trespass, among other charges. In September, protests began to take place nightly in Louisville after a grand jury didn’t charge the other police officers involved in Taylor’s death, indicting only Hankison.  By then, Taylor’s name was known nationally and beyond, just as Floyd’s was, and her death was a central part of the protests that rocked the country throughout much of 2020. Celebrities took up the subject of Taylor’s death, including  NBA star LeBron James and Oprah Winfrey, who put Taylor on the cover of her magazine.  The aftermath Those protests sparked a movement demanding a change in policing and even seeking to defund police departments. Police and some witnesses gave conflicting reports on whether the officers announced themselves before battering down Taylor’s door, but her death drew attention to no-knock search warrants. The officer who rammed the door at Taylor’s apartment testified at Hankison’s state trial that police announced themselves four or five times. In Louisville, the controversy led to the passing of “Breonna’s Law” in June 2020, which bans such warrants and requires officers to wear body cameras when carrying out search warrants. Almost a year later, in April 2021, the Kentucky state legislature passed a bill setting restrictions on no-knock warrants but did not outlaw them outright.  In June 2020, the Louisville police chief was fired after it came to light officers involved in a fatal shooting during a protest were not wearing body cameras.  In September 2020, the city of Louisville agreed to pay a historic $12 million in a settlement with Taylor’s family. It included an agreement for the city to introduce police reforms.  The settlement stipulated the city would establish a housing credit program as an incentive for officers to live in the areas they serve, use social workers to provide support on certain police runs and require commanders to review and approve search warrants before seeking judicial approval, among other changes. “Justice for Breonna means that we will continue to save lives in her honor,” Tamika Palmer, Taylor’s mother, said at the time.  “No amount of money accomplishes that, but the police reform measures that we were able to get passed as a part of this settlement mean so much more to my family, our community, and to Breonna’s legacy.” In late June 2020, more than three months after Taylor’s death, Hankison was fired.  Cosgrove was fired in January 2021 for use of deadly force for firing 16 rounds into Taylor’s home and failing to activate his body camera, according to a copy of his termination letter. Sgt. Mattingly retired in April 2021.

542,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/synthetic-marijuana-study-wellness/,"There’s nothing nice or dreamy about synthetic weed, sold under such catchy names as AK-47, K2, Spice, Scoobie Snacks, Mr. Nice Guy and 24-Karat Dream.   Sometimes packaged as e-juice for vaping or as edibles, most synthetic cannabinoids are sold as dried plant materials sprayed with acetone, embalming fluid or other solvents laced with lab-made psychoactive substances. Between 2010 and 2015, synthetic cannabis poisonings were on the rise, according to the ToxIC Case Registry, with more than 42,000 cases of toxic exposure reported during that time. However, those numbers may now be declining in states in which the use of recreational marijuana is permitted, said Tracy Klein, assistant director for the Center for Cannabis Policy, Research and Outreach at Washington State University in Vancouver, Washington. She’s the lead author of a study that found calls to poison centers about synthetic cannabinoid fell by more than a third between 2016 and 2019 in states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use. “These products are made in a powdered format and could be sprayed on or added to something that looks exactly like natural cannabis. So, in a party situation, I could see that someone could use this unintentionally,” said Klein, who is also an associate professor in the WSU College of Nursing.  However, people may also use synthetic cannabinoids “to attempt to avoid positive drug screens performed as a condition of employment, in substance abuse treatment programs, or in the criminal justice system,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A deadly problem Marijuana copycats have sent thousands of people to emergency rooms over the past decade. Some have even died, including a 17-year-old boy “who suffered a cardiac arrest after reportedly taking a single ‘hit’ of K2/Spice,” according to the CDC. There’s no way to know which synthetic cannabinoids are actually in the purchased product or what else might be in the solvents used to soak the dried plants, experts say.  In April 2018 in Illinois, 153 people fell ill and four died after using synthetic cannabinoids laced with rat poison. Later that year in New Haven, Connecticut, a version of K2 sickened 95 people in two days. They experienced symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, lethargy and a loss of consciousness.  Officially known as “synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists,” these artificial products are different from synthetically made cannabis products that have a medical use, Klein said. “They don’t show up on regular drug tests,” she said, “nor does the body recognize them in any way that has positive effects.”  The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Toxicology, analyzed data from the National Poison Data System between 2016 and 2019. Researchers found there were 7,600 calls related to synthetic cannabinoid use during those three years. About 65% of the calls to poisoning centers were for situations that required medical attention and 61 people died. Over half of those calls (56%) occurred in states with restrictive cannabis policies, the study found. Closer to a third (38.6%) occurred in states that allow medicinal use and 5.5% occurred in “permissive” states, where recreational use is legal, according to the study. How synthetic cannabinoids work Synthetic cannabinoids were first developed in the 1980s as a way to study how tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, impacted the brain to produce a high, the CDC said. “One particular synthetic cannabis was designed by a pharmaceutical company as a potential drug to ease pain,” Klein said. “It was found to be so strong and so powerful, and have so many side effects, that it was not pursued.” Today synthetics are mostly produced overseas and shipped to the United States. In fact, the first shipment “recognized to contain synthetic cannabinoids was seized at a U.S. border in 2008,” according to the CDC. “It’s not just a US problem. This has become an international problem,” said Klein, pointing to data that lists at least 320 different synthetic cannabinoids sold on the illegal market as of February 2022. “And those are just the ones that have been reported and identified,” she added. While not the same as weed, synthetics do work on the same cannabinoid receptors as THC, but can be up to 100 times more potent because of the way they bind with receptors in the brain, Klein said. Exposure can cause mild to severe neurologic reactions, such as agitation and depression of the central nervous system, even to the point of coma. Other symptoms include “sleepiness, irritability, confusion, dizziness, incoordination, inability to concentrate, stroke, and seizures,” the CDC noted. Psychiatric symptoms include “hallucinations, delusions, psychosis, violent behavior, and suicidal thoughts,” the agency said. “Other physical signs and symptoms, including tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension, severe nausea and vomiting, chest pain and heart attack, rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of damaged muscle), kidney failure, and death.” There is no antidote for synthetic cannabinoid poisoning and long-term effects are unknown, the CDC stated.

463,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/michael-langley-marines-black-four-star-general/,"US Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael Langley was promoted to the rank of general in a ceremony Saturday, becoming the first Black four-star general in the military branch’s 246-year history. Langley will take command of the US Africa Command, which oversees the nation’s military presence in Africa, in a change of command ceremony at its Germany headquarters on Monday.  Speaking after the ceremony at Marine Barracks in Washington, DC, Langley said he was “humbled and honored for the opportunity to take on the stewardship of command of AFRICOM” as a four-star general.  “But the milestone and what it means to the Corps is quite essential. Not just because the mark in history, but what it will affect going forward, especially for those younger across society that want to aspire and look at the Marine Corps as an opportunity,” he added.  Langley was nominated by President Joe Biden for the promotion in June. The US Senate confirmed his promotion to four-star general by a voice vote earlier this week.  In remarks during Saturday’s ceremony, Langley paid homage to “those who have gone before,” recognizing Frederick C. Branch, the first commissioned Black Marine, and the Montford Point Marines, the first African Americans to enlist in the Marines who trained at a segregated facility in Montford Point, North Carolina. He also spoke of the importance of diversity in the military to “maintain a decisive advantage over our strategic competitors.” The Marine Corps had refused to recruit African Americans and other minorities until a 1941 executive order signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that “forced the Corps, despite objections from its leadership,” to start recruiting Black Marines the following year. Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Langley graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington and has served with the Marine Corps since 1985. He has commanded at every level and served in multiple continents, being deployed to countries such as Japan and Afghanistan over the course of his career. He most recently served as commander of the US Marine Corps Forces Command and Marine Forces Northern Command and as commanding general of Fleet Marine Force Atlantic.

325,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/health/dream-journal-wisdom-project-wellness/,"Editor’s Note: David G. Allan is the editorial director for CNN Travel, Style, Science and Wellness. This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project, to which you can subscribe here.  It has been my dream for years to host “Saturday Night Live.” Literally. I’ve repeatedly had that dream, going back decades.  I have traveled to space, back in time and turned into a superhero. I’ve been close friends with many celebrities. I’ve created new memories with friends and family, some deceased. I have committed terrible crimes. And I’ve saved the day, repeatedly.  Our sleeping mind is a private theater where you are the director and usually the star, and there is no limit to the production budget. Yes, some of them are boring (the majority of mine are about work), but many are entertaining, incisive and occasionally problem-solving. That’s why you should consider turning a blank notebook into your first dream journal.     There is little scientific research into the benefits of dream journaling, but those who make it a practice find it useful or insightful at best, and interesting at the very least.  Safely insane The first potential benefit of dream journaling is that it may lead to a creative breakthrough. Your subconscious dreaming mind is, by nature, more inventive. Your dreams jump around in time, make leaps in logic, accept contradictions and sometimes make no sense at all to our more conventional conscious mind. “Dreaming permits each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives” is how William Dement, founder of the Sleep Research Center at Stanford University, once put it. There are numerous anecdotes of creative and innovative people who found inspiration in dreams and nightmares. James Cameron famously conjured the vision of a “Terminator” robot crawling after a woman; a dream that sparked a massive film franchise. E.B. White came up with the character of Stuart Little in a dream. As did Mary Shelley of her monster in “Frankenstein.” Computer scientist Larry Page had a dream about downloading the entire internet and cataloging just the links before he did that with the company he helped start, Google.  Paul McCartney got the inspiration to write “Let It Be” after his mother had said that phrase to him in a dream. The melody for “Yesterday” also came to him in a dream. “I’m a great believer in dreams,” McCartney said in a New York Times Magazine interview. “I’m a great rememberer of dreams.” Inception In centuries past, people believed dreams were messages from the dead that contained clues for what the living should do. Egyptian pharaohs believed gods sent messages to us in our dreams; they called them omina, the origin of the word omen. And the major faiths today contain stories in their sacred texts in which dreams are important riddles whose meaning must be worked out. A more current theory about why we dream is that it helps sort, organize and process all the stimuli from our waking life, like clearing out cobwebs. But sometimes there’s silk to be made of the webs, when the answer to a problem you can’t solve in your waking life gets worked out in your more creative dreaming one.  Dream solutions have the advantage of operating “without the limits of time, logic, space or other real-world rules,” Dr. Allan Peterkin wrote in a guided dream journal published by National Geographic. Peterkin is a professor of psychiatry and family medicine at the University of Toronto.  There are historical examples of dream problem-solving, too. Elias Howe designed the modern sewing machine needle from a dream he had about cannibals waving spears at him, according to New England Historical Society. Jack Nicklaus dreamed about a new golf grip that improved his game. Albert Einstein even traced the roots of his theory of relativity to a dream he had as a teen about traveling at the speed of light. Sigmund Freud, who wrote the first scholarly research on interpreting dreams, thought they primarily reveal secrets and embarrassing moments from our past. But his mentee-turned-rival, Carl Jung, thought dreams tap into universal archetypes and contain clues from our subconscious life to help us find happiness and answers to problems. Another theory is that dreams act like a dress rehearsal for real life, a way to safely test out alternatives. That seems a likely explanation of nightmares. Scary dreams originate in your brains’ amygdala, where intense negative emotions such as anger and fear reside, Peterkin explained. They are useful, according to researchers, because they can help train your brain to prepare for challenges and fears in your waking life.  By the way, the word nightmare comes from an image that sounds like a nightmare itself: the Old English word for evil female spirits (maeres) believed to sit on your chest and suffocate you.  ‘The royal road’ Dreams are windows into your deepest self. By gazing into a cracked, fun house mirror of reality, it changes your perspective. And by writing them down and considering what they mean, you travel along “the royal road,” as Freud put it, leading to the knowledge of your mind’s unconscious. “Trying to understand your dreams can become an important part of understanding yourself, your relationships, and your world, both inside and out,” Peterkin wrote. Ellen DeGeneres came out publicly after having a dream about a bird flying out of its cage and setting itself free. Brad Pitt said in a recent GQ interview that by studying his nightmares of being chased, trapped and stabbed he was able to understand and work through “deep scars” from childhood.  “No dream comes just to tell us what we already know. It invites us to go past what we know,” said Jeremy Taylor, author and former president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams.   “I’ve been paying attention to my dreams lately,” wrote director and actor Sarah Polley in her new memoir, “Run Towards the Danger.” “After 20 years in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy I’m used to noticing them. They’re smoke signals from the past, drawing my attention to burned out wreckage in a distant forest of the mind, packed and buried under years of debris, still smoldering. But lately I’ve also started to see dreams as guides, pointing the way forward.”  ‘Poor man’s opera’ One more benefit of recounting and recording your dreams is simply escape. And who doesn’t need a vacation from life from time to time? In your dreams you can visit the past or future, go anywhere in the world or off it, and fly there with or without a plane.  As Kahlil Gibran put it more poetically, “permit us to surrender ourselves to slumber and perhaps the beautiful bride of dreams will carry our souls into a world cleaner than this one.” The word dream comes from the Old English word for “joy, noise or music.” And there is joy in recording the music or deciphering the noise.  “Bed is the poor man’s opera,” an old Italian saying goes. And there is a new performance daily. Dreams can be “an incredible virtual reality model of the world,” Peterkin wrote, “updated with cool new content several times each night.”  In some of my wildest dreams, I married Nicole Kidman, joined Laird Hamilton’s surfing crew, beat LL Cool J in a rap battle and drove Speed Racer’s car, the Mach 5. In still others, Sarah Silverman was my therapist, Ally Sheedy and I had a fling while we made an ’80s movie together, and I played Han Solo in a version of “Hamlet,” using a script made out of graham crackers. I went to high school in the 1800s, with Hulk Hogan, at which time I attended Gen. Robert E. Lee’s funeral. And I was the Batman. I can remember these dreams and hundreds more because I have been writing them down since high school. It’s the simple act of recording dreams that keeps them from evaporating in the sunlight of day. Total recall Of the many dream-themed movies, my two favorites are Christopher Nolan’s “Inception” and the lesser-known 1991 Wim Wenders’ film, “Until the End of the World,” with William Hurt, Sam Neill and Max von Sydow. As a subplot in “Until,” the main characters find a way to video-record their dreams and subsequently become narcissistically addicted to watching them (to the point of madness).  “You’re now looking at the human soul, singing to itself. To its own God!” von Sydow’s character says. As fun as that sounds, present-day technology has not advanced us to the point of DVRing our dreams (yet). The closest thing available is writing them down. There’s little you need to get started. Find a dream journal app or designate a notebook to keep next to your bed. And the next time you recall a dream, even a hazy, half-remembered one, write it down. Even if it’s boring and doesn’t seem worth remembering, write it down. The more you get in the habit of recording them, the better your recall will get.  I also leave a scrap of paper out in case I make some scribbled notes of key words and elements in the middle of the night. Even a single detail can bring back the memory of an entire dream. Telling someone your dream soon after you wake up can also help hold on to it until you write it down. My dream journals have evolved over the years to include headlines for them, tracking themes, people and locations, as well as noting how many were “good” “bad” or “neutral/in between.” I do that to look for trends, but don’t make the bar too high for yourself, especially when you’re starting.  I also, on occasion, will write a note at the end of the dream if I feel I have some insight into its meaning. I may instantly recognize that a dream about being lost in a city is really about losing a work file, for example.  Dream dictionaries compile mythology, psychology and cultural symbolism and can be interesting to look up reoccurring themes in, even if there is little that is scientific about them, except in a Jungian collective, unconscious way.  Just remember always to interpret a dream through your personal experience. For example, a dream dictionary may suggest a dog in a dream means loyalty. But if you’re scared of dogs, it more likely represents something else you’re afraid of. Or if your mom owns five dogs, your dream dog may be standing in for her.  As the great myth expert Joseph Campbell put it, “Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths.”",William Hurt;Paul Mccartney;Elias Howe;Wim Wender;Brad Pitt;Albert Einstein;Ally Sheedy;Jack Nicklaus;Sam Neill;Ellen Degeneres;Laird Hamilton;Hulk Hogan;James Cameron;Mary Shelley;Joseph Campbell;Allan Peterkin;Jeremy Taylor;Sarah Silverman;Larry Page;Carl Jung;Nicole Kidman;Sigmund Freud,National Geographic;Google;University Of Toronto;England Historical Society;Research Center At Stanford University;Cnn;Cnn,"MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,332;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3353;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,40;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,620;EDUCATION,1718;EDUCATION,3538;",Toronto;Egyptian;New York;Italian;Han,2194
186,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/arizona-michigan-missouri-primary-election-takeaways,"Kansas voters handed abortion-rights advocates a massive victory Tuesday, surging to the polls to defeat a measure that would have allowed the GOP-led legislature to impose new restrictions. The vote in Kansas was one of the first tests of the potency of abortion rights at the ballot box since the Supreme Court’s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade and end the federal protection of abortion access.  Catch up on the night’s news here Meanwhile, in Michigan, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump was ousted, while the matchup was set for what will be one of the key gubernatorial races this fall. And in Missouri, the political comeback of a former governor was shut down. In Arizona, local elections officials were still counting votes, but some of the slate of statewide candidates who were endorsed by former President Donald Trump and promoted his lies about election fraud won their Republican primaries, CNN projects. Here are six takeaways from Tuesday night’s primaries: Kansas maintains constitutional right to abortion Kansas voters sent a dramatic message on Tuesday, opting to maintain the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution just weeks after the US Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade. Polls have long shown that voters overwhelmingly support protecting abortions rights. But the win for the “no” vote in Kansas is proof of that and signals that the Supreme Court decision has further angered voters and possibly shifted the politics of the issue ahead of the November elections. The “no” leaves the state constitution unchanged. While lawmakers in the state can still try to pass restrictive abortion laws, courts in Kansas have recognized a right to abortion under the state constitution. The biggest warning to Republicans, many of whom have trumpeted the overturning of Roe and backed pushes to pass stricter abortions laws, is perhaps the turnout in Kansas. With 78% of the vote in on Tuesday night, nearly 700,000 people have cast ballots in the primary, a figure that already dwarfs the turnout in the 2020 presidential primary election. “This is further proof of what poll after poll has told us: Americans support abortion rights,” said Christina Reynolds, a top operative for Emily’s List, an organization that looks to elect women who support abortion rights. “They believe we should be able to make our own health care decisions, and they will vote accordingly, even in the face of misleading campaigns.” A member of the ‘impeachment 10’ is defeated Rep. Peter Meijer became the second of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump to be ousted in a primary Tuesday, losing to Trump-endorsed conservative challenger John Gibbs, CNN projected.  Democrats played a role in boosting Gibbs – a calculated decision that has become a flashpoint, angering some Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans.  Meijer, a freshman, voted to impeach Trump just days after taking office, after the insurrection of January 6, 2021. Gibbs, meanwhile, backed Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.  Meijer’s loss means the Grand Rapids-based 3rd District seat will be one of the most competitive House contests in November’s midterm elections.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, eyeing the seat as a possible pick-up opportunity, spent more than $300,000 on television ads seeking to bolster Gibbs with pro-Trump GOP primary voters by portraying him as a Trump-aligned conservative.  In Washington, two more Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse, were attempting to survive their own primaries. The state’s open, non-partisan primary system in which the top two finishers regardless of party advance to November’s general election made them more difficult targets for Trump and his supporters.  Unknowns in Arizona Arizona’s race for the Republican nomination for governor could depend on whether Trump’s supporters turned out in force on election day in a state that conducts its contests largely by mail.  Karrin Taylor Robson, a former member of the Arizona Board of Regents who is backed by former Vice President Mike Pence and outgoing Gov. Doug Ducey, led former television journalist Kari Lake, a Trump-endorsed election denier, in the early returns Wednesday morning.  But the early results were largely mail-in ballots. Votes cast on election day were expected to favor Lake – a result of Trump’s years-long effort to undermine faith in mail-in voting. The Arizona gubernatorial primary was the most significant contest in a set of primaries that tested Trump’s influence over the GOP.  If Trump’s slate of statewide candidates in Arizona advances to the general election, they’d be positioned to take over the election machinery of one of the nation’s most important presidential battleground states if they win in November. Blake Masters, the venture capitalist endorsed by Trump and backed by millions in spending from GOP megadonor Peter Thiel, won the state’s GOP primary to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, CNN projects.  State Rep. Mark Finchem, a Trump-endorsed “Stop the Steal” activist who has said the state legislature should be able to overturn voters’ will in presidential elections, won the GOP primary for secretary of state, CNN projects. Democrats saw a tight race between Maricopa County recorder Adrian Fontes and state Rep. Reginald Bolding.  And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN projects. There was also one person who had defied Trump and his election lies ousted on Tuesday, according to a CNN projection: Rusty Bowers, the Arizona House speaker. Bowers testified in June about the pressure he faced to overturn the state’s 2020 election results from Trump and others. In return, he was censured by his party, called “unfit to serve” – and now has lost his primary for a state Senate seat. Greitens’ attempted comeback falls flat  Republicans in Missouri breathed a sigh of relief after state Attorney General Eric Schmitt won the wide-open Senate primary, according to a CNN projection.   Perhaps more significant than who won, though, in the deep-red state, is who lost: disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who was attempting a political comeback. Greitens resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusation of campaign misconduct, and subsequently faced abuse allegations from his ex-wife, which he has denied Schmitt, the attorney general, emerged from a crowded field that included two members of Congress, Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long.  Trump stayed out of the race, issuing a tongue-in-cheek statement supporting “Eric” on the eve of the primary – leaving it up to voters’ interpretation whether that meant Schmitt or Greitens.  Dixon victory in Michigan governor’s race sets up referendum on Covid policies  Tudor Dixon, the conservative commentator endorsed by Trump in the final days of the race and backed by large factions of the Michigan Republican establishment, won the state’s GOP primary to take on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN projected.  The clash in Michigan could be one of the nation’s most competitive governor’s races.  Whitmer has cast herself as a bulwark for abortion rights in a state where Republicans have sought to enforce a 1931 law that would impose a near-total ban on abortion.  Dixon, meanwhile, framed the race in her victory speech Tuesday night as a referendum on restrictions Whitmer imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Dixon, a mother of four who is backed by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s family, is also an advocate of school choice — potentially positioning education as a marquee issue in November’s midterm election. Progressives suffer another defeat in Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens’ projected Democratic primary victory in Michigan’s newly drawn 11th Congressional District over fellow Rep. Andy Levin marks another blow against progressives in what has been a mostly disappointing primary season. It’s also a resounding victory for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and its super PAC, United Democracy Project, which has spent millions backing moderate, more staunchly pro-Israel candidates in Democratic primaries. Stevens and Levin are both supportive of Israel, but Levin – who is Jewish – has been more willing to criticize its government’s treatment of Palestinians and is the lead sponsor of the Two-State Solution Act. Progressive Democrats, frequently targeted by AIPAC spending this primary season, have fumed at fellow Democrats for accepting or courting support from the group, which has also contributed to Republican election deniers. AIPAC has defended the practice, arguing that its policy goals need bipartisan support.

123,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/world/coronavirus-newsletter-intl-08-03-22/,"This is the weekly edition of CNN’s coronavirus newsletter. Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven’t subscribed yet, sign up here. If we’ve learned anything over the past two and a half years, it’s that Covid-19 is one strange disease. The latest case in point: the coronavirus rebound.   The condition grabbed international attention last week when US President Joe Biden tested positive for the virus six days after testing negative following his first bout of the illness.   The White House said Biden, who is back in isolation, was experiencing a bit of a “loose cough” but did not have a fever and his lungs were “clear.”   The President tested positive again after being treated with the antiviral Paxlovid. White House officials had previously suggested a rebound case of Covid was unlikely, based on reports of cases around the country, but Biden’s doctors continued to monitor his health and test him. Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid response coordinator, said clinical data shows the rate of rebound infections is low and noted that even those who suffer them are still generally protected from serious illness.  Biden is not the only high-profile patient to develop the condition. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci also experienced rebound Covid-19. Unlike Biden’s, his symptoms got worse when they returned after treatment with Paxlovid, and his doctors prescribed another course of the drug.  Experts have been calling for more systematic research into the instances of rebound to understand who is most at risk and whether the standard five-day course of Paxlovid should be lengthened to prevent it.  Studies have shown that people can pass the infection to others during a rebound, which is another reason to try to understand it better.  The United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health alert to doctors in May about the potential for Covid-19 rebound, saying symptoms sometimes come back, and that may just be how the infection plays out in some people, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated or treated with medications like Paxlovid.  The CDC said most cases of rebound involve mild disease and that Paxlovid “continues to be recommended for early-stage treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 among persons at high risk for progression to severe disease.”  Pfizer, the company that makes Paxlovid, has said its studies showed rebounds were rare, and that they happened in both people who took the drug and those who took a placebo pill. Because investigators noted the phenomenon in both groups, the company doesn’t believe it is tied to the medication. YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED. Q: How does Paxlovid work?  A: Considered a game-changer when it was authorized in December because of its strong performance in lowering the risk of severe Covid-19, Paxlovid – in combination with vaccines and boosters – is thought to be one of the best ways to protect people at high risk for severe illness.  The drug suppresses the coronavirus, blocking an enzyme that helps it reproduce inside the body.  As with all antivirals, the treatment is thought to work best if started within five days of the first symptoms appearing.  Clinical trials of Paxlovid showed that it reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88% when given within five days of the start of symptoms.  Send your questions here.

READS OF THE WEEK  Most US public schools plan to keep masks optional for start of classes  Students are heading to another school year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but this time, there seem to be fewer discussions and less fretting about masks and other mitigation measures – despite a rise in infections across the country.  Most of the largest public school districts in the US are not requiring masks for the new school year, making masking optional as students return to classes and the highly transmissible BA.5 subvariant spreads.   Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Are we making the same mistakes?   The pandemic, which has held the US and almost every other country in its grip, should have taught us valuable lessons about how to manage a public health emergency.  But it seems we are making some of the same mistakes with the monkeypox virus that we made not even three years ago when the SARS-CoV-2 virus started to spread.  Testing for monkeypox, once very limited, is now more available, but underused. The demand for vaccines is outpacing the supply. There are nearly 2 million courses of the highly effective TPOXX antiviral sitting in the Strategic National Stockpile, but many health care providers are still having a hard time getting the medication for their patients.   At this time, only 336,710 doses have been shipped to states. Ordering only just began for about 800,000 more doses. This scarcity has created long lines in monkeypox hotspots like New York City, which has the highest number of cases in the country.   Updated Covid-19 booster shots could be available in September  Moderna and Pfizer booster shots updated to target Omicron coronavirus subvariants could be available in the US in the early fall, pending signoff by federal health agencies, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Friday.  The US Food and Drug Administration advised vaccine makers in June to update the boosters to add an Omicron BA.4/5 component and create a bivalent booster that would work for two different strains.   “Pfizer and Moderna have indicated that they anticipate the modified vaccines being available as early as September,” an FDA spokesperson said.  TOP TIP Many children will soon be returning to schools – while coronavirus cases are still high.  Parents and caregivers have a lot of questions about what precautions they should take. Do kids need to wear masks again? How often should families test kids? What happens if their kids contract Covid-19? How long should they stay out of school?

585,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/tax-credits-energy-savings-climate-bill/,"Democrats’ new party-line tax and clean energy bill is a big deal for climate and energy savings. With nearly $370 billion for energy programs and tax incentives, it represents the largest climate investment in US history.   In addition to the US emissions reductions these will bring, there’s a lot in the bill that could change both how Americans power their homes and what kinds of vehicles they drive.  The bill contains a bevy of tax incentives aimed at pushing consumers, developers, small businesses and others towards clean energy and more efficient energy usage – helping bring down the cost of buying electric vehicles, heat pumps, water heaters, rooftop solar panels and more.   These measures would be more comprehensive than existing weatherization programs, and several would be available to all households, not just low-income ones,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.  Clean electricity nonprofit Rewiring America recently estimated a US household would save $1,800 per year if they installed electric heat pumps to heat their water and heat and cool their air, replaced a gas car with an EV, and installed solar.  The tax credits work in another way to bring down costs: incentivizing cheaper clean electricity powered by renewables.   “There are people who are really on the front lines of the inflation crisis and how expensive fossil fuels are because of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and this bill will be delivering big energy savings for those people,” Leah Stokes, a senior policy advisor at Evergreen and associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told reporters recently.   Here are the main pieces of the bill that help consumers save money.   Savings on buying an electric vehicle: The bill extends the current $7,500 tax credit for a new vehicle, as well as a $4,000 tax credit off a used EV. It also gets rid of the current cap that cuts automakers off tax credits after they’ve sold 200,000 EVs, and it is written so buyers can get an immediate discount at the dealership, instead of waiting weeks or months for their tax credit to come through.  Still, there’s a significant caveat: Automakers and consumers likely won’t be able to take advantage of this tax credit over the next few years. At the insistence of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, the tax credit was written in a way so that automakers are forced to move their EV supply chains away from China and to the US and countries where the US has free trade agreements. Vehicles must be built in North America, and EV batteries must also not come from countries like China.   As a result, US automakers likely won’t be able to offer the credit in the next few years as they try to build up their domestic supply chains, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said.  The tax credit is also limited to trucks, vans and SUVs under $80,000, and other vehicles under $55,000, and has an income threshold for consumers.    Help installing more efficient air conditioning and heating equipment: The bill would provide Americans with tax credits to cover 30% of the costs of installing highly efficient ACs, water heaters, furnaces and other cooling and heating equipment.  Households would be able to receive up to $600 for each piece of equipment, up to $1,200 total per year. There would also be a special credit of up to $2,000 for electric heat pumps. And credits could be used to upgrade breaker boxes, if needed, to handle additional electric load.   This measure replaces a similar tax credit that expired at the end of last year and came with a lifetime cap of $500.   Aid for low- and moderate-income Americans to purchase electric appliances: The legislation calls for providing low- and moderate-income households with rebates of up to $14,000 to buy electric appliances.  The rebates could cover between half and all the typical $14,000 cost of installing an electric heat pump, as well as much of the cost of electric water heaters, stoves and ovens and clothes dryers, as well as upgrading the home’s breaker boxes and electric wiring. The legislation sets aside $4.5 billion over 10 years for this provision.   To alleviate concerns that low-income households would have to pay for the items up front, rebates could be provided at the point of sale or contractors could claim them, for example. It would depend on how state energy offices, which would administer the rebates, would set up their programs.    Rebates for retrofitting homes: Households could receive rebates of up to $4,000 to install energy-saving measures throughout their homes, under the bill. Low- and moderate-income Americans could receive up to $8,000. The rebate amount would depend on the estimated savings that would be achieved. The legislation would provide a total of $4.3 billion in funding over 10 years.   Tax credits to reduce energy leakage: Americans could receive tax credits to cover 30% of the costs of home improvements that reduce energy leakage, such as updated windows, doors, insulation and other weatherization measures, under the bill. They could get a credit of up to $600 per improvement and a total of $1,200 per year. Plus, they could receive a $150 credit to have a home energy audit conducted. The credit would be expanded so families could use it multiple times to make upgrades over time.   Boosting efficiency in HUD housing: The bill would provide $1 billion in grants and loans to affordable housing units administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to increase energy or water efficiency, improve indoor air quality, make clean energy or electrification upgrades or address climate resilience needs. The improvements could include insulation, HVAC upgrades, flood-proofing, storm resistance, water-saving changes and the installation of solar or other renewable energy systems    Tax credits for developers to build energy efficient homes: Builders could receive tax credits of $2,500 for single-family or manufactured homes and $500 for units in multi-family buildings for constructing Energy Star-certified housing. Developers could get $2,500 for each multifamily unit if prevailing wage requirements are met.  The credits would double if the homes or units are also certified under the Department of Energy’s zero-energy ready home program.   A credit of up to $2,000 for building energy efficient homes expired at the end of last year.  Installing solar panels on homes: Tax credits in the bill will cover 30% of the cost of buying a rooftop solar system and home battery storage. The average cost of a rooftop solar system is around $20,000, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. But that upfront cost will result in energy bill savings every year and add value to a home.   For those who live in apartments or can’t install solar on their roofs, there are other ways to get solar energy and lower energy bills, including leasing a rooftop solar system or joining a community solar farm to get power delivered. Tax credits in the bill increase for solar projects in low-income communities as well.    Small business incentives: Small businesses can get tax deductions of up to $1 per square foot of their business to make the space more energy efficient.

Abrams paid tribute to the late “Star Trek” actress Nichelle Nichols, who died Saturday at the age of 89. Nichols had played Enterprise crew member Nyota Uhura on the series and multiple “Trek” films.  “I shall have more to say about the trailblazing, incomparable Nichelle Nichols, who shared the bridge with us as Lt. Uhura of the USS Enterprise,” Takei wrote on social media. “For today, my heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend.” Abrams, who directed the 2009 “Star Trek” reboot and 2013’s “Star Trek Into Darkness,” called Nichols “a remarkable woman in a remarkable role.” “A remarkable woman in a remarkable role. Nichelle, you will be deeply missed. Sending much love and respect,” he wrote on Twitter. “Star Trek” star William Shatner also paid tribute, writing, “She was a beautiful woman and played an admirable character that did so much for redefining social issues both here in the US and throughout the world.” Georgia politician and “Trek” fan Stacey Abrams posted a photograph of herself with Nichols, captioning it, “One of my most treasured photos - Godspeed to Nichelle Nichols, champion, warrior and tremendous actor. Her kindness and bravery lit the path for many. May she forever dwell among the stars.” Actor Colman Domingo wrote, “Nichelle Nichols told us that we belonged in outer space. We are limitless. The heavens have gained an Uhura today.” The official NASA Twitter account posted a tribute saying: “We celebrate the life of Nichelle Nichols, Star Trek actor, trailblazer, and role model, who symbolized to so many what was possible. She partnered with us to recruit some of the first women and minority astronauts, and inspired generations to reach for the stars.” Jason Alexander wrote, “My love for the original Star Trek is profound. Nichelle Nichols was a ground-breaker and a glorious ambassador for her show, her role and science all her life. And a truly lovely person. May she have a wonderful adventure to the final frontier.” ",William Shatner;William Shatner;George Takei;George Takei;Colman Domingo;Colman Domingo;Jason Alexander;Jason Alexander;Ripnichelle Uhurapic;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nyota Uhura;Stacey Abrams;Stacey Abrams;William Shatner Williamshatner,Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,2909;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,3174;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,933;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,975;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1119;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1352;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1554;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,1998;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,2186;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,2360;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,2776;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,3041;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,401;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,401;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,401;KILL,102;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,102;MARITIME_INCIDENT,328;MARITIME_INCIDENT,610;MARITIME,328;MARITIME,610;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,328;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,610;RECRUITMENT,2885;RECRUITMENT,3150;SCIENCE,3460;SCIENCE,3701;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,3426;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,3667;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,74;LEADER,1810;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICIAN,1810;TAX_FNCACT_ROLE_MODEL,2805;TAX_FNCACT_ROLE_MODEL,3070;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2669;TAX_FNCACT_CREW_MEMBER,173;MEDIA_SOCIAL,401;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,401;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,401;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,401;",Georgia,451

394,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/us-counterrorism-afghanistan/,"Shortly before the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Defense Department created a task force responsible for handling counterterrorism strikes inside the country after American troops had left – a so-called “over the horizon” strategy that officials promised would keep Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for terror groups like al Qaeda and ISIS to flourish. More than a year after the creation of that task force, sources say it hasn’t sent a single proposed target to the Pentagon for approval – largely because without a presence on the ground, it hasn’t been able to build enough intelligence on targets to meet the administration’s standards for avoiding civilian casualties. The White House has hailed the CIA operation that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul on Saturday as evidence that using over the horizon counterterrorism capabilities in Afghanistan has been effective. Current and former officials say the successful Zawahiri strike certainly proves that with the right intelligence, the US is perfectly capable of tackling a specific target from afar – but those same sources also said that Zawahiri, a single, high-value target long in the CIA’s crosshairs, was a special case that doesn’t alone prove the effectiveness of the strategy. “There’s a difference between tracking one senior high value target and dealing with the resurgence of these terrorist groups inside Afghanistan,” said Beth Sanner, a former presidential intelligence briefer under President Donald Trump and senior South Asia analyst at the CIA. “It’s a just a whole different ball of wax.” Some intelligence officials have publicly raised concerns that terrorist activity incubated in Afghanistan will spread outside the country’s borders and pose a threat to the United States – and that the US will be blind to it. Asked directly by Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, if he was worried about an attack on the homeland “emanating from places like Afghanistan,” FBI Director Chris Wray on Thursday said, “We are. Especially now that we’re out I’m worried about the potential loss of sources and collection over there.” “I’m worried about the possibility that we will see al Qaeda reconstitute,” he added. Hinting at how high the hurdles have become, some intelligence and military officials who were not involved in the closely-held planning details of the Zawahiri operation were pleasantly surprised that the US was still able to successfully carry out such a precision strike, according to a former intelligence official still in contact with former colleagues.   Administration officials say that on the contrary, the Zawahiri strike is proof that the US is successfully monitoring and countering the threat without American boots on the ground in Afghanistan. Sources familiar with the intelligence behind the strike say the US integrated lots of different nuggets of data from multiple streams of intelligence to locate and target Zawahiri. “I think I’m more satisfied and more confident [in US intelligence in Afghanistan] than I was even a week ago because of what that collection just enabled, which was a pretty remarkable, pretty precise action,” a senior administration official told CNN on Friday. “The fact that there haven’t been other uses of force of that type in the past year means that we are monitoring and we are being judicious – and where we think it reaches the point of needing to act, we’re acting,” the official said. “But I think it is a pretty powerful demonstration of what that capability can provide.” The US now largely relies on drone flights and human networks on the ground to gather information about what is going on inside Afghanistan, according to a former intelligence official and the source familiar with the intelligence.  But drone flights from the Gulf are logistically complicated and have limited loiter time in Afghanistan thanks to the long flight, making them expensive to use and limiting their usefulness. And without a US presence on the ground, intelligence professionals expect human networks may degrade over time.  “I think we don’t know what we don’t know,” one former official said.  Difficult questions For now, there is broad consensus inside the intelligence community that the immediate threat that al Qaeda will be able to use Afghanistan as a safe haven to plan attacks on the US homeland or US interests remains low. But difficult questions remain about whether that risk will grow over time.  Much depends on current unknowns – in particular, how the Taliban responds to the killing of Zawahiri. “Will the Taliban actually let AQ use Afghanistan?” said one source familiar with the intelligence. “There are a ton of factors that play into this debate,” this person said. “And all complicated.” The intelligence community in its annual threat assessment released this year rates the threat from al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen, Somalia and West Africa as a greater risk to US interests abroad than its weakened leadership in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, officials believe, is still gauging its ability to operate under Taliban rule and will likely remain focused on maintaining its safe haven rather than planning external operations – at least for now.   And although al Qaeda leaders have enjoyed “increased freedom of action” under the Taliban, according to a recent UN report, there has been no major influx of new fighters to Afghanistan since the US withdrawal — a reflection of how al Qaeda has evolved away from centrally-planned attacks, according to some analysts.  But as for what happens next, one US source described the analysis across intelligence agencies as “all over the place.” “What we don’t think we have occurring is some sort of regrowth [or] regeneration of an al Qaeda operational presence — even with less famous names [than Zawahiri],” the senior administration official said. There is one school of thought that while some elements of the Taliban may feel honor-bound to uphold its oath to shield old guard members of al Qaeda like Zawahiri, it has no obligation or incentive to make welcome a new generation of fighters. And according to intelligence officials, there are vanishingly few members of the original al Qaeda leadership who remain in Afghanistan, none of whom are likely to replace Zawahiri.  Meanwhile, the recent strike, some analysts argue, may dissuade terrorist leaders from traveling to the country from elsewhere. They argue that the far greater risk is al Qaeda affiliates in Africa and elsewhere that are only loosely connected to core leaders in Afghanistan.  “There’s some people who are very worried,” said Sanner, who is now a contributor at CNN. “I personally think that AQ core in Afghanistan doesn’t do a lot of operational planning.” Others assess that it’s more likely that the Taliban – consumed with trying to legitimize its government amid a financial implosion and an ongoing conflict with ISIS-K – simply may not have the bandwidth to prevent Afghanistan from being used by al Qaeda or its affiliates to plan attacks on the United States. There are also concerns that the remnants of al Qaeda may simply be absorbed into the Taliban.  The UN report found a “close relationship” between al Qaeda and the Taliban.  How the Taliban respond How the Taliban responds to the death of Zawahiri remains an open question – and one that intelligence and military officials are watching closely, multiple officials said.  According to one source familiar with the intelligence, it’s not clear to US intelligence how many people in the Taliban knew that Zawahiri was holed up in Kabul in a house owned by the powerful Haqqani faction – a militant group that is part of the Taliban government. The Taliban has publicly denied that they were aware of his presence prior to the strike and analysts are closely watching to see if his exposure ushers in any kind of rift between the Taliban and the Haqqani.  “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has no information about Ayman al-Zawahiri’s arrival and stay in Kabul,” a statement by the Taliban said. White House officials said on Monday that senior Haqqani Taliban figures were aware of Zawahiri’s presence in the area and even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday’s successful strike, restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children. “As far as we know, many people in the Taliban didn’t know the Haqqani were sheltering Zawahiri in Kabul. “Does that create a split between the Taliban and the Haqqani?” the source familiar with the intelligence said. The senior administration official said Friday that the Taliban “is scrambling a bit to figure out who knew what and who didn’t – and moreover, to get their story straight on what happened.” Some US military officials are hopeful, meanwhile, that the strike may help push the Taliban towards some sort of limited cooperation with the US to target ISIS-K, a common enemy and separate terrorist group in Afghanistan that the US military is far more concerned about than al Qaeda, according to two sources familiar with the dynamic.  “I think this was a symbolic strike that removed an inspirational leader,” Sanner said. “It completes the task of removing the two people who were at the center of 9/11. But it is the end of an era – it is not about a current threat.”",Ayman Al-Zawahiri;Ayman Al-Zawahiri;Donald Trump;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Al Qaeda;Lindsey Graham;Biden Al Qaeda;Biden Al Qaeda;Beth Sanner;Joe Biden;Joe Biden,White House;White House;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Defense Department;United States;United States;United States,"EDUCATION,6348;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6348;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6348;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,753;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,1218;SOC_USSECURITYAGENCIES,1729;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,5727;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,6843;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,7019;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA_IN_AFGHANISTAN,5336;TAX_FNCACT_GUARD,6458;WB_2492_COUNTER_TERRORISM,167;WB_2492_COUNTER_TERRORISM,897;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,167;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,897;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,167;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,897;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,167;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,897;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,209;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2925;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,7364;TAX_FNCACT_TROOPS,216;TAX_RELIGION_ISLAMIC,8380;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,791;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,3399;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,3490;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,9828;LEADER,1677;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1677;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1677;DRONES,3903;DRONES,4107;TAX_FNCACT_USHERS,8311;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_ISIS,383;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_ISIS,7374;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_ISIS,9578;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,6021;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,6804;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,8260;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2721;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,3349;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,3776;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,4052;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,4456;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,6322;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,9266;TAX_ECON_PRICE,4250;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,6527;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,6527;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,6527;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,6527;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,7315;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,8159;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,7315;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,8159;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,355;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,5617;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,5697;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,355;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,5617;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,5697;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,2180;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3919;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4366;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,3151;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,3792;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4405;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,9764;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,8578;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,8660;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,1718;TERROR,1384;TERROR,1457;TERROR,1571;TERROR,1845;TERROR,6835;TERROR,9618;ARMEDCONFLICT,1384;ARMEDCONFLICT,1457;ARMEDCONFLICT,1571;ARMEDCONFLICT,1845;ARMEDCONFLICT,6835;ARMEDCONFLICT,9618;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,376;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,784;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,2376;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,3380;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,3471;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,4595;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,5182;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,5321;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,5552;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,5632;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,5719;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,5945;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,6228;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,6478;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,6672;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,6938;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,7461;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,7570;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,7671;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,8572;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,8654;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,9702;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2056;KILL,715;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,715;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,715;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,715;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,4844;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,4898;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,5412;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,5786;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,6399;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,7265;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,7610;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,7685;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,7704;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,7730;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,8000;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,8148;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,8172;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,8351;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,8512;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,8751;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,9050;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,9166;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,9295;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_TALIBAN,9510;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,734;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,8698;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,274;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,972;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1800;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2488;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2789;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,5348;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,6611;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,7832;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,7874;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,8708;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,9442;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,9000;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,1935;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,2908;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,4581;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,5121;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,5168;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,9981;",White House;South Carolina;United States;America;Washington;Afghanistan;Kabul;Somalia;Yemen;American,1818
469,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/drought-water-canal-colorado-nebraska-climate/,"Residents on this state line have built their industry, economy and lives around the South Platte River. But as an intense and widespread drought digs into the High Plains, flows have decreased.  Unwilling to leave things to chance, Nebraska has taken action by invoking the fine print of a century-old water compact between the two states — and sparking new tension in the process.   Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts in April signed legislation that, within the terms of the compact, would allow Nebraska to build a canal in Colorado to siphon water off the South Platte River. In response, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis described the plan as a “costly and misguided political stunt.”  But it’s a conflict climatologists say could play out more often as drought expands in the West and Central US, draining water supplies and exacerbating strains between urban growth and agriculture. “We go through droughts every 20 years or so, but nothing of this magnitude,” said Tom Cech, former co-director of the One World One Water Center at Metropolitan State University in Denver. “We are in for a wave of water rights battles through the West. This is the driest it has been in 1,200 years.”  Who has the right? The South Platte River runs from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, through Denver, and courses northeast alongside I-76 toward Nebraska. Along the way, the city gives way to miles of farms and ranches on both sides of the Colorado-Nebraska border.  But much of that land is now brown. Concerns about how much water – or how little – is flowing down the South Platte led Ricketts to announce the $500 million plan to build a canal on Colorado land to funnel water into a Nebraska reservoir system during the non-irrigation months in the fall and winter.   “Without this compact and our ability to enforce our rights, we will see the dramatic impact upon our state,” Ricketts said in an April press conference, pointing to Colorado’s ever-growing population and its estimate of nearly $10 billion for 282 new projects along the South Platte. “Should all the long-term goals be affected, they would reduce the amount of water flows coming to the state of Nebraska by 90%.”  That rationale raised eyebrows in Colorado. “The fact is, many of those projects are not necessarily going to come to fruition,” Kevin Rein, Colorado’s state engineer and director of the Colorado Division of Water Resources, told CNN, noting that the state curtails usage based on water-rights seniority to ensure that Nebraska still gets the water it has the right to.   “In the 99-year history of the compact, we have complied with those provisions of the compact,” Rein said. “They are getting what they agreed to.”  Despite the population growth in Denver, Rein said, the amount of water used has decreased because of conservation efforts. However, the state acknowledges future expansion could impact supplies.  “Development along the South Platte River could begin to diminish flows as they travel down the river toward the lower section of the river and ultimately Nebraska,” Rein said.  At the same time, building a canal would have an impact on Colorado water rights, Rein said. But overall, he believes the compact is good for Colorado.  “It’s really two states getting along,” he explained. “What we have is good for farmers in Colorado and good for farmers in Nebraska in that region that are part of a community and work together. And they’re the ones that could be impacted.”   The South Platte River Compact allows Nebraska 500 cubic feet of water per second — with some conditions — in the fall and winter between October 15 and April 1.  However, during the irrigation season in the spring and summer, from April 1 and October 15, Nebraska’s allotment drops to 120 cubic feet per second.    Critically, though, the compact permits Nebraska to build a canal on Colorado land to divert water from the South Platte “for irrigation of lands in Nebraska” and “grants Nebraska and its citizens the right to acquire by purchase, prescription, or the exercise of eminent domain” any land necessary to build and maintain the canal.  Nebraska’s legislature so far has approved $53.5 million for the Perkins County Canal Project Fund for “design, engineering, permitting and options to purchase land.” The state said it has also hired an independent consulting firm to do a cost and timeline analysis. The study is expected to be presented to Nebraska’s legislature before the end of the year.  Caught in the middle of this political tug-of-war are the farmers, ranchers and their communities built around the South Platte in eastern Colorado and western Nebraska — many of whom were surprised to hear of Nebraska’s plans for the canal.  ‘Nobody wants to lose any of their property’   History can be found all around Julesburg, Colorado. There’s the Pony Express Trail and Fort Sedgwick, which was immortalized in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves.”   For Jay Goddard, a banker and fifth-generation rancher in this corner of Colorado, history literally stretches across his land.  Goddard’s ranch bears a two-and-a-half-mile scar from when Nebraska began — but never finished — digging a Perkins County canal more than a century ago.  “Well, obviously, nobody wants to lose any of their property,” Goddard told CNN while walking along the remainder of the ditch, with the interstate highway and Nebraska visible in the distance. The ground on his ranch is dry and brittle. “There’s usually water standing in some of these lagoons and they’re completely dry right now.”    He’s also concerned about the impacts of the canal on the overall health of the river.  “I hope it doesn’t knock down the flow during the wintertime. We have a lot of hunters that come to this area. We have a lot of good wildlife — whether geese, turkey, deer and ducks — that come through on a migration and so I’m worried that it will dry up the river at the wrong time,” Goddard said.   Not only would that hurt Julesburg’s tourism and economy, but it would also impact its neighbors’ businesses as well. Goddard explained that the border is porous, with many — like him — having operations in both states.  “I want to make sure that my [agriculture] producers and the folks that bank on our [agriculture] lending side are taken care of well on both sides of the line,” Goddard said.  Just on the other side in Nebraska, farmer Darrel Armstrong sees the issue as less about Nebraska versus Colorado and more a battle of “agriculture against urban.”  “We feel that in a lot of the agreements that have been made that [rural areas are] coming up short,” Armstrong said to CNN. “The people who are upholding the agreements had nothing to do with making the agreements.”  According to Cech, the population expansion in the High Plains was enabled by the agriculture industry.    “If you don’t have irrigation in Colorado – in the West – all you’re going to grow is probably prickly pear cactus and sagebrush,” Cech said. “Water is key to that economic growth, not only in Colorado or Western Nebraska, but in California and the West in general.”  As the drought lingers, which Armstrong called, “very devastating,” the tougher the conditions for his business. “We are looking at potentially zero production on our dry land crops without water,” he said.   He agrees with Goddard that the South Platte needs to be protected.  “The South Platte basically is the lifeblood to our surface aquifer and so we need to somehow keep the South Platte running,” Armstrong said. “We’re seeing less and less come down the river from what we had in the past.”  Lawsuits could delay Nebraska from moving forward with its canal project. But for now, on these farms and ranches, there are more questions than answers.  “What can they do for me to make sure that it’s not disrupting my production, but also my other producers in this area?” rancher Goddard wondered.  It’s just beginning of a new era of water wars in an age of unprecedented climate change as rivers dry up and desperation flows. “Human nature is our biggest barrier, I believe, in trying to manage water in the West,” Cech said.

197,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/economy/recession-inflation-fed-dudley/,"The Federal Reserve’s war on inflation will eventually kill the economic recovery from Covid-19, former Fed official Bill Dudley warns. The problem is that the Fed began its quest to tame inflation late, leaving the central bank little choice other than to slam the brakes on the economy by drastically raising interest rates.  “Almost certainly there will be a full-blown recession. If we’re not in one yet, I think we will be in the next 12 months,” Dudley, the former president of the New York Federal Reserve, told CNN in a phone interview. Recession fears mounted after government statistics last week showed the US economy contracted in the spring for the second quarter in a row. Although Dudley concedes the US economy has clearly slowed, he doesn’t believe it has weakened enough to qualify as a recession — at least not yet. He pointed to “too strong” payroll growth and factory activity. “It’s not broad or deep enough,” Dudley said of the slowdown. “What we have seen to date is not sufficient by itself to be a recession.”  The unemployment rate remains at 3.6%, near the lowest levels in the past half-century.  However, if the economy continues to weaken later this year, Dudley said it’s possible the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, will determine that a recession did begin early this year. Soft or hard landing? Federal Reserve officials insist they can still pull off a so-called soft landing — taming inflation without causing a recession.  Despite a series of interest rate hikes, the jobs market continues to grow steadily, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. “We think there’s a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market,” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said during a press conference last week. Yet Powell conceded the task has gotten trickier. “We know that the path has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control,” he said. “And it may narrow further.” Dudley: ‘They’re late’ The Powell-led Fed raised interest rates last week by three-quarters of a percentage point at its second consecutive meeting. Dudley said the challenge for the Fed is due in part to its own poor forecasting: the central bank didn’t begin to raise interest rates until inflation was already very high. “They got going really slowly,” Dudley said. “They’re late and that means they have to do more. And that increases the risk of recession. I think a recession is highly likely, and I’ll be very, very surprised if they avoid a recession.” The good news is that Dudley is betting any looming recession would be “mild” in terms of the depth of the decline because corporate and household balance sheets are in decent shape.  He did caution however that continued high inflation means the Fed may not be able to swiftly come to the rescue with interest rate cuts aimed at curtailing a downturn. “It could last longer because it may be that the Fed can’t ease off the brakes too quickly,” he said.  Is Wall Street misunderstanding the Fed? Others are a bit more optimistic. S&P Global Ratings sees a roughly 45% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. “Whether the US can avoid a recession is a toss-up,” Beth Ann Bovino, S&P’s US chief economist, wrote in a report Wednesday.  US markets have ripped higher since last week’s Fed meeting as investors seized on potential hints from Powell that the central bank may soon be able to slow the pace of its rate hikes.  Stocks have continued to rally despite a flurry of comments this week from current Fed officials signaling the war on inflation is nowhere near over. Dudley warns investors are misinterpreting the signals from the Fed, adding that he was “a little bit puzzled” by the market reaction.  “The Fed is still far away from the amount of slack they need in the labor market and from the 2% inflation target,” he said. Dudley added that another rate hike of three-quarters of a percentage point is still “potentially in play,” depending on how the economy evolves. He expects the Fed will need to raise interest rates to 4% or higher — up from 2.5% today.  All of that runs counter to the enthusiasm on Wall Street.  The S&P 500 finished Wednesday at its highest point in nearly two months, while the Nasdaq has surged to levels unseen since early May. Dudley warned that the uptick in the stock market may be counterproductive because it translates to easier financial conditions. And that’s exactly the opposite of what the Fed wants as it tries to tame inflation.  “Ironically,” Dudley said, “the big rally in financial markets increases pressure on the Fed to do more.”",Bill Dudley;Jerome Powell;Beth Ann Bovino,National Bureau Of Economic Research;Cnn;Cnn;Federal Reserve;Federal Reserve;Federal Reserve;Federal Reserve;Nasdaq,"SEIZE,3472;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,602;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,602;ARMEDCONFLICT,45;ARMEDCONFLICT,3695;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,45;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,3695;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,41;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,526;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,1421;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,1786;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,41;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,526;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,1421;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,1786;ECON_CENTRALBANK,252;ECON_CENTRALBANK,2288;ECON_CENTRALBANK,3525;WB_1235_CENTRAL_BANKS,252;WB_1235_CENTRAL_BANKS,2288;WB_1235_CENTRAL_BANKS,3525;WB_318_FINANCIAL_ARCHITECTURE_AND_BANKING,252;WB_318_FINANCIAL_ARCHITECTURE_AND_BANKING,2288;WB_318_FINANCIAL_ARCHITECTURE_AND_BANKING,3525;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,252;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2288;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,3525;WB_1234_BANKING_INSTITUTIONS,252;WB_1234_BANKING_INSTITUTIONS,2288;WB_1234_BANKING_INSTITUTIONS,3525;USPEC_POLICY1,252;USPEC_POLICY1,2288;USPEC_POLICY1,3525;EPU_POLICY_CENTRAL_BANK,252;EPU_POLICY_CENTRAL_BANK,2288;EPU_POLICY_CENTRAL_BANK,3525;WB_336_NON_BANK_FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS,3998;WB_336_NON_BANK_FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS,4053;WB_612_HOUSING_FINANCE,3998;WB_612_HOUSING_FINANCE,4053;WB_332_CAPITAL_MARKETS,3998;WB_332_CAPITAL_MARKETS,4053;ECON_INFLATION,58;ECON_INFLATION,220;ECON_INFLATION,1511;ECON_INFLATION,1724;ECON_INFLATION,2340;ECON_INFLATION,2894;ECON_INFLATION,3708;ECON_INFLATION,3969;ECON_INFLATION,4733;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,58;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,220;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1511;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1724;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2340;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2894;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,3708;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,3969;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,4733;WB_442_INFLATION,58;WB_442_INFLATION,220;WB_442_INFLATION,1511;WB_442_INFLATION,1724;WB_442_INFLATION,2340;WB_442_INFLATION,2894;WB_442_INFLATION,3708;WB_442_INFLATION,3969;WB_442_INFLATION,4733;EPU_ECONOMY,92;EPU_ECONOMY,1273;FUELPRICES,2614;FUELPRICES,2646;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,2614;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,2646;ECON_HEATINGOIL,2614;ECON_HEATINGOIL,2646;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,437;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2504;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,115;TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMIST,3361;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,1593;WB_470_EDUCATION,1593;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,1593;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,1593;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,3351;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,349;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,2105;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,2324;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,4295;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,349;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,2105;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,2324;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,4295;ECON_STOCKMARKET,3587;TAX_ECON_PRICE,2614;TAX_ECON_PRICE,2646;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1795;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;KILL,79;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,1768;WB_855_LABOR_MARKETS,3946;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,1768;WB_697_SOCIAL_PROTECTION_AND_LABOR,3946;UNEMPLOYMENT,1082;WB_2745_JOB_QUALITY_AND_LABOR_MARKET_PERFORMANCE,1082;WB_2670_JOBS,1082;WB_2689_JOBS_DIAGNOSTICS,1082;WB_2747_UNEMPLOYMENT,1082;UNGP_JOB_OPPORTUNITIES_EMPLOYMENT,1082;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATE,1576;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATE,2973;LEADER,494;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,494;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,494;AFFECT,2541;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1431;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3677;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,137;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1297;",New York,967
97,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/world/nepal-wild-tiger-population-scn-trnd/,"Wild tigers in Nepal have clawed their way back from the brink of extinction. There are now almost three times as many wild tigers in the country as there were in 2009, according to the Nepalese government. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba announced the conservation success Friday morning, according to a news release from the World Wildlife Fund. Nepal’s National Tiger and Prey Survey 2022 found there are now 355 wild tigers in the country, a 190% increase since 2009. The exhaustive survey covered 18,928 square kilometers – more than 12% of the country – and required 16,811 days of field staff time. Ginette Hemley, senior vice president for wildlife conservation at the World Wildlife Fund-US, told CNN the announcement represents a major win for conservationists and tigers alike. “Tigers in Nepal and everywhere else that they live in Asia, about 10 countries, were on a steady decline because of two key reasons,” said Hemley. “The most immediate reason was poaching for the illegal animal trade. The second reason was loss of habitat.” “In 2010, it was clear we were going to lose tigers unless we made a concerted effort to turn things around.” Governments of countries home to tigers then set a goal to double the number of wild tigers by 2022 at the St. Petersburg International summit on tiger conservation. Nepal is the first country to release updated tiger numbers in 2022.  Hemley said Nepal “really does stand out as a leader in conservation, especially for tigers.” “There is support for conservation of tigers at the highest level of government,” she said. “That has translated into really effective habitat conservation, bolstering the protection of tigers in national parks, the wildlife reserves.” According to Hemley, one of Nepal’s major conservation strengths is its focus on wildlife corridors, which are forested pathways to help connect otherwise fragmented pieces of tiger habitat. “Nepal has been a pioneer in reforesting areas to make sure those connections are restored and maintained,” she explained. As they mature and move away from their parents, “tigers need to disperse. That dispersal is only possible if tigers can move around safely.” The other key factor in Nepal’s tiger comeback is community involvement in conservation projects, said Hemley. “Communities are the driving force behind this,” she said. “They are employed to do reforestation, maintain that habit, and are directly involved in conservation.”  The World Wildlife Fund has become involved in ecotourism projects in Nepal, added Hemley. As the tiger population has recovered, protected national parks for tigers have become popular tourist attractions, with the revenue from parks helping to support community needs. This fosters a sense of community investment in conservation projects, Hemley explained. Another key ingredient in recovering tiger populations is finding ways for humans and tigers to safely coexist, said Hemley. “What’s really needed is a holistic approach,” she said. “Monitoring tigers, knowing where they’re living, can help communities stay safer.” Nepal has also found success with practical tools, like predator-proof fencing for livestock and lighting the perimeters of villages at night to ward off tigers.  Deploying compensation programs for farmers whose livestock are killed by tigers also enables better human-tiger coexistence, said Hemley.  Conservationists refer to a concept known as “social carrying capacity” to describe the capacity for a certain community to tolerate a certain number of animals like tigers. “Understanding that dynamic and that social carrying capacity is a new area of focus for us,” said Hemley. “Unless people living with tigers want them there, we’re not gonna have them there,” she said.  Protecting tigers also helps protect other endangered or threatened species. “Effectively, if we’re gonna protect one tiger, we’re gonna protect 10,000 hectares of forest,” said Hemley. Tigers also live in “some of the most carbon-rich forests.” It will “help us mitigate climate change as well if we protect these very rich forests.”  But while Nepal is a tiger success story, Hemley pointed out there are still many countries where tigers are in “crisis.” Tigers have gone extinct in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos since 2000, she said. “We have to look at the elements that have led to success in Nepal and India and try to get them replicated. The most important piece of it is political will and political leadership.” The United States also plays a role in tiger conservation. Hemley pointed to the Big Cat Public Safety Act, a piece of legislation which would set limits on the private ownership of tigers in the US and hopefully help prevent the big cats from entering the illegal animal trade.  There are around 3,900 tigers in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and the species is considered endangered.",Sher Bahadur Deuba;Ginette Henley,World Wildlife Fund;World Wildlife Fund;World Wildlife Fund;Cnn;Cnn;Nepal National Tiger;United States,"WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3423;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,3423;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,3423;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,3423;MOVEMENT_ENVIRONMENTAL,754;MOVEMENT_ENVIRONMENTAL,3558;TOURISM,2804;TAX_FNCACT_TOURIST,2804;TAX_ETHNICITY_LAOS,4417;TAX_FNCACT_PIONEER,2099;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,627;LEADER,222;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,222;TAX_ETHNICITY_NEPALESE,193;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_NEPALESE,193;TAX_FNCACT_FARMERS,3444;LEGISLATION,4747;USPEC_POLICY1,4747;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,4747;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,4718;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,1435;KILL,3471;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,3471;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,627;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,627;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SHER,227;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_CATS,4853;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,204;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1726;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,204;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1726;WB_1777_FORESTS,4084;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4084;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,4585;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,4602;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,4188;WB_588_CONSERVATION_FINANCE,2666;WB_589_ECOTOURISM,2666;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_CAT,4704;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,268;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,653;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1313;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1451;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1681;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1801;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1935;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2420;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2606;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2943;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4673;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1270;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1857;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2765;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,1857;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,2765;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,1857;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,2765;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,1857;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,2765;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,4195;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,4195;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,4195;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,222;ENV_POACHING,968;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,16;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,131;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,426;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,763;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,791;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,1087;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,1183;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,1235;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,1475;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,1691;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,1839;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,2249;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,2309;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,2776;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3065;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3172;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3397;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3481;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3712;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3852;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,3933;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,4106;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,4347;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,4368;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,4805;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGERS,4927;WB_698_TRADE,997;WB_698_TRADE,4892;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,374;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,1300;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,1366;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,1555;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,1639;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,2063;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,2370;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,2713;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,3017;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,4035;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,4268;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,4660;AGRICULTURE,3331;AGRICULTURE,3460;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,3331;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,3460;WB_177_ANIMAL_PRODUCTION,3331;WB_177_ANIMAL_PRODUCTION,3460;WB_1949_CLIMATE_SMART_AGRICULTURE,3331;WB_1949_CLIMATE_SMART_AGRICULTURE,3460;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,3056;TAX_FNCACT_SENIOR_VICE_PRESIDENT,627;",Nepal;Vietnam;India;Petersburg;Laos;United States;Nepalese;Cambodia,1010

Sign up for our newsletter series to ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts. Cheer up couch potatoes! Regular stretching and balance and range of motion exercises are as good as aerobic exercise in slowing the progression of mild cognitive decline, a new study has found. “My worry in the beginning of the study was ‘What if only aerobic makes a difference? Good luck getting the majority of Americans to do aerobic exercise on a regular basis!’ It’s not sustainable,” said study author Laura Baker, a professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, via email.   “But we found that cognitive function did not decline over 12 months for either intervention group – the people who did aerobic exercise or the people who did stretching, balance and range of motion,” Baker said. Rudy Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston, welcomed the findings that a modest amount of exercise – 120 to 150 minutes per week for 12 months – may slow cognitive decline in sedentary older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Tanzi, who was not involved in the study, has examined the role of exercise in mice genetically bred to have Alzheimer’s disease and found exercise induces the birth of new neurons in the section of the brain most affected by Alzheimer’s while also boosting beneficial growth factors that improve neural activity. “So often, the benefits of interventions observed in Alzheimer’s mouse models do not translate to human patients. It is nice to see that in this new study, the benefits of exercise perhaps do translate from mice to human,” said Tanzi, who directs the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. What is mild cognitive decline? The study, presented Tuesday at the 2022 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in San Diego, followed 296 participants who were completely sedentary at the beginning of the experiment. All had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment – the earliest stage of the slow slide into dementia.  “Individuals who have mild cognitive impairment are not cognitively normal, but they don’t have dementia,” Baker said. “They’re fully capable of taking care of themselves, but what they have to go through to do so is exhausting. “‘I can’t remember where I’m supposed to be. Let me check my calendar. Oh, I forgot to write on this calender. Let’s check another calendar. Oh, I can’t find that calendar. I’ve lost my phone. Where is the key? I can’t find the key.’ “They’re able to regroup in the early stages and accomplish things,” Baker said, “but the toll is immense.” Participants in the study underwent cognitive testing and then were randomized into two groups. One group did moderate-intensity aerobic training on treadmills or stationary bikes, striving for a goal of 70% to 85% of heart rate reserve: “That’s about 120 heartbeats per minute for about 30 to 40 minutes for a standard 70-year-old,” Baker said.  The other group did stretching, balance and range of motion exercises designed to allow them to move their body in ways that would help them navigate in real life. “Folks in the balance-range of motion group said they were thrilled – they could go to soccer games with grandchildren without being concerned about tripping, or they could drive and turn their neck to see the back, which they had not been able to do before,” Baker said. Importance of support Both groups exercised twice a week with a personal trainer and then two other times weekly on their own for the first 12 months. Combined, the groups completed more than 31,000 exercise sessions during that time, Baker said.  At the end of the 12 months, cognitive function had not declined in either group. That’s impressive, Baker said, because a control group of equally matched people with mild cognitive impairment – who did not exercise – did decline. Studies have shown that social support is also key to improving brain health. So is it possible the results of the study were due to an increase of social support and not the exercise?  “Well, we don’t know for sure,” Baker said. “But there is enough science showing the benefits of exercise on brain health alone. So this is not something to sweep under the carpet. “And our recommendation would never be for people with mild cognitive impairment to do this alone,” she added. “They are going to need support. So exercise alone is not a prescription. Exercise with support is a prescription, and that is going to be our recommendation.”",Rudy Tanzi,Alzheimer Association International Conference;Harvard Medical School;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EDUCATION,667;EDUCATION,1048;",North Carolina;Boston;San Diego;Wake Forest University;Americans;Massachusetts,947
324,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/democrats-republicans-abortion-elections-kansas/,"It isn’t often that Democrats look to deep-red Kansas for resounding affirmation. But on Tuesday night, when Kansans overwhelmingly voted to keep protections for abortion rights in their state constitution, that is exactly what happened. The size and scope of the result were a shock to even the most optimistic Democrats. Not only did voters reject a proposed constitutional amendment that would have opened the door to strict abortion laws in the Republican state, but they did it by turning out in huge numbers, dwarfing turnout in more recent primary elections and signaling that the issue can motivate even Republican-leaning voters in a state former President Donald Trump won by 15 points in 2020. The political impact of what happened in Kansas will be most directly felt in the November midterm elections – particularly in races for governor and attorney general after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, throwing the issue of abortion to the states. The June ruling has led to bans on the procedure being enforced in several states while opening the door to more restrictions in others. At least four other states will be voting on abortion-related ballot measures this November, but Democratic strategists are looking to the Kansas result to extrapolate lessons for states where abortion won’t be on the ballot. “As the first state to vote on abortion rights following the fall of Roe v. Wade, Kansas is a model for a path to restoring reproductive rights across the country through direct democracy,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “We know that Kansas will not be our last fight, or our last victory.”  Democratic and Republican operatives acknowledged Wednesday that the result in Kansas, while limited to one state, could shift the way each party approaches the midterms. Democrats, buoyed by polling and the Kansas result, will likely attempt to make abortion a top issue in key races, hoping to link their Republican opponents to the support for stricter abortion laws. Republicans, likewise, will continue to be cautious on the issue, largely ignoring their party’s long-held desire to tighten abortion laws across the country and instead hoping to keep the focus on the economy. “I think our Republican candidates are going to keep focusing on the issues most important to voters, and every poll keeps saying that is rising costs and the economy,” said a Republican operative working on House races. A GOP operative working on Senate races added: “The midterms are not going to happen in a vacuum, and there are other issues that voters are considering when they cast their ballot in the fall. It is not going to be an up-or-down vote on one issue.” Democrats were more hopeful that the Kansas result was a positive sign for the party’s midterm prospects, amid low approval ratings for President Joe Biden and rising inflation and other economic concerns. “We already knew that the majority of Americans support abortion rights, but last night’s results in Kansas showed us that it’s also a motivating factor for voters,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Democratic operative and the managing director at progressive consulting firm Bully Pulpit Interactive. “We’ll likely see more Democratic candidates learn from Kansas and lean in on the threat and urgency of abortion bans across the country and start communicating that directly to voters.” The results across the country on Tuesday, however, also highlighted a complicated relationship between voters and abortion. While Kansas voters resoundingly rejected the abortion amendment, Republican primary voters in places such as Arizona, Michigan and Missouri also nominated candidates for governor, US senator and other top positions who support enacting stricter abortion restrictions. Republicans look for footing on abortion issue Since the Supreme Court’s decision in June, many Republicans have been attempting to walk a fine line on abortion. Pennsylvania gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano is one of the clearest examples. While running in the commonwealth’s GOP primary, Mastriano called abortion his “No. 1 issue.” Since winning the nomination, he has been less emphatic, instead arguing that it’s the “people of Pennsylvania” who will decide the future of abortion in the state. In a statement after the June ruling, Mastriano – a state senator who has backed and sponsored strict anti-abortion legislation – said Republicans “must not take our focus away from the key issues facing Pennsylvania families.”  And Mastriano is not alone as Republicans across the country try to keep the focus on sky-high inflation and voters’ sense of economic malaise instead of more controversial issues like abortion. The National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a memo following the May leak of a draft opinion that foretold the Supreme Court’s eventual decision, urging candidates to “be the compassionate, consensus builder on abortion” and to cast themselves as willing to “listen” to people who disagree with them on the issue. A Republican operative working on Senate campaigns said that while the Kansas result “reflects there is a lot more nuance in the politics of abortion than most people realize,” the NRSC has been advising candidates to “make up their minds how much they want to talk about the issue” but to know that “voters want to make it about the issues that are impacting their lives day to day,” like the economy. Some Republicans also believe a focus on abortion would allow Republicans to go on offense against Democrats who oppose limits on the procedure. “You need to press Democrats on no limits,” said Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist who was a top spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee in 2018, noting his party’s attempts to attack Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman for saying “no” when asked if there were “any limits on abortion you would find appropriate?” Polls show Roe decision is broadly unpopular Polls have consistently shown that the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is broadly unpopular and that a majority of Americans support protecting abortion rights. A CNN poll released in late July found that nearly two-thirds of Americans disapproved of the high court’s ruling, including 55% of self-identified moderate or liberal Republicans.  But the vote on Tuesday was the first real world test of that support in an era without the protections of Roe, and the result points to not just the accuracy of recent polls but to how voters – even in a deep-red state like Kansas – are energized over the issue, giving Democrats an opening. “This is further proof of what poll after poll has told us: Americans support abortion rights. They believe we should be able to make our own health care decisions, and they will vote accordingly, even in the face of misleading campaigns,” said Christina Reynolds, a top operative at EMILY’s List, which backs female Democrats who support abortion rights. After the draft Supreme Court opinion was leaked in May, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said a national ban on abortion was “something worthy of a debate,” acknowledging that both state legislatures and Congress would likely take up the issue. Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a former chair of the House Republican Conference, told a reporter last month that Republicans in the chamber wouldn’t put forward a national abortion ban “before the election,” before adding, “Well, yeah” when asked if they would if they won the House in 2022. Abby Curran Horrell, executive director of House Majority PAC, the leading Democratic super PAC focused on House races, framed the issue as one of Americans losing a key right – echoing messaging that worked for Democrats in 2018 around the issue of health care. “Republicans want to take this right away from Americans, and Democrats want to guarantee this freedom and the freedom to control your own body,” she said. “This is taking away a fundamental right that has a major impact on Americans across the country. And Americans don’t like it when rights are taken away.” ",Abby Curran Horrell;John Fetterman;Cathy Mcmorris Rodgers;Donald Trump;Matt Gorman;Joe Biden;Alexis Mcgill Johnson;Christina Reynolds;Doug Mastriano;Xochitl Hinojosa,National Republican Senatorial Committee;Pennsylvania Democratic Senate;Senate Minority Leader Mitch Mcconnell;National Republican Campaign Committee;Cnn;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Supreme Court;Parenthood Action Fund;Us Supreme Court,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,2279;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,3244;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,3672;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,4873;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,5234;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2046;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3787;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3884;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,4431;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,4551;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5436;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5493;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,6302;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,7366;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,7812;TAX_FNCACT_MINORITY_LEADER,7043;ECON_INFLATION,2884;ECON_INFLATION,4613;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2884;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,4613;WB_442_INFLATION,2884;WB_442_INFLATION,4613;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2960;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,6097;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,6201;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,6674;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,7689;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,7856;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,8029;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,8061;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,52;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,748;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1247;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1417;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1612;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1746;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,1874;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,2754;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,3017;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,3262;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,3518;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,5098;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,6537;TAX_ECON_PRICE,2394;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,7180;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,7180;TAX_FNCACT_SENATOR,3698;TAX_FNCACT_SENATOR,4347;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,4406;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,4994;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,5766;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,7043;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,6758;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,7797;LEADER,661;LEADER,1557;LEADER,2855;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,661;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1557;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2855;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,7572;BAN,1001;BAN,3313;TAX_FNCACT_BUILDER,4917;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3144;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,7572;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,714;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,7563;MEDIA_MSM,7338;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,7338;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,852;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,3685;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,3975;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,5805;ELECTION,341;ELECTION,633;ELECTION,2345;ELECTION,2600;ELECTION,3071;ELECTION,3378;ELECTION,3493;ELECTION,3525;ELECTION,3598;ELECTION,5322;ELECTION,6493;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,29;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,320;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1841;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2720;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,5528;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,5594;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,6590;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,6931;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,7760;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,7870;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,29;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,320;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1841;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2720;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5528;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5594;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6590;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6931;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,7760;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,7870;TAX_FNCACT_MANAGING_DIRECTOR,3144;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2253;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,5676;GENERAL_HEALTH,6753;GENERAL_HEALTH,7792;MEDICAL,6753;MEDICAL,7792;LEG_CONSTITUTIONALAMENDMENT,384;USPEC_POLICY1,2242;USPEC_POLICY1,2408;USPEC_POLICY1,5416;EPU_ECONOMY,2242;EPU_ECONOMY,2408;EPU_ECONOMY,5416;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2242;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2408;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,5416;TRIAL,863;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,863;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,458;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1686;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1979;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2268;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2428;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3583;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4725;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5033;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5641;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5704;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,7309;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,1516;TAX_FNCACT_STATE_SENATOR,4347;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2335;LEGISLATION,440;LEGISLATION,2031;LEGISLATION,2173;CONSTITUTIONAL,203;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,282;WB_695_POVERTY,282;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,3286;",Pennsylvania;Kansas;Michigan;Americans;Arizona;Washington;Missouri,1555
279,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/us/uvalde-texas-governor-meets-families/,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott met privately Monday with some families in Uvalde, discussing school safety, a teacher who was also there told CNN. Robb Elementary School teacher Arnulfo Reyes expressed his skepticism of the governor’s visit to the town, where questions and frustrations remain over the official response to the May 24 massacre that left 19 students and two teachers dead. Reyes said he and Abbott spoke in person Monday morning after the governor’s office reached out to him last week.  “I felt like it was just a political thing, I don’t think they cared,” Reyes said, when asked how he felt about the governor reaching out. “I think it was just it’s all for show. … If he would have cared, he wouldn’t have done the NRA (convention) in Houston after our tragedy.” Abbott canceled an in-person appearance at the NRA convention on May 27 but did release a video message that was played in the arena. He instead attended a news conference in Uvalde.  Reyes said he asked the governor why the state’s minimum age to buy a firearm hasn’t been raised from 18 to 21. In Texas, people 18 and older may buy long guns and buyers who are at least 21 can purchase a handgun from a licensed dealer. The gunman in Uvalde bought two semi-automatic rifles around the time of his 18th birthday.  “I asked him about the age limit … why do we still have it at 18? Why couldn’t it be moved to 21?” Reyes said. “He said that they had found it unconstitutional to change the age or something like that.” Abbott’s office, when asked for comment about Reyes’ description of the conversations, said, “Governor Abbott is meeting privately with victims’ families. Out of respect to these families who are still grieving, the discussions will remain private.” Abbott has met with more than two dozen families in Uvalde and will continue talking to families, according to a statement from Abbott spokesperson Ranae Eze.  Reyes told CNN that Abbott met Monday with several families, including the mothers of Tess Mata and Eliahna Garcia, who were both killed at the school. Abbott said he plans to make sure that all schools are safe before the school year begins and claimed Uvalde schools would now be more secure than others, according to Reyes. At a meeting last week, the Uvalde school board announced it plans to improve school security, including hiring additional officers for the district police force, which had five members on the day of the shooting. Parents and other community members voiced their frustration at the meeting about what they called a lack of transparency on the part of the board over what will be done to make their children feel safe going back to school. The school calendar has been pushed back to implement some of the security upgrades, officials have said. Friends of NRA event loses fundraiser site near Uvalde In Hondo, Texas, less than an hour’s drive east of Uvalde, a spirited city council meeting was held Monday during which members voted 4-1 to revoke a rental agreement for a Friends of the NRA fundraiser that was set to be held Saturday at a city-owned facility. The decision was made after several relatives of Robb Elementary shooting victims spoke out during the meeting.  Nikki Cross, a relative of Uziyah Garcia, who was among the students killed, said, “I am not here protesting the NRA or anything like that. I am just here asking your community to take into consideration it’s only been two months for us.” Jazmin Cazares, whose sister Jackie died in the Uvalde shooting, addressed council members, naming each victim of the massacre. “It is a slap in the face to all of Uvalde, especially the ones that lost a loved one, some of us being here today. What’s an even harder slap in the face is the AR-15 you get if you donate $5,000 to the NRA,” she said. The Hondo event information page for reserved table packages says a $5,000 donation gets the buyer a table for eight, some Friends of the NRA merchandise and a choice of a Daniel Defense AR-15-style rifle or a shotgun. “What happened to love thy neighbor? Is that not a thing here? The specific gun that they are giving away in this, what if that falls into the hands of another angry 18-year-old?” Cross said, referring to the Uvalde gunman who used a Daniel Defense firearm. “Then it could be your children that are at risk and we would stand with you. I am just asking that you postpone it. Give us time to grieve. We are going through enough already.”  Friends of the NRA is affiliated with the NRA but is a separate entity. According to its website, it is a fundraising program under the NRA Foundation and promotes shooting sports. Sandy Steubing, a Hondo resident and volunteer with the the event, told the council: “All the Friends of NRA Foundation does is raise funds in furtherance of their charitable and educational mission.”",Arnulfo Reyes;Tess Mata;Eliahna Garcia;Greg Abbott;Ranae Eze,Texas Department Of Public Safety;Texas Department Of Public Safety;Robb Elementary School;Robb Elementary School;Robb Elementary School;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,553;EDUCATION,112;EDUCATION,185;EDUCATION,2217;EDUCATION,2298;EDUCATION,2434;EDUCATION,2547;EDUCATION,2697;EDUCATION,2740;EDUCATION,3089;EDUCATION,3103;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,112;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,185;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2217;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2298;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2434;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2547;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2697;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2740;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3089;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3103;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,112;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,185;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2217;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2298;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2434;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2547;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2697;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2740;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3089;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3103;DELAY,824;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,2053;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,131;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,208;LEADER,263;LEADER,478;LEADER,642;LEADER,1044;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,263;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,478;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,642;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1044;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2749;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3167;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,384;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,2271;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOLS,2350;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,402;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,402;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,402;TAX_WEAPONS_GUNS,1167;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,664;TAX_WEAPONS_FIREARM,1087;TAX_FNCACT_DEALER,1242;KILL,362;TERROR,362;ARMEDCONFLICT,362;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1610;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1741;TRIAL,2519;TRIAL,2632;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2519;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2632;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICERS,2788;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,2788;MEDIA_MSM,1572;MEDIA_MSM,1703;TRANSPARENCY,2990;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCIPAL,2459;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCIPAL,2572;SECURITY_SERVICES,2812;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,2812;CONSTITUTIONAL,1505;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3188;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,3058;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,336;",Robb Elementary School;Houston;Texas Department Of Public Safety;Texas;Uvalde,1036
293,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/election-threats-workers/,"The FBI’s process for receiving reports of violent threats or harassment against election officials is not built to handle the volume of reports, leaving the Justice Department with an incomplete picture of the problem’s scope as the midterms approach, the executive director of a national election officials’ group told Congress on Wednesday. “A common refrain I hear from my members is that nobody is going to take this seriously until something bad happens, and we are all braced for the worst,” Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) said in written testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Some senior election officials have struggled to get security details from state police, Cohen will testify, in an environment that has only grown more tense amid false conspiracy theories about fraud in the 2020 presidential election. More broadly, election officials lack a clear definition of what constitutes a threat or harassment at the federal level, according to Cohen’s written remarks. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, the FBI said it has “Election Crime Coordinators positioned in each of our field offices across the country to engage directly with local and state officials about all election-related crimes, offer guidance, and share information about potential threats.” “The FBI has seen a significant increase in threats of violence against election workers since our last national election, and we have been coordinating closely with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to address threats and intimidation against election officials, volunteers, and staff,” the statement continued. The Justice Department last year set up a task force for investigating threats of violence and intimidation to election workers. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. told the Senate panel that the task force has provided election workers’ organizations with information on how the department decides to open a criminal investigation and has encouraged “broad reporting” of any threats the workers might receive. Polite met virtually with about 750 election officials on Monday to give them an update on the task force, according to the Justice Department. The task force has reviewed over “1,000 contacts reported as hostile or harassing by the election community,” of which about 11% “met the threshold for a federal criminal investigation,” the department said. Polite said Wednesday that the task force has received a single reported incident of physical violence against an election worker. The task force has brought criminal charges against five people, Polite said, and local officials in Colorado, Arizona and Michigan have each pursued a criminal case for threats against election workers. “It is important to bear in mind that the vast majority of communications directed at election workers, offensive though they may be, will not constitute true threats subject to federal criminal prosecution due to the robust protections afforded to political speech by the First Amendment,” Polite’s written testimony said. More than half of the potentially criminal threats were in battleground states where the 2020 results were challenged, such as Arizona, Georgia, Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin, according to the Justice Department. Election officials have more on their plate than ever in trying to tamp down disinformation about the voting process while keeping an eye on foreign hacking threats and threats of violence. A classified briefing that US intelligence and national security officials held for election officials in April covered threats of violence based on conspiracy theories, a change in the threat landscape since 2020, CNN previously reported. A Massachusetts man was arrested Friday after being indicted by a grand jury for allegedly making a bomb threat last year towards an election official in Arizona. As a result of the threats and harassment to election officials, “NASED has heard from state election offices in which every employee now has a concealed carry license and actively carries a weapon,” Cohen’s testimony says. “[W]e have heard from state election offices that have seen long-time employees abruptly give notice en masse with no jobs lined up, citing safety concerns; and we have heard from states that have lost 25 to 30 percent of their local election officials because those public servants no longer want to work in this environment,” Cohen will testify. Tearful testimony as threats are discussed Another witness on Wednesday, Kim Wyman – who leads election initiatives at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity arm – choked up during her testimony, telling lawmakers that a tape that was played detailing some of the threats had made her emotional. “Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy,” said Wyman, a Republican who previously was Washington’s secretary of state.  Wyman testified that she has overseen over 150 elections in her tenure at roles in Washington and CISA, and that she has “witnessed firsthand the challenges” election officials face. Republicans on the committee, however, cast doubt on whether a Justice Department task force on election threats was really necessary, grilling Polite on whether the department’s resources would be better spent focusing on the demonstrators outside Supreme Court justices or threats to anti-abortion pregnancy crisis centers. “The Department of Justice is not choosing what to convene task forces by levels of violence,” said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the committee. “They’re choosing a political message, I believe, and that will have a real consequence on the safety and lives of many Americans.” Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican of Utah, asked Polite what measures the DOJ was taking to prevent its investigations into election worker threats from having “an undue effect on the chilling of First Amendment protected activity.” Polite said that concern – one that requires the careful review of each allegation that is reported – is part of what makes the task force’s work “significant.” Democrats defended the need to focus on threats against election workers. “These threats are taking a disastrous toll on our democracy,” Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat of Illinois, said. Building out resources Federal officials have looked to strengthen physical and cybersecurity support for election administrators. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has 127 physical security specialists across the country who can assess election facilities for safety, and the agency plans to hire 15 more by the end of the year. Yet funding and other resources are a long-term challenge for security of and administration of elections, according to experts. The Justice Department clarified in January that a criminal justice grants program that gives states millions of dollars each year can be used to protect against physical threats against election workers. A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN in June that the department division overseeing the grants had yet to report any use of funds to protect against threats of violence to election workers. CNN has requested an update to that data. Polite said Wednesday that the DOJ office that runs the grant program, the Office of Justice Programs, conducted “several webinars for election stakeholders” on how to access grant funds, which could be used for protective security details and physical security enhancements to workplaces.

254,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/business-food/ben-and-jerry-israel-unilever/,"Ben & Jerry’s independent board said parent company Unilever, with which it is locked in a dispute over the sale of its Israeli business, had frozen its directors’ salaries in July as a pressure tactic ahead of a mediation on the matter.  The Cherry Garcia ice cream maker surpassed $1 billion in sales last year for the first time, becoming one of 13 Unilever brands to achieve such a scale, the board also said. Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever, which has owned the Burlington, Vermont-based company since 2000, on July 5 to try to stop the sale of its business in Israel to local licensee Avi Zinger. Ben & Jerry’s last year said it no longer wanted to sell its products in the occupied West Bank because it was “inconsistent” with its values, which prompted Unilever to make the sale. The deal with Zinger made the ice cream available to all consumers in Israel and the occupied West Bank. “This decision for us to go to court is because of Unilever’s\n            \n                (UL) sale without our input, which is a clear violation of the letter and the spirit of our original acquisition agreement with Unilever,” board chairperson Anuradha Mittal said in an interview with Reuters. “If Unilever is willing to so blatantly violate the agreement that has governed the parties’ conduct for over two decades, then we believe it won’t stop with this issue.” “If left unaddressed, Unilever’s actions will undermine our social mission and essential integrity of the brand, which threatens our reputation and ultimately our business as a whole,” she added. Unilever did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ben & Jerry’s and Unilever last month tried to reach an out-of-court deal on the spat but on Monday notified a federal court they had failed to do so.  A hearing on Ben & Jerry’s request to block the sale is scheduled for Monday, August 8. The battle has tested how far Unilever is willing to go to give its brands freedom to have social missions. Unilever has more than 400 brands, including Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Knorr soup and Vaseline skin lotion.",Avi Zinger;Anuradha Mittal;Ben Jerry;Ben Jerry;Ben Jerry;Ben Jerry;Ben Jerry;Ben Jerry;Ben Jerry,Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Unilever;Reuters,"ARMEDCONFLICT,1926;TRIAL,424;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,156;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRPERSON,1216;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,215;WB_840_JUSTICE,215;WB_938_MEDIATION,215;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,215;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,215;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,130;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,558;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,658;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,716;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1601;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,254;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,932;",Burlington;Israel;Israeli;West Bank,461
400,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/oxford-school-shooter-home-life/,"Michigan prosecutors say the parents of accused Oxford High School shooter Ethan Crumbley exposed him to years of “chaotic, toxic conflict,” and that they left him in an unstable home often with little supervision, creating a pathway to violence.  In a court filing Thursday, prosecutors argued that evidence of Jennifer and James Crumbley’s personal problems, including an extramarital affair and substance abuse, should be allowed to be introduced at their trial. Attorneys for the couple have called the evidence “extraneous.”   The parents were each charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter after their teenage son allegedly shot and killed four students and injured seven other people at Oxford High School in November.   Prosecutors argued that Jennifer and James Crumbley played “a much larger role than just buying their son a gun,” and that there were many things the parents could have done, other than simply locking up the gun, that could have prevented the tragedy. They also argued the parents had “every reason” to know their son was dangerous.   “What the evidence will actually show is that these defendants exposed their son to years of chaotic, toxic conflict, which is a well-known risk factor for entering the pathway to violence,” the filing states. “The investigation paints a clear picture of parents who were not just in constant conflict, or who just exposed their son to conflict, but who actively inserted him into their conflict…”  Investigators have interviewed witnesses from across the country who interacted with the family as far back as when Ethan was in kindergarten, the filing reveals. Neighbors and others told investigators that the parents would consistently fight and drink to excess, often leaving Ethan unsupervised.  Evidence also shows the parents spent thousands of dollars on alcohol and care for horses and negligible amounts on medical care, the filing states. Ethan felt the financial stress and wrote about it in his journal, prosecutors said.  “My grades are falling, my parents hate each other, we have no money, I have zero help for my mental problems and it’s causing me to shoot up the f**king school,” one journal entry states.   Prosecutors also allege that when Ethan was six, his mother took him to stay the night with a person she was having an affair with and left him on the couch. When he was older, prosecutors said, Jennifer and James Crumbley would ask their son to investigate potential infidelities or check up on one of the parents, inserting him into their personal problems.  When Ethan went through stretches of poor sleep or insomnia, he “complained of seeing demons and asked for help” but his parents ignored him, prosecutors said.   “Their son was deteriorating before their eyes; he went through stretches of sleeping only a few hours per night – staying up very late at night while defendants drank, argued and slept only a few feet away in a bedroom that shared a wall with the shooter’s room,” prosecutors said.  Witnesses also told investigators the parents were “routinely intoxicated” in front of Ethan and that marijuana was often used in the house, according to the filing, and that the parents spent nearly $4,000 at a nearby liquor store in 2021 alone.  Prosecutors emphasized in their filing that they are asking to admit the evidence of Ethan’s exposure to infidelity, substance abuse, arguments and financial stress to show the stressful environment created by the Crumbley parents in the days and years before the deadly shooting.  CNN requested comment from attorneys for Jennifer and James Crumbley on the allegations made by prosecutors but did not receive an immediate response.",James Crumbley;James Crumbley;James Crumbley;James Crumbley;Ethan Crumbley,Oxford High School;Oxford High School;Oxford High School;Oxford High School;Cnn;Cnn,"EDUCATION,71;EDUCATION,723;EDUCATION,789;EDUCATION,902;EDUCATION,2390;EDUCATION,2961;EDUCATION,3018;EDUCATION,3075;EDUCATION,3132;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,71;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,723;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,789;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,902;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2390;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2961;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3018;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3075;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3132;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,71;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,723;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,789;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,902;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2390;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2961;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3018;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3075;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3132;GENERAL_HEALTH,2123;MEDICAL,2123;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1551;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1551;WB_840_JUSTICE,1551;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1551;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1551;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1551;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1551;TAX_DISEASE_SUBSTANCE_ABUSE,429;TAX_DISEASE_SUBSTANCE_ABUSE,3812;WB_1406_DISEASES,429;WB_1406_DISEASES,3812;WB_1437_SOCIAL_DETERMINANTS_FOR_HEALTH,429;WB_1437_SOCIAL_DETERMINANTS_FOR_HEALTH,3812;WB_1438_ALCOHOL_AND_SUBSTANCE_ABUSE,429;WB_1438_ALCOHOL_AND_SUBSTANCE_ABUSE,3812;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,429;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3812;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,429;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,3812;CRIME_ILLEGAL_DRUGS,3550;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,676;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,492;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,3996;WOUND,686;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,686;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,686;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,686;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,158;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1440;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1624;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1667;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1717;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,158;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1440;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1624;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1667;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1717;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,94;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,797;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,910;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3038;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3152;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,3415;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,873;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,986;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1241;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSES,2091;KILL,665;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,665;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,71;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,723;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,2961;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,3075;TAX_FNCACT_KING,2383;SOC_GENERALCRIME,580;TAX_WEAPONS_GUN,1102;TAX_WEAPONS_GUN,1201;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2084;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,264;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1512;TRIAL,25;TRIAL,308;TRIAL,1005;TRIAL,2227;TRIAL,2430;TRIAL,2605;TRIAL,2924;TRIAL,3434;TRIAL,3692;TRIAL,4065;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,25;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,308;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,1005;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2227;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2430;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2605;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,2924;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,3434;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,3692;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,4065;",Oxford High School;Michigan,722
122,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/uniting-for-ukraine-phishing-scam-cec/,"A recently reported scam is targeting sponsors who are trying to help Ukrainians come to the United States, according to US immigration officials. US Citizenship and Immigration Services says the agency recently received reports of an email phishing scam targeting would-be participants in Uniting for Ukraine, the Biden administration program that gives people in the United States the opportunity to sponsor Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion. The reports described “a basic email phishing scam that requested payment from prospective Uniting for Ukraine supporters before USCIS would review an application,” the agency said. In reality, the program does not charge a fee for the filing of a declaration of financial support, one of the documents would-be sponsors are required to submit. “USCIS has cautioned applicants and beneficiaries against possible scams related to this key humanitarian parole program,” the agency said. The agency has shared several social media posts recently that warn of reported scams tied to the program and link to a USCIS website offering tips for avoiding and reporting scams. “Beware of fake denial letters with typos and other signs of not being official USCIS correspondence,” the agency said in a June tweet. The agency said the tweets were part of routine efforts to better protect applicants to its programs by highlighting scams, fraud and misconduct on the USCIS website and social media platforms.  Uniting for Ukraine began accepting applications in late April. It’s billed as a fast, streamlined program and “a key step toward fulfilling President Biden’s commitment to welcome Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion.” The program requires Ukrainians seeking entry to the United States to be sponsored by people based in the US. Ukrainian applicants are considered for humanitarian parole on a case-by-case basis for up to two years. If accepted, they are eligible for work authorization. As of last week, USCIS says it has received more than 92,000 requests from people agreeing to support Ukrainian citizens or their immediate family members as part of Uniting for Ukraine.   Through the program, more than 62,000 Ukrainians have been authorized to book their own travel to the US, USCIS says. And 29,000 people have successfully arrived in the US as part of the program, according to the agency. About 71,000 additional Ukrainians have been processed into the US since March 24 through other immigration channels, USCIS says. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in late February, millions of refugees have fled the country. Scams have also been reported in connection with other Ukraine relief efforts, including via accounts on cryptocurrency exchange platforms.",,Immigration Services;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"IMMIGRATION,141;IMMIGRATION,183;IMMIGRATION,1187;IMMIGRATION,1542;IMMIGRATION,3226;WB_2670_JOBS,141;WB_2670_JOBS,183;WB_2670_JOBS,1187;WB_2670_JOBS,1542;WB_2670_JOBS,3226;WB_2769_JOBS_STRATEGIES,141;WB_2769_JOBS_STRATEGIES,183;WB_2769_JOBS_STRATEGIES,1187;WB_2769_JOBS_STRATEGIES,1542;WB_2769_JOBS_STRATEGIES,3226;WB_2837_IMMIGRATION,141;WB_2837_IMMIGRATION,183;WB_2837_IMMIGRATION,1187;WB_2837_IMMIGRATION,1542;WB_2837_IMMIGRATION,3226;WB_2836_MIGRATION_POLICIES_AND_JOBS,141;WB_2836_MIGRATION_POLICIES_AND_JOBS,183;WB_2836_MIGRATION_POLICIES_AND_JOBS,1187;WB_2836_MIGRATION_POLICIES_AND_JOBS,1542;WB_2836_MIGRATION_POLICIES_AND_JOBS,3226;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,141;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,183;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,1187;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,1542;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,3226;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1711;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2163;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1711;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2163;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1711;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2163;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3429;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,3429;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1074;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1429;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2377;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,3264;TAX_FNCACT_CITIZENS,2767;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIAN,2508;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIAN,2758;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIAN,2508;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIAN,2758;AFFECT,982;AFFECT,1337;REFUGEES,982;REFUGEES,1337;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,579;ECON_BITCOIN,3472;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,85;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,426;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,967;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,1128;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,1310;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,1322;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,1483;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,1665;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,2362;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,2420;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,2948;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,3161;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,85;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,426;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,967;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,1128;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,1310;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,1322;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,1483;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,1665;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,2362;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,2420;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,2948;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,3161;LEADER,2323;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2323;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2323;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,446;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,446;CYBER_ATTACK,255;CYBER_ATTACK,503;CYBER_ATTACK,1240;CYBER_ATTACK,1595;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,151;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1207;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1562;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,2648;WB_2372_AUTHENTICATION_AND_AUTHORIZATION,2648;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1711;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2163;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,1711;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2163;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,1711;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2163;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,1711;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2163;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1925;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1021;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1376;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,1021;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,1376;",Russian;Mexico;Ukrainian;Ukrainians;United States;Tijuana;Russia;Ukraine,506
183,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/indiana-abortion-bill-house-vote/,"An Indiana bill that would ban abortion at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions is headed for debate in the state’s full House of Representatives this week after clearing a key committee in the chamber Tuesday evening. The GOP-authored legislation passed the Indiana House Committee of Courts and Criminal Code with an 8-5 vote following hours of testimony from the public. The committee vote nearly fell on party lines, with Republican Rep. Cindy Ziemke siding with four Democrats to oppose the measure.   The version of the legislation that passed in the state Senate over the weekend, Senate Bill 1, provides exceptions only for rape, incest and for when the life of the mother is at risk. Indiana presently allows abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization (or 22 weeks after the mother’s last menstrual period). If the bill receives enough votes Thursday, it will move to a third reading on Friday before a final vote is expected to be taken on the full bill, House Democrats said.    Still, several amendments to the bill were discussed Tuesday, including changes to the language on abortion and abortion clinics, and a push to delay the bill’s effective start date from September 1 to November 1, according to House voting records.    Indiana and West Virginia have recently convened special sessions to consider restrictions on abortion since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending a federal constitutional right to the procedure and sending the matter to the states for consideration. Discussion of the legislation in the state Senate on Saturday was fiery and emotional at times. State senate President Suzanne Crouch, a Republican, threatened to clear the gallery more than once following outbursts from both inside the session and from protesters gathered outside.  CNN affiliate WRTV filmed a large number of protesters chanting opposition to the bill in the hall. Some held signs reading “my body, my choice,” and “abortion bans replace freedom with force.” The bill ultimately cleared the state Senate in a 26-20 vote following nearly four hours of debate. Ten Republicans crossed party lines voting against the bill, with some of them saying the near-total ban did not go far enough. Throughout the legislative cycle, anti-abortion group National Right to Life and its Indiana affiliate have expressed opposition to the bill, calling it “deeply flawed” and a “weak and troubling” measure. “The bill fails substantively in many areas, including its failure to provide any meaningful enforcement provisions. This bill goes through the motions on paper, but lacks any teeth to actually reduce abortions in Indiana by holding those who perform abortions or would intentionally skirt the law accountable with criminal consequences,” Indiana Right to Life said in a statement.

202,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/monkeypox-vaccine-biden-administration/,"The US Department of Health and Human Services waited more than three weeks after the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the US to order bulk stocks of the monkeypox vaccine that the government owns and stores in Denmark be bottled and sent to the US for distribution – in part out of concern that once those vaccines were taken out of bulk storage, they would lose years of shelf life. “We were thoughtful about using the bulk vaccine because once you remove it from bulk, you lose years of shelf life,” an HHS spokesperson told CNN.  That initial delay, first reported by The New York Times, is expected to come under further scrutiny as monkeypox cases climb in the US and some public health experts warn that the country does not have enough vaccines in hand to contain the spread.  When the first confirmed case of monkeypox emerged in the US on May 18, the country had just 2,400 doses of the Jynneos vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile. In subsequent days, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), an office within the HHS, ordered 72,000 of doses of Jynneos vaccines – which were already bottled and ready to be distributed – be sent from Denmark to the US.  But the first time the ASPR ordered government-owned bulk supply of the vaccines be bottled and sent to the US – half a million doses in total – wasn’t until June 10, according to the agency. (By this point, there were fewer than 50 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the US, according to HHS.)  Those doses have yet to arrive in the US, as monkeypox cases continue to climb in the country.  In July alone, the US ordered an additional 5 million doses of the bulk supply of vaccines be bottled and sent to the US, but because of the lengthy bottling process, those also will not start arriving in the US until later this year – with many of the does not scheduled to arrive until even 2023. Of the 6.9 million monkeypox vaccines that the US has secured so far, 1.1 million have been offered to states and local jurisdictions.  HHS’ claim that a part of the reason the government waited several weeks to order large amounts of the frozen Jynneos vaccines be bottled and sent to the US because once they are taken out of storage, they lose years of shelf life, comes amid growing scrutiny of the US’ initial monkeypox vaccine strategy.  CNN reported last week of the growing concern that the US may have lost its chance to contain the monkeypox virus. Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Havey Institute for Global Health at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told CNN that the federal government’s early vaccination strategy was “just doomed to failure.” Meanwhile, the New York Times also reported that HHS seriously “miscalculated the need” for vaccines early on in the outbreak. According to the Times, by the time the government ordered the bulk stocks of the vaccine be bottled for distribution, “the vaccine’s Denmark-based manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, had booked other clients and was unable to do the work for months.”",Robert Murphy,Havey Institute For Global Health;White House;White House;Human Services;Administration For Strategic Preparedness;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Northwestern University Feinberg School Of Medicine;New York Times;New York Times;Strategic National;Us Department Of Health,"TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,2627;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,180;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2217;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2766;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3000;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,180;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2217;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2766;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3000;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,2627;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2715;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2715;DELAY,539;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,539;HEALTH_VACCINATION,160;HEALTH_VACCINATION,418;HEALTH_VACCINATION,895;HEALTH_VACCINATION,2461;HEALTH_VACCINATION,3039;HEALTH_VACCINATION,3081;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,160;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,418;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,895;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,2461;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,3039;WB_642_CHILD_HEALTH,3081;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,160;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,418;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,895;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,2461;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,3039;WB_1459_IMMUNIZATIONS,3081;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,160;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,418;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,895;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2461;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3039;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3081;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,160;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,418;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,895;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,2461;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,3039;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,3081;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,160;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,418;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,895;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2461;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,3039;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,3081;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,2618;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,40;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,508;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,679;GENERAL_HEALTH,32;GENERAL_HEALTH,679;GENERAL_HEALTH,2668;MEDICAL,32;MEDICAL,679;MEDICAL,2668;TAX_DISEASE_OUTBREAK,2947;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,2947;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,2947;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,2947;ECON_STOCKMARKET,135;ECON_STOCKMARKET,3024;EDUCATION,2699;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2699;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,2727;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,2727;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,273;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2519;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,104;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,152;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,636;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,815;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1257;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1346;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1601;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,1700;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2061;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2453;TAX_DISEASE_MONKEYPOX,2581;WB_135_TRANSPORT,329;WB_135_TRANSPORT,2363;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,329;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,2363;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,329;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,2363;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,3107;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1189;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1278;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1233;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1322;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BAVARIAN,3118;",White House;New York;Denmark,655

246,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/world/tonga-eruption-water-climate-stratosphere-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. One of the most powerful volcanic eruptions on the planet blasted such a massive amount of water vapor high into the atmosphere that it’s likely to temporarily warm the Earth’s surface, according to detections from a NASA satellite.  When the undersea Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted on January 15, 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Tonga’s capital, it created a tsunami as well as a sonic boom that rippled around the world – twice.  The eruption sent a tall plume of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is located between 8 and 33 miles (12 and 53 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. It was enough water to fill 58,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to detections from a NASA satellite.   The detection was made by the Microwave Limb Sounder instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite. The satellite measures water vapor, ozone and other atmospheric gases. After the eruption occurred, the scientists were surprised by the water vapor readings. They estimate that the eruption delivered 146 teragrams of water to the stratosphere. One teragram is the equivalent of a trillion grams, and in this case, it was equal to 10% of the water already present in the stratosphere.  That’s nearly four times the amount of water vapor that reached the stratosphere after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines. A new study about the water vapor findings published in July in Geophysical Research Letters. “We’ve never seen anything like it,” said study author Luis Millán, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, in a statement.  “We had to carefully inspect all the measurements in the plume to make sure they were trustworthy.”  Keeping an eye on Earth The Microwave Limb Sounder instrument can measure natural signals of microwaves from Earth’s atmosphere and detect them even through thick ash clouds. “MLS was the only instrument with dense enough coverage to capture the water vapor plume as it happened, and the only one that wasn’t affected by the ash that the volcano released,” Millán said. The Aura satellite launched in 2004 and since then it has only measured two volcanic eruptions that lofted substantial water vapor so high up in the atmosphere. But the water vapor from the 2008 Kasatochi event in Alaska and the 2015 Calbuco eruption in Chile dissipated rather quickly.  Typically, powerful volcanic eruptions like Mount Pinatubo or the 1883 Krakatoa event in Indonesia cool Earth’s surface temperature because the gas, dust and ash they spew reflects sunlight into space. This “volcanic winter” happened after the Mount Tambora eruption in 1815, triggering “the year without a summer” in 1816. The Tonga eruption was different because the water vapor it sent into the atmosphere can trap heat, which could cause warmer surface temperatures. The excess water vapor could stay in the stratosphere for several years, according to the researchers. The additional water vapor in the stratosphere could also lead to chemical reactions that temporarily contribute to the depletion of Earth’s protective ozone. Anatomy of an eruption Fortunately, the warming effect of the water vapor is expected to be small and temporary, and will dissipate as the extra vapor diminishes. The researchers don’t believe it will be enough to exacerbate existing conditions due to the climate crisis.  The researchers believe the main reason for the amount of lofted water vapor was due to the depth of the volcano’s caldera 490 feet (150 meters) below the ocean’s surface.  If it was too deep, the depth of the ocean would have muted the eruption, and it was too shallow, the amount of seawater heated by the erupting magma wouldn’t have matched what reached the stratosphere, the researchers said. Scientists are still working to understand the unusually energetic eruption and all of its superlatives, including hurricane-strength winds that reached space.",,Geophysical Research Letters;Propulsion Laboratory;Cnn;Cnn,"NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANIC,179;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANIC,2383;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANIC,2443;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANIC,2568;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANIC,2799;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANIC,2979;NATURAL_DISASTER_MAGMA,4201;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1833;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTIONS,189;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTIONS,2578;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTIONS,2809;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANO,427;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANO,2336;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANO,3792;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANO,3843;NATURAL_DISASTER_VOLCANO,3995;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,581;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,1006;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,1093;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,1181;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,1288;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,1605;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,2392;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,2452;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,2731;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,3039;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,3111;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,3528;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,3824;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,3875;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,4124;NATURAL_DISASTER_ERUPTION,4354;NATURAL_DISASTER_TSUNAMI,505;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3768;AFFECT,2308;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,1821;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,1776;TAX_WEAPONS_BOMB,1154;TAX_WEAPONS_BOMB,1242;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1154;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1242;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3775;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,374;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,826;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,916;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,931;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,2509;WB_2120_SATELLITES,374;WB_2120_SATELLITES,826;WB_2120_SATELLITES,916;WB_2120_SATELLITES,931;WB_2120_SATELLITES,2509;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,374;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,826;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,916;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,931;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,2509;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,374;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,826;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,916;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,931;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2509;WB_137_WATER,242;WB_137_WATER,608;WB_137_WATER,733;WB_137_WATER,946;WB_137_WATER,1060;WB_137_WATER,1321;WB_137_WATER,1447;WB_137_WATER,1533;WB_137_WATER,1655;WB_137_WATER,2246;WB_137_WATER,2608;WB_137_WATER,2656;WB_137_WATER,3143;WB_137_WATER,3257;WB_137_WATER,3367;WB_137_WATER,3576;WB_137_WATER,3953;SCIENCE,37;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,3775;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,3775;TAX_FNCACT_ATMOSPHERIC_SCIENTIST,1821;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3191;",Indonesia;Calbuco;Philippines;Alaska;Hiroshima;Tonga;Mount Tambora;Chile;California,840

Facts The monument is located on Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota.     Sculptor Gutzon Borglum selected the four presidents to represent major events in the history of the United States: Washington represents the birth, Jefferson symbolizes the growth or expansion, Lincoln illustrates the preservation and Roosevelt embodies the development. It is carved in Harney Peak granite and each head is about 60 feet tall. The sculpture’s rate of erosion is estimated at one inch per 10,000 years. It stands 5,725 feet above sea level. It cost $989,992.32 to build. Over two million tourists visit each year. In 2021, 2,565,868 people visited the monument. Following 9/11, the Parks Service made various security enhancements, such as installing security fencing, lighting and gates; improving existing mechanical systems and purchasing all-terrain vehicles for use in patrols and at special events.  Timeline 1923 - The idea is suggested by Jonah “Doane” Robinson, secretary of the South Dakota State Historical Society. October 1, 1925 - Mount Rushmore is dedicated as a national monument. October 4, 1927 - Work begins on the monument. About four hundred workers sculpt the monument using dynamite and drills. Workers use much smaller models (about one-twelfth the size) to envision the final product.   July 4, 1930 - The section of George Washington is dedicated. June 10, 1933 - Franklin D. Roosevelt issues Executive Order 6166, making Mount Rushmore part of the National Park Service. August 30, 1936 - Thomas Jefferson’s section is dedicated. September 17, 1937 - Abraham Lincoln’s section is dedicated. July 2, 1939 - The Theodore Roosevelt section is dedicated. March 6, 1941 - Gutzon Borglum dies. His son, Lincoln Borglum, completes work on Mount Rushmore. October 31, 1941 - Drilling on the monument is complete. It only takes six and a half years of actual work on the monument, but the Great Depression slowed down its completion due to lack of federal funds.",Abraham Lincoln;Abraham Lincoln;Theodore Roosevelt;Theodore Roosevelt;Gutzon Borglum;Gutzon Borglum;Lincoln Borglum;Jonah Doane Robinson;George Washington;George Washington;Thomas Jefferson;Thomas Jefferson,National Park Service;Dakota State Historical Society;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,608;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1451;TAX_ECON_PRICE,853;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1524;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,1524;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,1524;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,1524;TAX_FNCACT_SCULPTOR,371;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1212;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1265;TAX_DISEASE_DEPRESSION,1903;NATURAL_DISASTER_EROSION,766;LEADER,165;LEADER,412;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENTS,165;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENTS,412;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,337;TOURISM,900;TAX_FNCACT_TOURISTS,900;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1042;",South Dakota;United States;Washington;Harney Peak;Mount Rushmore,484

His team repeats allegations that Twitter has misstated the number of fake and spam bot accounts on its platform — a central charge Musk has made to justify terminating the acquisition agreement after originally citing a desire to “defeat the spam bots” as a reason for buying the company.  Musk’s response, which was filed publicly on Friday, states that the billionaire’s team conducted an analysis of fake and spam accounts on the platform using data provided by Twitter’s “firehose” of tweets and a public tool called Botometer created by researchers at the University of Indiana. It did not further detail the process of that evaluation and added that its analysis was “constrained” by a lack of time and information from Twitter.  Based on that analysis, Musk alleges that during the first week of July, spam bots accounted for 33% of visible accounts on the platform and about 10% of Twitter’s monetizable daily active users, or mDAU. (Twitter, for its part, has consistently reported that spam and fake bot accounts make up less than 5% of its mDAU.) Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) has repeatedly denied Musk’s claims about the prevalence of spam bots on the platform. Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) Board Chair Bret Taylor tweeted on Thursday evening a link to the company’s response to his answer and counterclaims. (Musk’s team had filed a confidential version of the answer last week to give Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) time to review it for company information that should be redacted, before making it publicly available Friday.) Taylor called Musk’s claims “factually inaccurate, legally insufficient, and commercially irrelevant.”   In its response, Twitter takes issue with Musk’s analysis of spam bots, saying that the “firehose” of data he used “reflects many Twitter accounts that are not included in mDAU” and that the Botometer tool he used relies on a different process than the company to determine whether an account may be a bot. It added that Botometer “earlier this year designed Musk himself as highly likely to be a bot.”  The back-and-forth between Twitter and Musk offers a preview of the arguments each side will make when the case goes to trial, assuming they don’t agree to a settlement first. A five-day trial is set to kick off on October 17, after Twitter had pressed to expedite the proceedings. Musk last month moved to terminate his agreement to buy Twitter, accusing the company of breaching the deal by making misleading statements about the number of bot accounts on its platform and withholding information that he claims could help him evaluate the issue. Days later, Twitter filed a lawsuit against the billionaire, alleging that he’d violated the agreement and asking a court to compel him to follow through with the deal.   In addition to doubling down on concerns about bot accounts, Musk’s responses also criticized Twitter’s use of monetizable daily active users, a metric Twitter publicly reports to advertisers and shareholders to represent its growth.  Musk claims that his evaluations show only a small portion of the users Twitter considers mDAU actually generate significant revenue for the company by viewing and engaging with advertisements, alleging that the measure is not actually as good an indicator of future revenue growth potential and long-term performance as Twitter’s public filings imply.   “Twitter also does not publish the methodology it follows to determine its mDAU count, or how it excludes nonmonetizable accounts from that metric,” Musk’s answer states. “Thus, it is extremely difficult for any third party to completely recreate Twitter’s mDAU calculations.”  Musk’s answer alleges Twitter leadership has incentives to report “high mDAU numbers to stoke investor interest” and because its executive compensation structure is based partly on mDAU.  In its answer, Musk’s team explains that the billionaire is concerned with the spam bot issue because “transitioning users who do not generate any revenue into more active users … is no easy task.” Musk’s team adds: “A company focused on adding these active users would invest substantial resources towards trying to improve Twitter to maximize engagement, such as by effectively targeting spam or false accounts.” Twitter said in its response to Musk’s counterclaims that its mDAU count has never purported to show how many users generate significant revenue by interacting with ads, but rather shows the number of real users who could be monetized by being shown ads. It also noted that Musk’s mDAU-related claims were not included in his initial termination filing and “are a newly invented litigating position.”  The company also continues to claim that the issue of bots is not, and has never been, germane to the completion of the acquisition deal. “Musk has received massive amounts of information from Twitter, for months, and has been unable to find a valid excuse to back out of the contract,” Twitter’s response states.   In a letter to Twitter employees that was included in Friday’s regulatory filing, Twitter General Counsel Sean Edgett said that while Twitter had the opportunity to request redactions in Musk’s answer, it chose not to. (Twitter had previously sent a letter to the judge overseeing the case asking her to ensure Musk’s team would not file the public answer early so they would have enough time to review it for potential redactions.)    “We chose not to redact any information–we fully stand behind our SEC filings, the methodologies we use to calculate mDAU, and our statements about the percentage of spam accounts on our platform,” Edgett said in the letter.

545,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/media/fbi-search-mar-a-lago-reliable-sources/,"A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.  Reporters who cover sensitive beats sometimes have a sense when big news is about to break. But not this time. The FBI’s Monday morning search of Mar-a-Lago – a thunderclap in American political history – happened so quietly, so secretly, that it wasn’t caught on camera at all. For the most part reporters didn’t catch wind of the FBI action until after it was over. By the time local TV news cameras showed up outside the club, there was almost nothing to see. Websites used file photos of the Florida resort since there were no dramatic shots of the search. What everyone wants to see is the search warrant. As Elie Honig pointed out right away on CNN, “in order to get a search warrant in the federal system, prosecutors have to establish probable cause that a crime was committed,” and a judge has to sign off. The warrant may become public later. But for the time being we’re only seeing leaks from anonymous sources; interpretations from analysts; and incendiary responses from Trump family members, friends and supporters. ‪Mark Levin said on Fox that “this is the worst attack on this republic in modern history, period.”‬ The hyperbolic, man-the-battle-stations reactions are a big part of the story because they showcase where GOP leaders and stars stand – solidly right next to Trump regardless of potential wrongdoing.  First four hours of coverage This feels like a “where were you when?” moment of the Trump era – an era that is very much overlapping with the Biden era. But its ultimate level of import is impossible to judge right now. So here are some notes about the first four hours of media coverage: – Trump tried to manage the news by announcing it himself in a lengthy screed. Trump and some of his allies “have a long-standing habit of conflating legal problems with PR problems,” Maggie Haberman said on CNN. “At the moment, they are treating this like it’s a PR problem,” she added, “but it’s a legal problem…” – Within an hour, sources told reporters that the search warrant was related to an investigation into the handling of presidential documents that may have been brought to Mar-a-Lago. In other words: Not the 1/6 investigation. – CNN’s Gabby Orr reported that Trump attorney Christina Bobb, a former host on One America News, was present for the Mar-a-Lago search. – Trump’s statement supplied many of the talking points that were immediately used on Fox, Newsmax, and across the right-wing web. The MAGA media message is: The government is corrupt, the FBI is a threat to real Americans, the Democrats are to blame, and the Republicans are going to correct it. – “Republicans — formerly the party of ‘law and order’ — are absolutely panicking and calling for the defunding/dismantling of the entire FBI,” Jezebel’s Laura Bassett wrote, citing tweets from Marjorie Taylor Greene and numerous GOP media stars. – Trump was “purposely painting himself as a martyr to undermine the FBI & DOJ — all while signaling a call to arms to his supporters,” former VP Pence adviser Olivia Troye tweeted. “Fox News & many in the GOP are emboldening it. Far-right social media is buzzing with violence…” – When Trump left Trump Tower in NYC on Monday evening, he did not respond to shouted questions from reporters about the FBI. – All of this is happening “on the 48th anniversary of Richard Nixon announcing his resignation,” Stephanie Ruhle said on MSNBC.  Silence from DOJ “Justice Department officials are declining to comment on any aspect of the search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago and have declined to say if Attorney General Merrick B. Garland approved of the warrant — or even if he had been briefed on the situation,” the NYT’s Glenn Thrush noted on the news outlet’s live blog. The agency will have to say something on Tuesday morning, right?   Bad timing for Biden? “A White House official said it was not notified about the search,” CNN’s story says. President Biden, “a senior administration official said, was unaware of the search of Mar-a-Lago until after it was reported on the news.” MAGA media is full of speculation to the contrary, but Sam Stein made this point on Twitter: “The idea that they’d want this seems….suspect. The rare time they’re in a great news cycle seems like an odd time to trample over it…”  Trump’s “disinfo supply” While government entities are staying quiet about the investigation, Trump allies are being loud. Eric Trump went on Sean Hannity’s show; reiterated his father’s victimhood narrative; and confirmed that the search warrant related to the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents.  Some of the initial news alerts about the FBI action were untrue because, true to form, some parts of Trump’s statement were untrue. He said his home was “currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” but all the reliable reporting indicated that the FBI action had concluded by the time he spoke out.  Trump’s statement also contained “a fun instance of Trump getting high on his own disinfo supply,” NBC’s Ben Collins pointed out. “He mentions Hillary Clinton ‘acid washing 33,000 E-mails.’ In reality, an IT guy used an app called BleachBit. In Trumpworld, she poured literal acid on the emails.”  This Florida reporter was the first to know Via Slate: “The news of the raid was first reported by Peter Schorsch, the publisher of Florida Politics, a news organization that closely covers congressional and down ballot races in the state.” He tweeted about it at 6:36pm, citing two sources. I immediately texted it to Oliver Darcy and said “wonder if this is real.” Darcy said he figured “Trump will rant about it online” – and he was right. Trump’s statement followed within minutes. >> More: “In a phone call with Slate, Schorsch said that he had heard about the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago from a ‘longtime source in Republican politics who has a law enforcement background’ and knew a lot about ‘south Florida law enforcement…’”  Earlier in the day… The day began with reminders that the Trump era is far from over. Susan Glasser and Peter Baker came out with the excerpt from their September book “The Divider” that we previewed in Sunday night’s newsletter. And Maggie Haberman, ahead of her October launch of “Confidence Man,” shared photos of documents that Trump was said to have flushed down toilets. Both books surged on Amazon’s new releases list on Monday thanks to preorders.",Mark Levin;Peter Schorsch;Jezebel Laura Bassett;Christina Bobb;Marjorie Taylor Greene;Susan Glasser;Ben Collins;Olivia Troye;Maggie Haberman;Maggie Haberman;Peter Baker;Oliver Darcy;Sam Stein;Stephanie Ruhle;Sean Hannity;Richard Nixon;Elie Honig;Eric Trump;Hillary Clinton;Gabby Orr,Msnbc;Twitter;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,5526;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2684;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,2723;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,666;CORRUPTION,2595;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,1385;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2635;SANITATION,6399;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,315;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,1155;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,3095;ACT_MAKESTATEMENT,3568;TAX_FNCACT_AGENTS,4923;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;LEADER,4011;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4011;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,1187;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,2501;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,3147;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,3941;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,4052;MEDIA_SOCIAL,3210;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,3210;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,3210;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,3210;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,1081;TRIAL,854;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,854;EXTREMISM,2536;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2584;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,4406;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLISHER,5450;MEDIA_MSM,147;MEDIA_MSM,436;MEDIA_MSM,2094;MEDIA_MSM,3365;KILL,3613;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,325;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,5340;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,4549;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1734;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2556;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2951;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3210;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,4149;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1734;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2556;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2951;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3210;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,4149;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1734;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2556;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2951;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3210;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,4149;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2150;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2278;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,4457;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2150;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2278;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4457;WB_840_JUSTICE,2150;WB_840_JUSTICE,2278;WB_840_JUSTICE,4457;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2150;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2278;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,4457;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2150;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2278;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,4457;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2150;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2278;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,4457;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,2150;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,2278;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,4457;RESIGNATION,3460;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,926;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1673;TAX_DISEASE_THRUSH,3790;SOC_GENERALCRIME,900;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,900;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,2651;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2651;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,3121;BLOCKADE,4870;SEIGE,4870;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2324;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3661;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5931;ARMEDCONFLICT,3009;SECURITY_SERVICES,5966;SECURITY_SERVICES,6025;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,5966;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,6025;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,5966;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,6025;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,5966;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,6025;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1234;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,6321;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,3932;LEGISLATION,2757;LEGISLATION,5954;LEGISLATION,6013;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2757;EPU_POLICY_LAW,5954;EPU_POLICY_LAW,6013;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3543;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3235;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3235;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,3235;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,2617;",Trump Tower;Americans;America;New York;Florida;American,1393
537,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/health/ashton-kutcher-vasculitis-wellness/,"Ashton Kutcher revealed Monday he had battled a serious autoimmune disease that affected his hearing, sight and ability to walk for more than a year. “Like two years ago, I had this weird, super-rare form of vasculitis,” Kutcher said in an exclusive video clip released to “Access Hollywood” from an upcoming episode of National Geographic’s “Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge.” “Knocked out my vision, knocked out my hearing, knocked out like all my equilibrium. It took me like a year to like build it all back up,” Kutcher told adventurer and presenter Bear Grylls as they hiked through brambles and trees. “You don’t really appreciate it until it’s gone, until you go, ‘I don’t know if I’m ever gonna be able to see again. I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to hear again, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to walk again,” Kutcher said. “I’m lucky to be alive.” CNN has reached out to Kutcher’s representative but has not yet received a response.   Complications from vasculitis took the life of actor-director Harold Ramis in 2014, Ramis’ agents said. Ramis, who directed “Caddyshack,” “National Lampoon’s Vacation” and “Groundhog Day,” and costarred in “Ghostbusters” and “Stripes,” died at 69, four years after contracting the condition. Symptoms of vasculitis  Vasculitis occurs when the body’s immune system attacks veins, arteries and small capillaries. The resulting inflammation narrows those blood vessels and restricts the flow of blood or even cuts blood flow off entirely, possibly causing organ damage or creating aneurysms (a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel), according to the National Institutes of Health. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause internal bleeding which can lead to death.  Depending on the specific type and severity of the condition and which organs are targeted, symptoms of vasculitis vary and can be mild, moderate or life-threatening. Common symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, rash, aches, pains and fever. Age, ethnicity, family history and lifestyle factors such as smoking and illegal drug use can contribute to the risk for vasculitis. Certain medications for high blood pressure, thyroid disease and infections can contribute as well, the NIH noted. Vasculitis can occur alone or in conjunction with other rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or scleroderma. Having a hepatitis B or C infection can also be a trigger, as can blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation. For mild cases, over-the-counter pain medicines can help. For more severe cases, doctors may prescribe steroids, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulators or immunosuppressive medications, to name a few.",Mila Kunis;Mila Kunis;Mila Kunis;Ashton Kutcher;Ashton Kutcher;Ashton Kutcher;Ashton Kutcher;Harold Ramis;Bear Grylls;Sanjay Gupta,National Lampoon Vacation;National Institutes Of Health;National Geographic Running Wild;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"WB_1431_CANCER,2754;TAX_DISEASE_INFECTION,2709;TAX_DISEASE_AUTOIMMUNE_DISEASE,79;GENERAL_HEALTH,79;GENERAL_HEALTH,2353;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,79;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,2353;WB_1406_DISEASES,79;WB_1406_DISEASES,2353;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,79;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,2353;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,79;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,2353;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASES,2620;TAX_DISEASE_SCLERODERMA,2673;MARITIME_INCIDENT,1611;MARITIME,1611;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1611;TAX_DISEASE_HEPATITIS,2693;HEALTH_SEXTRANSDISEASE,2693;TAX_DISEASE_RHEUMATOID_ARTHRITIS,2651;TAX_DISEASE_LEUKEMIA,2771;TAX_DISEASE_ANEURYSM,1833;TAX_DISEASE_INFLAMMATION,1583;TAX_DISEASE_INFLAMMATION,2829;AFFECT,93;MEDICAL,1817;MEDICAL,2423;MEDICAL,2538;TAX_DISEASE_RHEUMATIC_DISEASES,2620;TAX_DISEASE_HIGH_BLOOD_PRESSURE,2335;WB_1432_HYPERTENSION,2335;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,2335;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BEAR,365;TAX_DISEASE_WEIGHT_LOSS,2116;CRIME_ILLEGAL_DRUGS,2244;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,913;KILL,1394;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1394;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTORS,2917;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,2917;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,2244;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,2244;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,2244;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2244;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2244;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,2244;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,208;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,1203;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,1462;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,1475;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,2012;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,2290;TAX_DISEASE_VASCULITIS,2557;TAX_DISEASE_HEPATITIS_B,2695;TAX_DISEASE_ARTHRITIS,2651;TAX_CHRONICDISEASE_ARTHRITIS,2651;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1709;",Hollywood,608

The long-awaited merger of the two services will debut in the US next summer before being rolled out overseas, Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Thursday during its second quarter earnings call. The company did not say if the new offering would have a different name than HBO Max and did not announce pricing for the new service.  Warner Bros. Discovery added that it plans to have 130 million global subscriptions with its streaming offering by 2025. The announcement that the two services would be combined isn’t exactly new. Warner Bros. Discovery, which is also the parent company of CNN, has been open about bringing together its two streaming services since the creation of Warner Bros. Discovery this spring.  However, it’s a notable move considering that the service would be a heavy hitter in scripted entertainment with HBO and in the unscripted entertainment realm with Discovery+. The company said that in the second quarter of 2022, HBO, HBO Max and Discovery+ had a combined 92.1 million subscribers, which is up 1.7 million subscribers from the prior quarter. The company said that it would announce more information around the service at an investor event it plans before the end of the year.

532,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/mike-pompeo-january-6-committee/,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the House January 6 committee on Tuesday, according to panel member Rep. Zoe Lofgren. The California Democrat confirmed CNN’s earlier reporting that Pompeo would be deposed by the committee, according to a source familiar with the matter.  CNN has previously reported on Pompeo’s negotiations with the committee about his testimony. The panel has shown an increased interest in members of former President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, particularly regarding conversations among Cabinet members about invoking the 25th Amendment after January 6, 2021, and the committee’s focus in the Pompeo interview was expected to be on the 25th Amendment, the source said. A portion of the 25th Amendment, which addresses presidential succession, allows a vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to vote to remove a president from office due to his inability to “discharge the powers and duties of his office.”  Pompeo served as CIA director for the first year of Trump’s presidency, and led the State Department for Trump’s final three years, where he was a stalwart Trump ally and defender. Lofgren refused to comment on the particulars of Pompeo’s testimony in an interview on Tuesday, but told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” that “he came in willingly, and he did answer questions for quite some time.” When asked if the committee learned any new information from Pompeo’s testimony, Lofgren said, “I think we fill in a few pieces here and there each time we interview someone. Obviously, we’ve had testimony from others about what he said and did. And so, it’s just a matter of filling out the entire picture, especially on that day and the events subsequent to that day, where the Cabinet secretaries had concerns about the President.”  The New York Times was first to report Pompeo’s expected appearance Tuesday. As discussions surrounding the 25th Amendment come into focus, the committee had also hoped to hear from Doug Mastriano, the Trump-endorsed Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.  However, Mastriano’s virtual appearance Tuesday only lasted about 15 minutes and “he didn’t answer a single question,” according to a source familiar with the matter. Mastriano’s attorney cut off the virtual appearance soon after it began, the source said. His lawyer, Tim Parlatore, took issue with several procedural matters related to the deposition, and raised questions about the legality of the subpoena that Mastriano received from the panel, the source added. Mastriano, a key figure in Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, led a faux legislative “hearing” at a hotel in Gettysburg a few weeks after the 2020 election, where Trump and his then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani made false claims about election fraud. He also chartered buses to bring Trump supporters to Washington on January 6, and he was briefly in charge of the Pennsylvania state Senate’s partisan “audit” of the 2020 election. Last week, Mastriano threatened to walk out of a scheduled deposition before the House select committee unless the panel agreed to his conditions, potentially setting up a court fight over his testimony. In a letter to the committee, his attorney, Parlatore had said he would pull out of the scheduled deposition unless they could agree to certain accommodations. Parlatore asked that he be able to videotape the deposition, keep the footage in escrow, and release portions of it later on, if the committee publicly releases clips that he believes would require additional context. Several Trump Cabinet officials have already met with the committee, including Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. Attorney General William Barr also met with the committee, but he had left the administration prior to the January 6 insurrection. This story has been updated with additional background information.

386,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/indiana-state-house-abortion-bill/,"Gov. Eric Holcomb on Friday signed a bill that would ban most abortions in Indiana – making it the first state to pass a restrictive law against the procedure since Roe v. Wade was overturned this summer.  The Indiana House and Senate passed the GOP-sponsored bill earlier Friday.  The new law provides exceptions for when the life of the mother is at risk and for fatal fetal anomalies, up to 20 weeks post-fertilization. It also allows exceptions for some abortions if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. It will go into effect on September 15. Current Indiana law allows abortions up to 20 weeks after fertilization (or 22 weeks after the mother’s last menstrual period).  The US Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate a federal right to abortion sent the issue back to the states, and several Republican leaders have pledged to curtail access. West Virginia also has reconvened a special session, though its near-total abortion ban remains in limbo after the Republican-led legislature could not come to a consensus and adjourned, leaving abortion legal until 20 weeks post-fertilization. And in Kansas, voters this week handily defeated an effort to amend the state’s constitution to remove the right to abortion. On Thursday, the Indiana House rejected Republican-sponsored amendments that would have removed the exceptions for rape, incest and fatal fetal anomalies from the bill. Members of House Republican leadership were divided as Speaker Todd Huston and Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Karickhoff voted against the amendments, while Majority Leader Matt Lehman backed the amendments.   A House amendment also failed Thursday that would have placed a non-binding question on the 2022 general election ballot as to whether abortion should remain legal in Indiana.  White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre slammed the new law in a statement Saturday, calling the bill’s passage “another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women’s reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.” Emotional debate Friday’s vote in the state House followed an emotional and sometimes contentious debate during which protesters’ cheers and jeers could be heard amid lawmakers’ speeches.   GOP House Rep. John Jacob of Indianapolis, who supports a total ban on abortion, said on the House floor Friday said he would not support the bill because it “regulates abortion, which is baby murder,” while calling on his colleagues to repent before God.  Democratic Rep. Renee Pack of Indianapolis later fired back at Jacob and spoke of her own abortion in 1990 when she served in the US military. “It took me getting to this statehouse for my colleagues to call me a murderer. I had to get that kind of abuse in this room, in this chamber. Sir, I am not a murderer, and my sisters are not murderers either,” Pack said on Friday. “We are pro-choice. That is what we are. We believe that we have command over our own bodies.”  During Friday’s debate, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle lamented the time crunch they were under to consider such a difficult topic.  “We are all trying, we are all discerning, none of us are sleeping, none of us are doing well. We’re walking around with … knots in our stomachs,” state Rep. Ann Vermilion, a Republican from Marion, said on the floor Friday ahead of the vote.  “Everyone of us, 150, have cried this week and we are all trying to do the will of the people while equally being true to our faith and our core beliefs,” she said. Particular attention has been placed on Indiana after a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio crossed state lines to get an abortion in June, after Roe was overturned.  The Indiana doctor who provided abortion services for the 10-year-old girl said the Indiana abortion bill “is going to hurt Hoosier women.”  “Medicine is not about exceptions,” Dr. Caitlin Bernard told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day” earlier Friday. “I can’t even begin to tell you how many patients I see in very unique situations that can’t fit in to those exceptions, that can’t have a list of what I can and can’t do. They can’t wait to check with their lawyer, I can’t wait to check with my lawyer, I need to be able to take care of patients when and where they need that care.”  This story has been updated with additional reaction.

669,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/investing/trump-spac-dwac-merger/,"After facing a series of regulatory obstacles, the shell company attempting to take over former President Donald Trump’s social media platform needs to extend a looming deadline to complete the controversial deal. Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), disclosed late Friday it is seeking shareholder approval to delay the September 8 deadline by a year to allow time to consummate its planned acquisition of Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group. Shares of the blank-check company fell 3% Monday morning. Truth Social, which had a messy launch earlier this year, aims to be an alternative to traditional social media and has promised to “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.”  The efforts to buy time come as the deal faces a flurry of legal issues and regulatory scrutiny amid what experts have warned are red flags about the transaction.  In late June, Digital World, revealed its board members have received subpoenas from a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York related to due diligence regarding the deal. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the transaction. “While we are using our best efforts to complete the business combination as soon as practicable, our board of directors believes there will not be sufficient time before the termination date,” Digital World said in the new filing. That’s why Digital World is asking shareholders to extend the deadline until September 8, 2023. Without the extension, the shell company said it may be “forced to liquidate” without a deal in hand.   The DOJ and SEC investigations have served as major roadblocks to getting the deal consummated, according to the filing. “We have experienced a number of regulatory delays, and we and TMTG may continue to experience additional delays in the future,” Digital World said in the filing. “These delays could cause us to be unable to consummate the business combination.” The filing indicates the regulatory headwinds facing the Trump deal are “formidable” and “really hits home the possibility that the deal is terminated due to regulatory headwinds,” said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital.  “The SEC and DOJ are not known for moving fast or trying to speed things along to help the SPAC,” Kennedy said. “In some cases, indefinite delays can increase the likelihood that the deal is essentially terminated.”",Donald Trump,Digital World Acquisition Corp,"LEADER,125;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,125;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,125;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,57;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,151;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,151;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,151;MEDIA_SOCIAL,151;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,151;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,151;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,151;",New York,469
509,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-public-opinion-military-response-pelosi-intl-hnk-mic/,"Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here. As a US Air Force jet carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi approached Taiwan on Tuesday night, expectations ran high in China over how Beijing would respond. Since reports emerged that the key US lawmaker would visit Taiwan during an Asia tour, conversation in China had churned with nationalist furor and amped-up rhetoric on what the leadership could do about it.  Beijing had earlier threatened Washington that those who “play with fire” over Taiwan would “perish,” and warned the US against crossing a “red line,” saying the Chinese military would “not sit idly by” if Pelosi visited the self-governing island, which China’s Communist Party claims as its territory, despite never having controlled it.  Voices outside the government, including former Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin, had been more direct, saying China could take military action against Pelosi’s plane – raising the public’s expectations of a showdown. Instead, Pelosi and her congressional delegation landed on the tarmac in Taipei’s Songshan Airport, where they were greeted in a live-streamed welcome by Taiwanese officials while the iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper flashed “US-Taiwan friendship forever” in brightly lit text and crowds, of both supporters and protesters, gathered outside Pelosi’s hotel to await her arrival. As Taiwan rolled out the red carpet, China’s government ministries fired off a raft of condemnations, while its military pledged to launch extensive, multiday military exercises, and on Thursday fired missiles over the island – a first for China. But China’s initial actions stopped short of what was expected by some of its domestic audience. And within China’s online sphere, where nationalistic voices dominate its highly censored social media, disappointment was high.  “I don’t know where to hang my head. This is so shameful. People outside the Great Firewall are laughing their heads off. (China’s) literally a ‘paper tiger,’” wrote one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo social media platform. Others asked why there was so much hype for so little action. But in the days since, a reckoning, and a reset, have been unfolding in China. In an attempt to reverse the dissatisfaction, state media have mobilized to drum up support for China’s response, portraying its military drills as strong and “unprecedented.” Social media platforms have been inundated with news of those exercises, and other voices in the public arena have lauded China for what they call a successful, strategic response and decried what they saw as warmongering. Resetting the narrative One target for this pushback has been Hu, the former editor of state-backed tabloid Global Times, seen as a key voice revving up nationalist sentiment in recent days. On Thursday, the influential “Chairman Rabbit” account on messaging platform WeChat, run by blogger Ren Yi, said China’s actions had matched the tone conveyed by the government, but not the predictions of the former Global Times editor.  “The Chinese government has indeed formulated very strong and proud countermeasures, which have been very successful in handling this issue of Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan,” said the post. “As a result (of Hu’s remarks), on the evening of August 2, when the Chinese government and official media solemnly announced the military exercises and series of countermeasures against Taiwan, netizens did not cheer for these unprecedentedly powerful measures, nor did they feel the unprecedented high morale, great excitement from people’s hearts, or the boiling patriotic sentiment,” the post said. Another popular online commentator, Geng Xiangshun, said the public’s patriotism was “very good,” but calls for war were unwise – though he did not mention Hu. “You must know that the ultimate goal is to realize the reunification of the motherland at the minimum cost, not to start a war,” he wrote on his Weibo account. Hu defended himself in a post on Thursday, saying his “heavy words” had value in influencing discussion around Pelosi’s visit, including in Washington, adding the “patriotic camp” should have “diverse” voices. As these conversations played out, some social media users appeared to rethink their disappointment, with one writing Thursday evening that the decision makers were actually “wise” and “logical.” “Now I understand,” one user said in a post with thousands of likes. ‘Rational patriots’ But the apparent need to ease disappointment and promote China’s response also highlights the risks leader Xi Jinping has taken in stoking nationalistic feelings. “Nationalism has grown under Xi Jinping, because Xi continuously uses this for his purpose, to advance his agenda, but I don’t think he ever understood the negative side, because he thinks he can stir nationalism, but also stop it,” said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.  However, on this occasion, Beijing appears to have brought the narrative back under control, while Hu has become a scapegoat for stirring up nationalist sentiment, Wu said.  “‘Wolf warriors’ sometimes need to pay the price,” Wu said, using a common term for Beijing’s combative, nationalist opinion leaders and diplomats. Asked on Wednesday about the initial online backlash over China’s response, Assistant Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying gave a telling response. “We have full confidence in the ability of our country and our government to firmly defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Hua said. “The Chinese people are rational patriots.” CNN’s Beijing bureau contributed to this report.",Geng Xiangshun;Alfred Wu;Ren Yi;Nancy Pelosi,China Communist Party;A Us Air;Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public;National University Of Singapore;Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,6078;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,1197;KILL,697;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,5407;ARMEDCONFLICT,4249;ARMEDCONFLICT,4421;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,4249;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,4421;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,5981;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,1337;LEADER,420;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKER,420;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,420;TAX_FNCACT_SUPPORTERS,1482;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,868;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,5050;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RABBIT,3182;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,255;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_WOLF,5850;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,3641;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2162;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2396;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2732;MEDIA_SOCIAL,4732;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2162;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2396;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,2732;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,4732;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2162;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2396;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,2732;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,4732;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2162;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2396;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,2732;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,4732;TAX_FNCACT_DECISION_MAKERS,4838;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,962;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1780;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3311;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3395;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3630;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6222;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,962;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1780;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3311;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3395;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,3630;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6222;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,743;UNREST_ULTIMATUM,743;EDUCATION,5380;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,5380;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2162;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2396;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2607;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2732;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3647;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,4732;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2162;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2396;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2607;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2732;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3647;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,4732;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2162;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2396;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2607;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2732;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3647;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,4732;RETALIATE,4018;RETALIATE,4113;PROTEST,1495;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,862;MARITIME_INCIDENT,1808;MARITIME,1808;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,3028;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,3369;USPEC_POLICY1,5424;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,5424;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,222;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,6092;SOVEREIGNTY,6255;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,3175;MILITARY,228;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,5451;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1579;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1659;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,2693;TAX_ECON_PRICE,4400;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_TIGER,2341;TAX_FNCACT_WARRIOR,5858;INTERNET_CENSORSHIP,2281;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIRPORT,1272;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1272;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1272;WB_1804_AIRPORTS,1272;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1347;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,5525;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,5620;WB_346_COMPETITIVE_INDUSTRIES,5525;WB_346_COMPETITIVE_INDUSTRIES,5620;WB_818_INDUSTRY_POLICY_AND_REAL_SECTORS,5525;WB_818_INDUSTRY_POLICY_AND_REAL_SECTORS,5620;WB_1281_MANUFACTURING,5525;WB_1281_MANUFACTURING,5620;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,764;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,3384;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,3619;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6303;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,764;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,3384;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,3619;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6303;",Taiwan;Hong Kong;Taiwan Strait;Xijin;Chinese;Washington;Songshan;Beijing;Taipei;Taiwanese;China,1167

441,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/investing/strong-dollar/,"The US dollar has been on a tear this year. That’s good news for American tourists gallivanting around Europe, but bad news for pretty much every other country in the world. The greenback is up more than 10% in 2022 compared to other top currencies — near its highest level in two decades — as investors worried about a global recession have rushed to scoop up dollars, which are considered a safe haven in turbulent times. Adding to the dollar’s appeal is the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to tackle decades-high inflation. That’s made American investments more attractive, since they now offer higher returns. US travelers may be rejoicing that a night out in Rome that once cost $100 now costs about $80, but it’s a more complicated picture for multinational companies and foreign governments. About half of international trade is invoiced in dollars, running up bills for manufacturers and small businesses that rely on imported goods. Governments that need to repay their debts in dollars could also run into trouble, especially if reserves run low. The dollar’s gain is already hurting some vulnerable economies. A shortage of dollars in Sri Lanka contributed to the worst economic crisis in the country’s history, ultimately forcing its president out of office last month. Pakistan’s rupee plunged to a record low against the dollar in late July, pushing it to the brink of default. And Egypt — battered by rising food prices — is dealing with a depleted store of dollars and an exodus of foreign investment. All three countries have had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help. “It’s been a challenging environment,” said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.  Why the ‘dollar smile’ leads to frowns The US dollar tends to climb in value when America’s economy is very strong, or, somewhat counterintuitively, when it’s weak and the world is facing a recession. In either situation, investors view the country’s currency as an opportunity to lock in growth, or as a relatively secure place to park cash while they ride out the storm.  The phenomenon is often referred to as the “dollar smile,” since it rises at both extremes. But the rest of the world is left with less to grin about. Manik Narain, head of cross-asset strategy for emerging markets at UBS, identified three main reasons that a stronger dollar could hurt countries around the world with smaller economies. 1. It can add fiscal strain. Not every country has the ability to borrow money in their local currency, since foreign investors may not have faith in their institutions or they have less developed financial markets. That means some have no choice but to issue debt denominated in dollars. But if the value of the dollar shoots up, that makes it more expensive to repay their liabilities, draining government coffers.  It also makes it costlier for governments or businesses to import food, medicine and fuel.  That’s what happened when the value of Sri Lanka’s rupee crashed against the dollar earlier this year. The government drained its foreign reserves, which were already low in part due to a slump in tourism during the pandemic. Shortages of essential items then brought thousands of people to the streets. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned in July after angry protesters occupied government buildings. 2. It feeds capital flight. When a country’s currency dramatically weakens, wealthy individuals, companies and foreign investors start withdrawing their money, hoping to stash it somewhere safer. That pushes the currency down even lower, exacerbating fiscal problems. “If you’re sitting in Sri Lanka at the moment and you’re seeing the government is under pressure, you want to get your money out,” Narain said. 3. It weighs on growth. If firms can’t afford the imports they need to run their businesses, they won’t have as much inventory. That means they won’t be able to sell as much, even if demand stays robust, weighing on economic output.  When the US economy is chugging along, that can cushion some of the blow. Many emerging markets export goods to the world’s biggest economy. But when the dollar strengthens because America is on the brink of recession? That’s tough. “That can inflict more pain on the markets because you don’t have the silver lining of better economic growth in the background,” Narain said. A crisis contained The dollar has pulled back 0.6% in the past week. But it’s not expected to meaningfully reverse course any time soon.  “We look for dollar strength to remain largely intact in the near-to-intermediate term,” Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, wrote in a recent note to clients.   That’s pushing investors and policymakers to ask whether Sri Lanka is just the first domino to fall. There is also a risk that turmoil in emerging markets could spread across the financial ecosystem, triggering a wide range of spillover effects. Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote recently that he’s monitoring Tunisia, which is struggling to meet its budgetary needs, as well as Ghana and Kenya, which have high debt loads. El Salvador has a bond payment coming up early next year, while Argentina continues to struggle in the wake of its last currency crisis in 2018. The IMF has estimated that 60% of low-income countries are in or at high risk of government debt distress, compared to about one-fifth a decade ago.   But there are also key differences between the current situation and past crises. Dollar-denominated debt is less common than it used to be. The biggest players — such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia — “generally haven’t borrowed a lot in foreign currency and now hold enough foreign exchange reserves to manage their external debt load,” according to Setser. Plus, prices of commodities like oil and base metals remain high. That helps emerging economies that are major exporters, including many in Latin America, and serves as a reliable way to ensure dollars are still flowing to government coffers.  Inflation also pushed central banks in many emerging markets to start hiking rates earlier than peers at the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England. Brazil has raised borrowing costs at 12 consecutive meetings, having kicked off the process in March 2021.  Still, much could hinge on the fate of the world’s two biggest economies: the United States and China. If these engines of growth really begin to stall, then emerging markets could see a painful outflow of investment. “It will be critical whether the United States goes into recession,” said Robin Brooks, chief economist at Institute of International Finance. “It makes everybody more risk averse.” ",Manik Narain;Scott Wren;Gotabaya Rajapaksa;Robin Brooks;William Jackson;Brad Setser,International Monetary Fund;Institute Of International;Wells Fargo Investment Institute;Council On Foreign Relations;Federal Reserve;Federal Reserve;United States;United States,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3102;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3318;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3605;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,3962;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,5661;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6414;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,49;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,470;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,1122;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,1405;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,2003;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,2041;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,2410;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,2632;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,3012;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,3284;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,4423;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,4670;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,4793;LEADER,1321;LEADER,3507;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_US_DOLLAR,49;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_US_DOLLAR,2041;",Indonesia;Brazil;Mexico;Pakistan;London;Argentina;Ghana;Kenya;United States;America;Rome;Sri Lankan;Tunisia;El Salvador;Sri Lanka;American;China,1351
496,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-killings-sunday/,"A 27-year-old Muslim man killed last week in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is being remembered as a “brilliant public servant” committed to “improving conditions and inclusivity for disadvantaged minorities,” according to the mayor of the city he worked for. Police believe the death of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain on August 1 could be linked to the killings of three other Muslim men. The most recent killing, which Albuquerque police were alerted to Friday night, came a day after authorities determined there was a connection between the killings of Hussain and 41-year-old Aftab Hussein, who, like Hussain was from Pakistan. Detectives are working to determine whether the November killing of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan killed outside a business he ran with his brother, was also related.  Authorities are now looking for a “vehicle of interest” they say is potentially connected to the murders, Albuquerque Police Department Deputy Chief Cecily Parker said Sunday. The car is described as a dark silver, sedan-style Volkswagen Jetta or Passat with tinted windows, Parker said.  At the time he was killed, Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española, New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor, who said he was “deeply saddened” to learn of the man’s death.  “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.”  Hussain, who had worked for the office for a year, studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan, the mayor’s release said, before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico.  “Our City staff has lost a member of our family,” the mayor’s statement said, “and we all have lost a brilliant public servant who wanted to serve and improve his community.” The University of New Mexico community is similarly “heartbroken” over Hussain’s death, President Garnett S. Stokes said in a statement, calling Hussain “an inspiring leader and a really special Lobo who touched so many lives.”  “It was my privilege to know and work with him,” Stokes said.  Jesse Alemán, the acting dean of graduate studies at the university, called Hussain a “brilliant, respected student leader” who “continued to extend his compassionate leadership skills and educational expertise at the local and state levels” after he graduated. Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury, who said Hussain worked on her campaign for Congress, said his “smile and his passion lit up a room.”  “His work as a field organizer for our campaign inspired countless people with his compassion and dedication to working in partnership with our communities, as one of the kindest and hardest working people I have ever known,” Stansbury said at the news conference Sunday.  Victims were ‘ambushed with no warning,’ police say The attacks have drawn condemnation from political leaders, including President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.  “While we await a full investigation, my prayers are with the victims’ families, and my Administration stands strongly with the Muslim community,” Biden wrote on Twitter.  Vice President Kamala Harris and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham similarly expressed support for New Mexico’s Muslim community, with the latter describing the attacks as “deeply angering and wholly intolerable.”  “I am incredibly angry about the situation,” the governor said Sunday. “Every New Mexican should stand up and be against this kind of hatred. It has no place in this city and it has no place in our state,” Lujan Grisham said.  Speaking to the Muslim community in Albuquerque and across the state Sunday, Congresswoman Stansbury said Muslims are “part and parcel of who we are in New Mexico.” “I want to say that every one of us in New Mexico must rise to meet these acts of hatred by demonstrating love, by demonstrating friendship and by demonstrating solidarity. This is not New Mexico. This is not who we are,” Stansbury said. “We will stand in solidarity. We will stand in grief and in mourning. And we will stand in our commitment to love and inclusion and belonging in this community.” The FBI is assisting with the investigation, according to a news release from the Albuquerque Police Department, which has created an online portal where residents can upload videos and images that may help authorities investigating the recent killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has voted to increase a reward for information that helps lead to an arrest from $15,000 to $20,000.  “These shootings are disturbing,” Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina said in a news conference Saturday, soon after the fourth victim was discovered.  Albuquerque police officers responded just before midnight Friday to reports of a shooting in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue, and found the victim dead, according to the police department’s news release. The victim, a Muslim man believed to be in his mid-20s, was from South Asia, police said. His identity has not been positively confirmed, the release added. Hussain, Hussein and Ahmadi, were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Kyle Hartsock, deputy commander of the police department’s Criminal Investigations Division, previously said. “Our top priority is keeping the community safe and we are asking the Muslim community especially, to be vigilant, to watch out for one another. If you see something, say something,” the police chief said Saturday. “Evil will not prevail.” The Muslim community is living in fear due to the killings, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said Sunday, and the city is taking steps to increase security. “We have heard from the community that the fear is so strong, there is a concern about even things like groceries and getting meals for certain folks in certain areas of town,” Keller said. The city is providing meals for those affected by the shootings, he added.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations is also offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible, the organization announced, calling the series of killings a “horrific, hateful shooting spree.”  “We thank local, state and federal law enforcement for their ongoing work on this crisis, and we call the Biden administration to ensure that authorities all of the resources needed to both protect the Albuquerque Muslim community and stop those responsible for these horrific crimes before they claim more innocent lives,” CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said in a statement.

112,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/missouri-senate-republican-primary-eric-greitens/,"Paula Callihan hasn’t quite decided whom she’s voting for in Tuesday’s crowded GOP Senate primary.   But she knows whom she’s not voting for.   “Eric Greitens scares the crap out of me,” the 67-year-old Joplin resident said last week in this southwest corner of the state. “A machine gun going through killing RINOs. I mean, that’s terrible,” she said, recalling the campaign video that depicted the former Republican governor “hunting” so-called “Republicans in Name Only.”  The candidacy of Greitens, who resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct and is now facing allegations of abuse from his ex-wife, is a big reason why a Senate race in Missouri – a deeply red state – is even part of the national conversation about Washington control in a tough national environment for Democrats.   Greitens, who has denied those allegations, started the race to succeed retiring Sen. Roy Blunt with high name recognition. Only after a super PAC started attacking him on the air this summer did Republicans worried about Greitens losing to a Democrat – or perhaps even winning himself in November – begin to breathe a small sigh of relief.  The great unknown, however, has been former President Donald Trump, who announced Monday that he was endorsing “Eric,” without specifying a last name. Greitens, who is allied with Donald Trump Jr. and his fiancée, and state Attorney General Eric Schmitt were each quick to claim that they were the intended recipient of the endorsement.  “I trust the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds,” the former President added in his statement.  In conversations with about 45 Missourians across the state last week, mostly Republicans, some said they were sticking by Greitens, and even those who weren’t expressed skepticism about the allegations. But the majority said they had issues with the candidate, ranging from “his baggage” to the fact that he was a “quitter” for resigning as governor.   Those frustrations with Greitens have cleared lanes in the GOP primary for US Rep. Vicky Hartzler and Schmitt, who have spent the final days of the race going after one another, with China a frequent flashpoint.   “It’s between us now,” Hartzler said of Schmitt, speaking to a group of voters at a wood-paneled restaurant above the Joplin Stockyards on Tuesday. “He’s a lawyer from St. Louis. I’m a farmer from rural Missouri.” Schmitt and his allies, meanwhile, have pivoted to attacking the congresswoman as he tries to run as a Washington outsider, peppering his stump speech with references to lawsuits he’s filed against the Biden administration.   But they’re only two of the 21 candidates seeking the nomination, which includes another sitting congressman and attorney Mark McCloskey, who uses the infamous image of him and his wife pointing guns at protesters outside their St. Louis home on his campaign yard signs.   With no runoff rules in Missouri, all it takes is a plurality to win. The Democrats have their own crowded field, but it’s the GOP primary that will determine just how competitive this race will be in November.  Voters’ complicated relationship with Greitens   Temperatures lingering above 100 degrees didn’t stop southwest Missouri’s GOP faithful from setting up their lawn chairs Tuesday evening in Neosho to nibble on watermelon and hear two hours’ worth of speeches from candidates up and down the ticket, although Hartzler and McCloskey were the only Senate contenders to show up.  Hartzler, a social conservative backed by the state’s junior senator, Republican Josh Hawley, said early in the race that she wouldn’t vote for Greitens if he was the nominee. “When I need to see a hairdresser, I make an appointment,” she said in one of her first ads, a not-so-subtle allusion to her opponent.   Greitens’ former hairdresser alleged that he had tied her up, coerced her into oral sex and threatened to blackmail her with partially nude photos to cover up their 2015 affair. Greitens’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story, but he told CNN in an interview in February that he did “absolutely” nothing wrong with the hairdresser.  As governor in 2018, he faced calls for impeachment from the GOP-controlled state legislature and a criminal charge – invasion of privacy – related to the affair, which he admitted to while refuting the claim of blackmail. The former Navy SEAL was separately charged with another felony – tampering with computer data – for allegedly misusing a veterans charity’s donor list for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign.   The criminal charges were later dropped. And a former FBI agent investigating the blackmail allegations was later indicted for perjury and tampering with physical evidence. A Missouri ethics panel found “no evidence of any wrongdoing” by Greitens in its investigation of campaign misconduct, although it fined his campaign for not reporting in-kind contributions. The GOP-led state House investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations ultimately led to his resignation.  “It was the thing that I had to do for the people who I love the most, particularly for my boys,” Greitens told CNN in February.   But the headlines for him got worse the following month when his former wife alleged that he had been physically abusive toward his children and her. The anti-Greitens group, Show Me Values PAC, has brought those allegations to living rooms across the state, with a recent ad featuring a female narrator reading from his ex-wife’s affidavit.    “It’s a black eye for Missouri,” 42-year-old Matt Fischer, a Schmitt supporter, said at a rally for the attorney general at Tropical Liqueurs South in Columbia on Wednesday, adding that Greitens has already made “the state look bad.”  “I would have (considered Greitens) if he hadn’t had all of his baggage,” 68-year-old Debbie Brewer said at the Ozark Distillery and Brewery in Osage Beach after attending events for both Schmitt and Hartzler on Wednesday. “We don’t need that distraction.”  Show Me Values PAC has spent more than $6 million against Greitens, according to AdImpact data through Friday.  “Somebody had to do something. Neither Hartzler or Schmitt were laying a glove on him, and he was going to win,” said a Missouri Republican strategist who’s unaffiliated in the primary.  Still, there are degrees of skepticism among some voters about the allegations against Greitens. While some chalked up the most recent ones to an ugly divorce, others suggested, without evidence, that they were “just things being thrown at him” by political opponents, as one woman at the Watermelon Feed in Neosho put it.  “He got a raw deal when he was governor,” 72-year-old Charlie Henry said as he unloaded a case of Busch beer outside the Blue Springs Walmart.   Troy Pierson, 42, of Seneca, said at the Watermelon Feed that he was leaning toward Greitens in the primary but has some reservations over the candidate’s 2018 resignation: “Him doing that makes you wonder whether or not he will stand up and fight, which is a concern, because that’s what we need.”  Disappointment with Greitens for resigning is a familiar refrain, and it’s one Schmitt has made a big part of his closing argument.  “He abused his wife and his kid – assaulted his child – and he quit on Missouri,” Schmitt said at his Columbia rally. “This man is a quitter. And when going gets tough, he got going.”  The threat of last-minute Trump involvement   While the politicians at the Watermelon Feed name-dropped Trump onstage, a life-size cardboard cutout of the former President was notably not front and center but tucked away next to the information tent, where filing out a “straw quiz” qualified you to win South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s book, a $10 Chick-fil-A gift card or .22 ammo.  Trump had previously praised Senate hopeful Billy Long, the congressman who represents much of southwest Missouri, but stopped short of an endorsement. The former President came out with a statement earlier this month saying he would not back Hartzler – a surprise to the six-term lawmaker, who boasts in her stump speech that Twitter has suspended her campaign account for her comments about keeping transgender athletes out of women’s sports.    But her lack of support from Trump didn’t seem to concern GOP voters, even those who haven’t made up their minds. “I thought, well, yeah, because they’re not the same kind of people. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t get things done,” said Trump voter Allison Lupo, 56, who praised Hartzler’s “quiet strength” as she sipped on a drink in a Schmitt koozie at his Columbia rally.  Schmitt’s opening line channels the kind of anti-establishment energy Trump cultivated in Washington. “I get up in the morning and go to work. I sue Joe Biden, I go home, and then I get up the next day and do all that over again.” It goes over well with his crowds, especially those who think Hartzler has been in DC too long, even if they like her as their congresswoman.  “I know the President is considering an endorsement. I’d love to have it,” Schmitt told reporters Wednesday in Columbia. He added that he wouldn’t support Mitch McConnell for Senate leader – an appeal to Trump and his base, who dislike the Kentucky Republican – and would instead like to see Sens. Ted Cruz or Mike Lee, both of whom have endorsed Schmitt, run.  But that’s a pledge Greitens had already made, and one that Hartzler soon made too, releasing a statement the morning after Schmitt’s comments.   Democrats vie for a chance at an uphill battle  The selfie line after Marine veteran Lucas Kunce’s 7 p.m. rally on Wednesday moved so slowly that it was dark by the time the last voters had left the outdoor amphitheater in Columbia.  The Marine veteran is running a populist campaign, on the premise that a Democrat like him can win Missouri by picking off enough voters in rural areas to narrow Republican margins.  “He seems like he’s, you know, down-home people like us,” said Linda Evans, 72, as she was coming out of the Walmart in Blue Springs.  But Kunce has strong primary competition from Trudy Busch Valentine, an heir to the beer fortune, who entered the race late and had invested more than $5 million of her own money through July 28. “Even though she comes from the Anheuser Busch family, it seems that she has a commonsense approach to what our needs are right now,” said 59-year-old Becky Wenzel of Dearborn, while sitting at the Ozark Distillery near her family’s weekend house.  Not all voters share that view.   “Busch comes from money, so she wouldn’t be a good choice,” said John Gaskey, 68, of Gladstone who was vacationing in Lake Ozark.   Valentine, who just scored the endorsement of the St. Louis mayor, pushed back on that criticism, saying in a phone interview with CNN on Thursday, “There is no vote I can buy.”  The independent candidacy of John Wood, a former senior investigator for the House January 6 committee and a self-described “conservative” and “lifelong Republican,” adds an element of uncertainty to the general election. Neither Kunce nor Valentine would admit last week that their challenge in November would be tougher if Greitens weren’t the GOP nominee.  “I don’t think it is, with the two of them in there, splitting the vote,” Kunce said, previewing a potential fall race with Schmitt and Wood. “I mean, you got their little civil war, you know, the country club Republicans versus the Trump side. It’ll be quite the adventure.”  This story has been updated Monday with Trump’s endorsement of “Eric.” ",Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Troy Pierson;Mike Lee;Eric Greitens;Vicky Hartzler;Vicky Hartzler;Vicky Hartzler;Trudy Busch Valentine;Trudy Busch Valentine;Trudy Busch Valentine;Matt Fischer;Kristi Noem;Joe Biden;Linda Evans;Paula Callihan;Charlie Henry;Eric Greiten;Eric Greiten;John Gaskey;Billy Long;Billy Long;Billy Long;Becky Wenzel;Lucas Kunce;Lucas Kunce;Lucas Kunce;John Wood;Josh Hawley;Allison Lupo;Mitch Mcconnell;Mark Mccloskey;Eric Schmitt;Eric Schmitt;Roy Blunt;Debbie Brewer,Walmart;Walmart;Twitter;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Senate Democrat Trudy Busch Valentine;Us Supreme Court;Missouri Farm Bureau;Missouri Farm Bureau;Anheuser Busch,"TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1321;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,8257;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,8632;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,8994;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,9147;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,9978;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,1692;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,7647;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1897;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2931;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,6135;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,7310;ELECTION,2447;ELECTION,6856;ELECTION,9275;ELECTION,11012;ELECTION,11199;ELECTION,11839;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,427;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3745;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6752;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,10211;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,11235;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,12548;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,427;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3745;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6752;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,10211;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,11235;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,12548;LEADER,436;LEADER,1779;LEADER,4582;LEADER,7178;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,436;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1779;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,4582;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,7178;",Osage Beach;Capitol Hill;South Dakota;Jefferson City;Blue Springs;Dearborn;Missourians;Washington;Neosho;Kentucky;Missouri;China,2525
232,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/highland-park-shooting-cooper-roberts/,"Cooper Roberts, the 8-year-old boy left paralyzed in the 4th of July parade mass shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, has been transferred to a rehabilitation facility after almost a month in pediatric intensive care, according to family spokesman Anthony Loizzi. The medical team at the rehab facility, Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, will conduct a series of assessments to determine appropriate physical and occupational therapy, as well as other rehab and mental health services, to support Cooper in regaining his strength and “reaching his maximum potential moving forward,” Loizzi said. His family said Cooper is now eating solid food and was also able to visit with his dog, George. The family also provided several photos of Cooper and George together, with the boy wearing a Minecraft shirt and a Spider-Man blanket. Cooper attended the annual parade with his parents and twin brother when he was shot by a 21-year-old man perched on the roof of a building who opened fire at paradegoers, killing seven people. The gunman used a semi-automatic rifle that he was able to purchase legally despite previous threats of violence that required police intervention. The bullet caused several significant injuries for Cooper, including a severed spinal cord, and left him paralyzed from the waist down, the family said. Days after the shooting, after regaining consciousness and being removed from a ventilator, Cooper asked to see his twin brother Luke and his dog. Luke also suffered injuries from shrapnel and was treated and released from the hospital last month. Cooper has spent the last month recovering at Comer Children’s Hospital in Chicago. Last week, his mother, Keely Roberts, released a video statement explaining her son’s injuries and plans going forward. “Cooper was shot in the back and the bullet exited his chest, which did significant damage throughout his body, including to his aorta, liver, esophagus, and spinal cord,” she said. “It is our hope that with Cooper’s continued progress and with the continued prayers and support he is receiving from everyone; he will soon be able to be transferred to Shirley Ryan Ability Lab.” Roberts herself had bullet wounds to two parts of her leg and has had multiple procedures on her foot, she said. She asked the public to keep Cooper and his twin brother in their thoughts. “Please keep following along and praying for Cooper and for Luke. They are good, sweet boys who love everyone and want good for everyone they know,” Roberts said. “They believe in the best in people and in the world. Their lives are so much more and better than this terrible thing than was done to them. Their lives are not a tragedy, they are a triumph.” CNN’s Eric Levenson, Amanda Musa, Adrienne Broaddus and Andy Rose contributed to this report.",Adrienne Broaddus;Cooper Roberts;Cooper Roberts;Cooper Roberts;Cooper Roberts;Shirley Ryan Abilitylab;Eric Levenson;Andy Rose;Amanda Musa;Anthony Loizzi;Keely Roberts,Shirley Ryan Ability Lab;Cnn;Cnn,"KILL,1052;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1820;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1926;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1011;TERROR,1073;GENERAL_HEALTH,296;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,296;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1609;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,1693;WB_1305_HEALTH_SERVICES_DELIVERY,495;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2146;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,266;MEDICAL,234;TAX_DISEASE_WOUNDS,2464;ACT_HARMTHREATEN,1174;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2319;WB_1406_DISEASES,486;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,486;WB_1430_MENTAL_HEALTH,486;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,486;SECURITY_SERVICES,1195;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1195;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1195;WB_1428_INJURY,1258;WB_1428_INJURY,1552;WB_1428_INJURY,2032;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1258;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1552;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2032;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1258;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1552;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,2032;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,826;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,977;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DOG,692;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DOG,1523;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1174;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1174;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1174;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1684;",Illinois;Highland Park;Chicago,559
599,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/climate-change-us-floods-what-matters/,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. While parts of his state have been ravaged by deluge this summer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is pretty sure most Americans don’t really care about the climate crisis. McConnell has been rightly pushing for federal disaster relief to get Kentuckians back on their feet after the freak floods. He did the same late last year when freak tornadoes swept through the state. That kind of spending is OK. But when he led Republican opposition to the massive bill Democrats hope will get the country off of carbon-emitting energy sooner, McConnell said people are concerned with other things. “The American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue,” McConnell said in a statement on Sunday following the Senate’s passage of the bill. “Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border,” he added, suggesting Democrats shouldn’t be spending on the climate crisis. A failure to tie floods to climate spending Neither of Kentucky’s Republican senators voted for the climate bill. The state’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, rarely mentions climate change and, as Inside Climate News has pointed out, he does not list climate change as a driving force behind his environmental policy. Democrats like Beshear and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin who can succeed in coal states aren’t going to advertise the climate crisis. “I wish I could tell you why we keep getting hit here in Kentucky,” Beshear said of the flooding and to the consternation of climate activists who know exactly why Kentucky keeps getting hit. “I wish I could tell you why areas where people may not have much continue to get hit and lose everything. I can’t give you the why, but I know what we do in response to it. And the answer is everything we can. These are our people. Let’s make sure we help them out.” In the wake of tragic flooding might not be the time to caterwaul about the climate crisis, but as the rate of natural disasters increases, as scientists say it will, the dots will have to be connected for more Americans. About half the country doesn’t think the climate crisis will hurt them A majority of Americans acknowledge that climate change is real and that humans contribute to it. But a lot of people in eastern Kentucky might not know they’re feeling the effects of the climate crisis. About half the country in 2021 – 47% – believed global warming would harm them personally, according to data gathered by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.  It used a statistical model to apply the results on a state-by-state basis and estimated that Kentucky residents were less likely than the American public as a whole to believe that humans are mostly to blame for climate change or that climate change would harm them personally. Even mentioning climate change can be polarizing When the climate bill was in doubt last year, CNN’s René Marsh visited parts of West Virginia that suffered disastrous flooding in 2016. ‘I’m not buying into the whole climate change thing,” Jimmy Rader, a retired Iraq war veteran in Elkview, West Virginia, told Marsh. He was still rebuilding his house years after it was taken out by the flooding. Watch that report here.  And read Marsh’s great story this week about how melting ice in Greenland could create an opportunity to mine nickel and cobalt needed to power electric vehicles. Not driving voters The climate crisis might be the existential threat driving an increase in weird weather and national disasters, but it’s not likely to drive the majority of people out to vote in November. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in June and July, only about a third of registered voters said that climate change would be extremely important to their vote for Congress this year. That includes about half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters and just 13% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters. To McConnell’s point about Americans’ concerns, the economy and inflation were the top-cited issues. A climate bill sold as an inflation bill Democrats decided to market their climate and health care bill as the Inflation Reduction Act, even though it probably will have little or no short-term effect on inflation. That doesn’t mean Democrats can’t claim to have done the world a solid by uniting to spend billions to more quickly cut down on carbon emissions. But as long as they can’t effectively tie the need for the spending to the natural disasters, it won’t do much for them politically. Climate spending will help red states too Framed as economic opportunity, the move to renewable energy is finding an audience in red states, as CNN’s Ella Nilsen wrote in April, when she looked at the booming wind industry in places such as Oklahoma.  That industry will certainly benefit from the nearly $370 billion in climate spending over 10 years that Democrats are on track to deliver when the House votes on the sweeping bill later this week. “Let’s be clear: If we tackle our emissions, the root cause of what is driving global warming and a changing climate, then we will stabilize temperatures and we will keep the worst effects of climate change from impacting our communities and our people,” said Ali Zaidi, the Biden administration’s deputy national climate adviser, who appeared on CNN on Monday to talk about the climate bill but was also asked about the Kentucky flooding.  One more click CNN’s Brandon Tensley wrote for his Race Deconstructed newsletter that climate change is hitting some communities harder than others. He talked to Deke Arndt, the chief of climate science and services at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Key lines: “The reality is that when creeks get up and out of their banks, they almost always find the folks who are already living closer to the margins, whether these are people in manufactured housing or mobile homes or people in homes that are well within the floodplain,” Arndt told CNN. “We saw it in eastern Kentucky last week. We saw it in my home region of western North Carolina last summer.” It’s an unrelenting theme, experts say: Flash floods, in particular, punch hard on already vulnerable communities. To help protect against climate-related hazards, we must think about disaster mitigation not as a short-term goal – but rather as a long-term one.",Ella Nilsen;Deke Arndt;Joe Manchin;Ali Zaidi;Jimmy

373,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/trump-missouri-endorsement/,"Former President Donald Trump’s last-minute pledge to deliver an endorsement in the Missouri GOP Senate primary set off a scramble among rival campaigns and allies of the former President, sources told CNN. The intense lobbying effort ultimately ended with Trump issuing a dual endorsement of former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens and state Attorney General Eric Schmitt. As soon as Trump’s tease hit his Truth Social platform on Monday, he was inundated with calls from Republican allies concerned that he was on the brink of backing Greitens. But one source told CNN that Trump himself had not made a final decision at the time of his post.  Sources familiar with the matter said Trump spoke with Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a longtime Greitens foe, who warned that an endorsement of the former governor would irreparably damage his relationship with top Senate Republicans. Hawley, who endorsed Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, and others have long cautioned the former President that Greitens’ baggage makes him unelectable, potentially handing Democrats a pickup opportunity in a state that strongly favors Republicans.  Trump also spoke with Florida Sen. Rick Scott, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, several times on Monday, according to two people familiar with their calls. Scott previously expressed concern about Greitens’ electability during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last December, acknowledging the “real concerns that [Greitens] might not be able to win in the general” that were circulating in GOP circles. During his conversations with Scott and others, Trump was warned that the party’s election apparatus would not support Greitens financially if he became the nominee, “so [Trump] would have to support Greitens himself,” said one source. Though Trump has amassed a war chest around $121 million between his four political action committees, he has contributed only a fraction of that fortune to midterm candidates so far this cycle. One current Trump adviser said the former President was annoyed that his $500,000 donation to a group backing Georgia GOP gubernatorial hopeful David Perdue didn’t move the needle in his primary against incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, and was hesitant about having to keep a Greitens campaign afloat in a general election contest. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel had traveled to Bedminster for a long-planned meeting with the former President Monday afternoon when she, too, was pressed for her opinion on the competitive Missouri Senate race. Trump asked McDaniel if she had any thoughts on public polling around the Missouri primary and for her general take on the race. McDaniel echoed others in warning Trump that Greitens was the only candidate who would make the race competitive for the party, according to a person familiar with their conversation, part of which occurred while Kimberly Guilfoyle was in the room. Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Trump’s eldest son, is an adviser to Greitens and has spent months pushing the former President to endorse him as the true MAGA candidate.  Longtime Trump campaign pollster John McLaughlin delivered a similar warning during a separate call with Trump, according to a person familiar, telling the former President that he didn’t think Greitens would be a good candidate at the end of the day. The last-minute lobbying marked the culmination of weeks of behind-the-scenes pressure from advisers and allies inside the former President’s orbit, sources told CNN. Advisers had relayed to Trump long before Tuesday’s primary that for his endorsement to make a difference, he would need to announce it well in advance. As primary day drew closer, many of those in Trump’s circle believed he had decided to sit out the race. The conversations around the GOP primary in Missouri began to wane until this past weekend as allies, operatives and advisers descended on Trump’s Bedminster club in New Jersey for the LIV Golf tournament. Guilfoyle was among those leading the push for the former President to endorse Greitens, who had sought Trump’s support for more than a year. The former President spoke to both Greitens and Schmitt in the hours before he made his announcement. Two sources close to Trump suggested his omission of a last name in the endorsement was done deliberately to avoid throwing his full weight behind Greitens. Afterward, both Greitens and Schmitt sought to lay claim to Trump’s endorsement.​ Greitens said he was “honored to receive” Trump’s endorsement, calling himself “the true MAGA Warrior” in the race. For his part, Schmitt said it was “truly an honor” to have Trump’s endorsement, referring to himself as “the only America First candidate in the race.” Details of the behind-the-scenes lobbying of Trump were first reported by Politico.",Brian Kemp;Kimberly Guilfoyle;Donald Trump;David Perdue;Eric Greitens;Vicky Hartzler;Josh Hawley;Hugh Hewitt;Eric Schmitt;Ronna Mcdaniel;Rick Scott;John Mclaughlin,National Republican Senatorial Committee;Senate Republicans;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Missouri Senate;Republican National Committee,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,1969;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,870;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,1120;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,2772;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,3111;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,3344;TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATE,4730;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1876;ARMEDCONFLICT,1829;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1829;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,3467;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,3539;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,3913;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRWOMAN,2354;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,800;MEDIA_MSM,1411;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,1723;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRATS,1055;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,2012;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,3009;TAX_FNCACT_POLITICO,4825;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1180;TRIAL,345;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,345;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,478;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,1207;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,2324;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1340;LEADER,21;LEADER,187;LEADER,980;LEADER,2038;LEADER,2463;LEADER,3069;LEADER,3289;LEADER,3504;LEADER,4074;LEADER,4162;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,21;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,187;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,980;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2038;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2463;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3069;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3289;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,3504;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4074;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4162;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,21;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,187;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,980;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2038;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2463;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3069;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3289;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3504;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4074;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4162;TAX_FNCACT_WARRIOR,4582;ELECTION,1649;ELECTION,2302;TAX_FNCACT_INCUMBENT,2199;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,825;",Georgia;America;Bedminster;Missouri;Florida;New Jersey,958

Chesney was performing Saturday night at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, where a woman fell to her death from an escalator railing, according to the Denver Police Department.  The country superstar released the following statement, obtained by The Denver Post: “I was devastated to learn of the loss of someone after our show. There had been so much joy, so much heart coming from the people of Denver last night — and to hear this is heartbreaking,” he said in a statement.  “Life is precious. Sharing music brings us together and that love we share makes us so much more. For the lady who came to share that love, there are no words. For her friends and family’s loss, I grieve with them and for them.”   The incident at the stadium occurred shortly before 11 p.m., at the end of Chesney’s concert, the Denver Post reported. The unidentified woman “was sitting on an escalator railing, fell to the concourse below, and died as a result of the injuries. This is being investigated as an accidental death,” Denver police said. Chesney is currently on his “Here and Now” tour, which wraps up at the end of this month. His next show is Saturday night in Minneapolis. CNN has reached out to Chesney’s representatives.

578,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/weather/sunday-weather/,"From Seattle to Oklahoma City to Boston, scorching high temperatures or torrential rainfall are on tap for much of the US. More than 70 million Americans are under heat advisories or excessive heat warnings Sunday, the National Weather Service said.  “These alerts encompass portions of the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, and Northeast including Seattle, Portland, St. Louis, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, and Boston,” CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink said. Across the Midwest and the Northeast, temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above normal – with heat index values soaring into the mid-90s to triple digits.  “The heat index across Kansas and Missouri could reach as high as 110 degrees later this afternoon,” Brink said Sunday.  In the Northeast, heat index values around New York City could climb up to 100 degrees Sunday and 103 Monday.  “The heat will hold across the Northeast through mid-week before a slow-moving cold front brings more seasonable temperatures mid to late week,” Brink said. And in the Pacific Northwest – which has suffered a brutally hot summer – temperatures are expected to peak Sunday and Monday, with highs in the 90s and triple digits, Brink said.  While swaths of the US bake, others could get inundated with flooding.  Intense rainfall threatens parts of central US More than 14 million are under flood watches Sunday, “with the most susceptible area for flooding being the Upper Mississippi Valley,” the National Weather Service tweeted.  The NWS’s Weather Prediction Center has issued a Level 3 out of 4 risk for excessive rain across parts of northeastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and northwest Illinois for Sunday. Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches has already fallen across this region over the last 24 to 36 hours, Brink said. A flood watch is in effect across parts of southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, much of southern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois. Another 3 to 5 inches of rain are possible in parts of northern Iowa and southern Wisconsin through Monday morning. “The threat for flooding will remain as yet another round of heavy rain is forecast later tonight, which could lead to a higher end flood event if the rain trains over the same areas that are getting soaked this morning,” Brink said.

358,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/business-food/titos-vodka-canned-cocktails/,"Basically everyone else is doing it, so you’d think it would be tempting for Tito’s Handmade Vodka to enter the canned cocktail craze. Instead, they’re doing the complete opposite. The vodka brand is selling a completely empty can that encourages customers to make canned cocktails however they like them, preferably with Tito’s vodka. “Tito’s in a Can” is just that…almost: It’s a 16-ounce, refillable can that costs $20 that’s meant to be a cheeky knock at the ever-growing cocktail-to-go trend. “Despite the flood of different flavors and variations, we’ve always believed the idea of customizations is always the way to go,” Taylor Berry, vice president of brand marketing for Tito’s, exclusively told CNN Business. “You can make a cocktail the way you want it and if you want the portability of a can, here’s a can we made for you — it just happens to be empty.”  The can is now on sale for a limited time at Tito’s online store with net proceeds benefiting charity.  Customers have been asking Tito’s to enter the canned cocktail space, Berry said. The brand has so far resisted, and Berry’s said that’s because Tito’s would rather focus on simply making vodka.  “We’ve been around for a quarter-century at this point, and there’s been a lot of trends that have happened throughout the alcohol industry,” he said. “We’ve stayed true to our roots — which is doing one thing, and doing one thing right.” Despite the “very tongue-in-cheek” marketing stunt (after all, it’s an empty $20 can), Berry said it’s “a vehicle to express a lot of the personality of the brand and that straightforward thinking that we have in terms of what we want to do, which is just [to make] Tito’s Handmade Vodka.” Vodka is the top-selling spirit in the United States, raking in more than $7 billion in sales last year according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US (DISCUS). Tito’s has grown in popularity since the Texas-based brand began in 1995. The family-owned company doesn’t reveal sales figures, but Tito’s is one of the country’s top-selling vodka brands.  Still, as consumers crave convenience and new flavors, ready-to-drink cocktails have exploded in popularity in recent years. Sales of premixed cocktails grew more than 40% last year, DISCUS recently revealed, soaring past $1.6 billion in sales and becoming second only to vodka in terms of volume consumption. But Tito’s has no fear of missing out on canned cocktails, Berry said. “Ultimately, from a brand standpoint, [we’re] holding true to what we know and the strategy we’ve had from the beginning — making vodka,” he said. “There’s an element of this brand not being sellouts.”",Taylor Berry,Cnn;Cnn;Spirits Council;United States,"MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1225;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,2513;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,730;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,670;LEADER,670;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,670;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,670;TAX_ECON_PRICE,436;WB_644_NUTRITION,1638;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1638;WB_1445_STUNTING,1638;WB_1444_GROWTH_MONITORING,1638;AFFECT,2524;",New York;United States,597
258,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/best-credit-cards-for-car-rental,"We’ve all experienced it before. You go to rent a car and you’re handed a laundry list of coverage options — all with a price tag attached. You want to ensure you’re covered, but you also aren’t looking forward to spending even more on your car rental. Fortunately, there’s often a different option: your credit card travel insurance. There are many credit cards that will actually provide you with car rental coverage as long as you use the card to pay for the rental. This largely unknown perk could, in fact, save you a decent amount of money on your next car rental. Additionally, some credit cards even offer special perks, such as car rental elite status and discounts. But not all credit cards offer coverage, and some offer better coverage than others. So before you rent your next car — whether it’s on vacation or just around town — make sure you have the best credit card in your pocket to ensure you’re covered. Best credit cards for car rentals in 2022 How does credit card car rental insurance work? First and foremost, when renting a car, you must pay for your rental with the specific credit card that offers car rental protection. And, if there are multiple drivers on the rental contract, the primary renter must be the card holder. Additionally, for the credit card coverage to take effect in the unfortunate case that an accident occurs, you must decline the Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) — sometimes called Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) — in your rental agreement. You might find that some car rental companies automatically include this extra insurance — and cost — into your agreement, so you’ll want to double-check your paperwork. Once you rent the car, you’ll then be covered if your rented car incurs theft or damage from a collision. This coverage will protect you from the financial responsibility of covering the cost. However, the included policy will not protect you from the cost of damage or injuries to another car if you’re found at fault. Typically, your personal car rental insurance will cover you in these situations or you can purchase separate policies from the car rental company. You’ll also notice that there are two different types of credit card car rental coverage: primary and secondary. Primary coverage means that if there’s a covered accident, the claim will go directly through the credit card company, allowing you to avoid the hassle of involving your own auto insurance policy. This will not only save you time but will also avoid any premiums to your own policy. If the credit card offers secondary car rental insurance, you’ll have to first make a claim with any other policy you have. Once the claim is settled, you can then file a claim with your credit card and you’ll be covered for anything that wasn’t initially covered with your primary policy, such as your deductible. However, one thing to note is that many credit cards that offer secondary coverage switch to primary coverage if you don’t have car insurance or if you’re renting outside the United States where your personal policy won’t cover you. You’ll also find that many coverage options are slightly different from one another. Some policies will only cover you to the maximum value of the car you’re renting, while others have higher limits. Many policies will also only cover you for a certain time period — 31 days is very common. So if you’re renting a car for a few months, you might find that your credit card coverage will not actually apply. Additionally, there are some car types that aren’t covered, such as luxury cars and pick-up trucks. You’ll also find that some countries are excluded, and while the list changes depending on the card issuer, Australia, New Zealand, Italy and Jamaica are some common countries to look out for. With that in mind, let’s take a look at our seven picks for the best cards for renting cars. Whether it’s because of the card’s insurance protections or additional benefits, some cards are better than others. Capital One Venture X Credit Card Best card for car rental insurance When it comes to car rental benefits, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a card better than the new Capital One Venture X. The card offers the whole package with elite status opportunities, increased coverage and the ability to earn a ton of rewards every time you rent. With the Capital One Venture X Card, you’ll receive primary rental insurance and up to $75,000 in coverage if you use the card to book your car. The Capital One Venture X is also one of the few cards to offer complimentary Hertz Gold Plus Rewards President’s Circle elite status. While some cards offer status or savings with Avis and National — or even a lower level with Hertz — it’s hard to beat this particular status level. With this status, you’ll be able to skip the car rental counter and head straight to your car. And, at select airport locations, when you book an intermediate car or higher, you can choose any car you desire in the President’s Circle aisle. At most other locations, you’ll receive a guaranteed car-class upgrade. Additionally, when you rent your car through the Capital One Travel Portal, you’ll earn 10 miles per dollar spent on your car rental. This effectively gives you a 10% return on your rental toward future travel — a huge earning potential every time you rent. And since you can add up to four authorized users to your Venture X Card for free, this allows four other friends or family members — who you trust with your credit card — to reap these benefits as well. The Capital One Venture X Card currently comes with a sign-up bonus of 75,000 bonus miles after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account. The card carries an annual fee of $395. Read CNN Underscored’s complete review of the Capital One Venture X. Chase Sapphire Reserve Best earn rate for renting cars The Chase Sapphire Reserve also offers primary rental insurance and up to $75,000 in coverage. The coverage truly doesn’t get better than this when it comes to credit cards, so if top-tier insurance is a key element when deciding on a credit card to use, this is a great option, along with the Capital One Venture X. Additionally, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card offers discounts and special offers with various car rental companies. For example, you’ll receive National Car Rental Emerald Club Executive status, which will allow you to choose any car in a set executive area while only paying the midsize rental rate (in the US and Canada), earn free rental days faster and add a second driver onto the rental for no additional cost. You’ll also receive special pricing and offers. You’ll also earn discounts and upgrades with Avis — thanks to the complimentary Avis Preferred status — and special car rental privileges with Silvercar. When booking a car rental directly through the Chase Ultimate Rewards travel portal, you’ll earn 10 points per dollar spent. However, if you book directly with the car rental company or a third-party booking site, you’ll still earn 3 points per dollar. Frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Chase Ultimate Rewards points at 2 cents apiece, meaning you can get up to a 20% return on your car rental. While this card comes with a hefty annual fee of $550, you can easily offset this cost with future car rental reservations. The Sapphire Reserve card comes with a $300 travel credit annually that can be used on any travel-related purchase — including car rentals. With just a few car rentals throughout the year, you’ll most likely be able to receive the full statement credit, which means the card effectively costs $250 for the year. You’ll then also receive complimentary airport lounge access, purchase protection and travel protection benefits, up to $100 in statement credits for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and much more. The Sapphire Reserve currently comes with a sign-up bonus of 80,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first three months of holding the card. Learn more and apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve Chase Sapphire Preferred Best low-annual-fee card for renting cars The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card will also give you access to primary car rental insurance — while also allowing you to earn travel rewards — but at a significantly lower annual fee than the previously mentioned Sapphire Reserve. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is just $95 per year, which is a bargain compared to some of the other options on this list. The main difference when it comes to coverage is the reimbursement amount. With the lower-annual-fee Sapphire Preferred, you’ll be reimbursed up to the actual cash value of the vehicle, which should be more than substantial for most accidents, but not as high as the $75,000 coverage you’ll receive with the Chase Sapphire Reserve. While the card doesn’t provide any car rental elite status benefits, you’ll receive a complimentary 12-month DoorDash subscription (must activate by Dec. 31, 2024) and $50 in statement credits each account anniversary year for hotel stays purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards. The Chase Sapphire Preferred also earns 5 points per dollar spent on travel, which includes car rentals, when purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards. You’ll earn 2 points per dollar on all other travel purchases — so you’ll still be earning a solid amount of points every time you rent a car. The Chase Sapphire Preferred currently comes with a sign-up bonus of 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first three months of holding the card. Learn more and apply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Chase Freedom Unlimited Best no-annual-fee card for renting cars With many credit cards costing up to hundreds of dollars in annual fees, it’s nice to know that you can still receive car rental perks with a card that charges no annual fee. With the Chase Freedom Unlimited card, you’ll still receive primary car rental insurance for car rentals outside of the United States. The only caveat to using this card internationally is that you’re charged a foreign transaction fee. You’ll have to weigh the pros and cons on the fee charged with the savings you’re receiving by declining the car rental company’s own insurance options. For car rentals within the United States, you’ll only receive secondary insurance. This means coverage only kicks in after you have already exhausted any other insurance options you have, such as your own personal insurance. The Chase Freedom Unlimited comes with a sign-up bonus of an additional 1.5% cash back on all categories on up to $20,000 spent in the first year. Learn more and apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited The Platinum Card from American Express Best for car rental elite status With a single card, you’ll receive complimentary benefits with three different car rental companies: National, Avis and Hertz, though enrollment is required. With National, you’ll receive National Emerald Club Executive status. For select locations in the US and Canada, you can simply pay for a midsize car rental, but when you show up to rent the car, you’re able to choose from any full-size (or above) car in the Executive area. You’ll also receive free rental days faster, waived second driver fees and member-only promotions and discounts. With Avis, you’ll receive Avis Preferred Plus status. This allows you to save time by bypassing the car rental counter in most locations and going straight to your reserved car. You’ll also receive complimentary upgrades, bonus points for every paid rental and exclusive discounts. The Hertz benefit doesn’t offer an elite tier level, but you’ll still receive a special corporate discount code, which could potentially save you money on your next rental Unfortunately, this is the only card on the list that doesn’t extend primary car rental status automatically. Instead, the card offers secondary insurance, which means you must go through any other insurance provider you have first. (For residents of Utah and Vermont only, the insurance is primary.) However, if you want to use your Amex Platinum card to pay for your next car rental and prefer primary coverage, you can purchase “Premium Car Rental Protection.” You’ll pay a flat rate for your entire rental — up to 42 consecutive days of coverage (however, if you live in Washington, you are only covered for up to 30 consecutive days). Coverage is available worldwide — except for vehicles rented in Australia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica and New Zealand — and there are two different coverage options to select from. The current welcome bonus offer on the Amex Platinum is 80,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $6,000 in the first six months of holding the card. The card comes with an annual fee of $695, but it features a long list of alluring benefits (see rates and fees).

You’ll also receive a 30% discount on Silvercar rentals with no restrictions. But there’s one big advantage of this card over the Amex Platinum — you’ll receive primary car rental insurance. The card carries a high $400 annual fee, but that can easily be offset with numerous perks. Right away, you’ll receive up to $325 in annual credits, which can be used toward eligible travel purchases and dining. Since receiving the reimbursement is extremely easy, this effectively brings your annual fee down to a much more palatable $75 per year. Additionally, the card offers up to $100 in statement credits toward Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fees every four years; a 12-month Priority Pass Select membership, which allows you to visit an airport lounge (or participating restaurants) four times; no foreign transaction fees; and more. Learn more and apply for the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve. Ink Business Cash Credit Card Best card for renting cars for small businesses If you’re looking for a credit card to cover you while traveling for business, the Ink Business Cash Credit Card is the perfect pick. For a card that charges no annual fee, the Ink Business Cash offers an impressive benefit where you’ll receive primary rental car coverage when renting for business purposes. Best of all, the card also extends primary coverage for international rentals, even when renting for personal reasons. This is one of the few no-annual-fee business cards that will truly cover you when renting a car, so if you’re a small-business owner, this is an ideal card to have in your wallet.

282,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/west-virginia-abortion-bill-special-session/,"The West Virginia House on Wednesday passed a bill that would ban abortions with some exceptions, significantly curtailing access to the procedure in a state where it is currently legal up to 20 weeks post-fertilization.  The bill passed the state House in a 69-23 vote and now moves to the state Senate for consideration.   HB 302 would prohibit abortion at any stage of pregnancy with exceptions for a nonmedically viable fetus, a medical emergency or an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus and cannot survive. The bill, as introduced, did not provide exceptions for abortions in cases of rape and incest.   Under the bill, an abortion provider who violates the law would be subject to a felony and could face between three to 10 years imprisonment. The GOP-majority House on Wednesday approved an amendment from Republican Del. John Hardy to include exceptions for rape and incest up until about 14 weeks of gestation and if a report was made to a “qualified law enforcement officer.” Democrats’ attempts to amend the bill failed, including an amendment that would have stripped the bill of its criminal penalties for abortion providers and another amendment that would have added exceptions for rape or incest without a gestational period limit. The chamber’s approval followed a public hearing earlier in the day in which lawmakers heard from about 90 people, including several women who shared personal stories of sexual assault or their own abortions. West Virginia is the latest Republican-led state to reconvene in an attempt to curtail abortion rights after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month. The opinion, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, reversed nearly 50 years of precedent and established that, going forward, abortion rights would be determined by the states unless Congress acts.  Last week, Republican Gov. Jim Justice called lawmakers back for a special session and, at the last minute, added abortion to the legislative agenda. In a proclamation, he asked the legislature to “clarify and modernize the abortion-related laws currently existing as part of the West Virginia Code, to ensure a coherent, comprehensive framework governing abortions and attendant family services and support to expecting mothers to provide the citizens of this State more certainty in the application of such laws.”  After the high court struck down the landmark 1973 Roe decision, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, argued in a memo that an 1849 state law criminalizing abortion was enforceable. Abortion providers filed a lawsuit shortly after, claiming it violated the state constitution, and a state court judge earlier this month blocked the 19th Century abortion ban from going into effect.   Morrisey filed an appeal to the state Supreme Court and a motion for the court to expedite the case.   In more than a dozen states, legal fights are underway over abortion bans and other laws that greatly limit the procedure. And on Monday, Indiana lawmakers reconvened for a special session to consider more restrictions on abortion.

376,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/weather/heat-midwest-northeast-kentucky/,"Two rounds of excessive heat will grip a large part of the country this week, impacting people from the Plains to the Midwest and the Northeast. Heat advisories are in place for more than 30 million people from Oklahoma and Arkansas to Minnesota. “Daytime highs will likely reach into the upper 90s to low 100s, and heat indices perhaps reaching 110 degrees when combined with high dewpoints,” the Weather Prediction Center said in its morning discussion Tuesday. This heat will spread eastward, impacting the Northeast by the end of the week, then another round of heat will hit the Plains once again. Between the waves of above-average heat, a bit of relief will come as cooler air pushes through. Here is when to expect the heat and the minor relief. Sweltering in the South, Plains and Midwest   “Dangerous heat indices expected today across much of central and southern (Minnesota) with afternoon heat index values expected to top out around 105 degrees,” warned the National Weather Service office in the Twin Cities in Minnesota.  Heat index values – the temperature it feels like when heat is combined with humidity – are for shady locations, the weather service explained. “If you are exposed to direct sunlight, the heat index value can be increased by up to 15 (degrees).” The weather service breaks down the heat index temperatures into four different risk levels based on how heat index temperatures could affect the body. Danger, the third of four categories, is for forecast heat indices reaching 103 to 124 degrees. At this level, heat cramps or heat exhaustion is likely, and heatstroke is possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity. The maps below show the forecast dangers (dark orange) this week. The heat will be felt much farther and wider than in Minnesota.  An area of high pressure sitting over the Great Lakes is creating bright sunshine. But it’s also resulting in warm, moist air from the south to spill into the region. Plainly put: High pressure is making it hot. It is generating above-normal temperatures for such a large area in the midsection of the country. “Today looks to be the hottest day of the week,” said the weather service office in Wichita, Kansas. Here, temperatures will also top out around 100 degrees. But once you factor in the humidity, it will feel closer to 105 degrees in some areas. In southern Nebraska, it will feel even hotter.  “Heat index values are now forecast to climb as high as 110 degrees in eastern portions of the area,” said the weather service office in Hastings. There may be one saving grace – a nice breeze. “The good news is that south winds of 10-15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph will help combat the oppressive heat,” the weather service said. The heat will even affect Kentucky, where the horrific flooding happened less than a week ago.  High temperatures are expected to climb into the lower 90s Wednesday and Thursday, proving challenging for those still living without power from the floods. The heat will march on to the Northeast by the end of the week, giving the region a small window to cool down. A dangerous heat for the mid-Atlantic and Northeast   For Washington, DC, and New York, the extreme heat will peak on Thursday and Friday. The weather service office in Washington mentioned in its morning discussion the forecast models favor “highs in the mid-90s which carries heat indices into the 100 to 104 degree range.” New York City could even feel like 100 on Thursday and Friday, not able to escape the sweltering heat. Its weather service office warned a heat advisory could be issued for those days. By Saturday, a cold front will swing through the Northeast, bringing the potential for heavy rainfall and a temporary improvement in temperatures.   A second round of heat returns to the Plains  After a brief reprieve, another round of heat will quickly hit the same areas as the first, sending high temperatures soaring once again. “Friday looks to be the next chance of widespread 90s across central/southern Minnesota,” said the weather service office in the Twin Cities. While this round may not last quite as long as the first, the heat will be just as potent. “The center of the upper ridge looks to be situated over Kansas during the weekend ensuring the return of triple-digit heat to many areas,” the weather service said.  By Saturday, another cold front will move through the area, helping to drop temperatures out of the triple-digit range and return them to more seasonal norms. Saturday’s highs – back in the low 80s for Minneapolis – sound almost refreshing compared to heat indices in the triple digits. While the Midwest starts to cool off, the second wave of heat will push into the Northeast by the beginning of next week. “This wave looks to reach the Northeast by Sunday with another brief wave of high temperatures expected to continue ahead of a cold front into Monday,” the Weather Prediction Center said Tuesday.",,Weather Prediction Center;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2693;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2693;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_WICHITA,2068;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,3674;AFFECT,1273;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,2092;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KANSAS,4181;MANMADE_DISASTER_WITHOUT_POWER,2879;POWER_OUTAGE,2879;ARMEDCONFLICT,2578;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2895;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,27;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,149;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,308;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,463;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,562;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,656;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,743;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,881;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,942;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1077;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1169;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1241;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1341;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1401;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1415;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1586;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2297;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2598;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2637;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2907;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3030;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3146;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3343;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3487;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3535;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3747;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3793;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,4095;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,4240;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,4566;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,4662;TAX_DISEASE_HEAT_EXHAUSTION,1426;",Arkansas;Minnesota;Kansas;Oklahoma;Nebraska;Wichita;Washington;New York;Kentucky,1006
384,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/economy/june-consumer-credit-report-debt-increase/,"Americans piled on $40.1 billion worth of debt in June, the Federal Reserve said Friday afternoon. The figure was considerably higher than economists’ forecasts, after May’s revised total of $23.8 billion. Americans’ borrowing grew by 10.5% in June, compared to 6.3% in May, according to the Fed’s G.19 consumer credit report. Revolving debt — roughly a proxy for outstanding credit card balances — rose by 16% after an 7.8% increase in May. Non-revolving debt, which includes loans like car loans and student loans, grew by 8.8% after a 5.8% increase in May. These figures exclude mortgage balances, which represent most of the debt carried by households. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Americans borrowed an additional $98.9 billion, the Fed said. Friday’s report comes on the heels of a separate release from the New York Fed that reported Americans’ non-housing-related debt ballooned by $103 billion in the second quarter, the largest increase since 2016.   The jump comes as inflation remains at a four-decade high. Last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation soared to an annualized 9.1% in June, with increases on food, gas and a broad-based rise in nearly all categories triggered by a combination of sky-high energy costs and supply issues.",,Bureau Of Labor Statistics;Cnn;Federal Reserve,"UNGP_EDUCATION,684;WB_350_FINANCIAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_REMITTANCES,326;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,326;WB_357_CREDIT_REPORTING,326;EPU_POLICY_FEDERAL_RESERVE,81;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,81;WB_336_NON_BANK_FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS,758;WB_612_HOUSING_FINANCE,758;WB_332_CAPITAL_MARKETS,758;GENERAL_HEALTH,527;GENERAL_HEALTH,605;MEDICAL,527;MEDICAL,605;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,527;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,605;ECON_INFLATION,467;ECON_INFLATION,545;ECON_INFLATION,1154;ECON_INFLATION,1250;WB_442_INFLATION,467;WB_442_INFLATION,545;WB_442_INFLATION,1154;WB_442_INFLATION,1250;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,14;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,492;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,570;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,867;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1408;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,678;ECON_DEBT,51;ECON_DEBT,342;ECON_DEBT,630;ECON_DEBT,802;ECON_DEBT,1043;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,51;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,342;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,630;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,802;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1043;WB_450_DEBT,51;WB_450_DEBT,342;WB_450_DEBT,630;WB_450_DEBT,802;WB_450_DEBT,1043;TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMIST,154;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,219;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,1020;",American;New York;Americans,288

656,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/investing/meme-stocks-bed-bath-beyond-gamestop-amc/,"Meme mania has returned to the stock market with a vengeance. Shares of movie theater chain AMC\n            \n                (AMC), video game retailer GameStop\n            \n                (GME) and struggling home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond\n            \n                (BBBY) soared Monday, extending last week’s big gains.  AMC was up 16% and has now spiked 70% in just the past five trading days while Bed Bath & Beyond shot up 40% Monday and has more than doubled in the past week. GameStop rose 12% Monday and has gained 30% in the last five days.  What’s going on? All three consumer stocks have rabid followings among individual investors on Reddit and other social media sites. These investors are hoping to punish professional hedge funds and big institutional firms who have bet against these stocks by short-selling them. Short sellers profit when a stock goes down.  This army of traders has galvanized on Reddit to support these so-called meme stocks —even though there are serious questions about the companies’ fundamentals. All three firms are expected to lose money this year and next.  Streaming media services and gaming downloads pose challenges for AMC and GameStop. Bed Bath & Beyond just ousted its CEO following less than three years on the job after the company reported lousy results in June. But none of that matters to the “apes” on Reddit, a nickname that many meme stock fans have adopted for themselves. GameStop and AMC also seem to relish their underdog status. GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen, who also founded online pet retailer Chewy\n            \n                (CHWY), tweeted after GameStop announced a new NFT marketplace in July that the “left for dead retailer just launched something new.” The tweet ended with the flushed face emoji. 😳 Cohen’s RC Ventures firm is the top investor in GameStop and also has recently bought a big stake in Bed Bath & Beyond.  AMC is taking its appreciation for the apes one step further. The company announced earlier this month that it plans to reward shareholders with a special dividend to be paid in the form of an AMC Preferred Equity unit, a new class of stock that AMC has applied to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “APE.” AMC CEO Adam Aron said in a press release that the company is “rewarding and recognizing our passionate and supportive shareholder base.” AMC also intends to issue an  “I OWN APE” NFT exclusively to those investors. Even as short sellers continue to circle these meme stocks, the apes may have the upper hand for now.  AMC shares are down 5% this year. That’s not as bad as the broader market and is a relatively small loss considering the stock soared nearly 1,200% in 2021. GameStop is up more than 20% in 2022, following a nearly 700% pop last year. Bed Bath & Beyond is still down more than 20% on the year, though, despite the recent surge.",Adam Aron;Ryan Cohen,York Stock Exchange;Bed Bath Beyond;Bed Bath Beyond;Bed Bath Beyond;Bed Bath Beyond;Bed Bath Beyond;New York Stock Exchange;Gamestop;Gamestop;Gamestop;Gamestop;Gamestop;Gamestop;Gamestop;Gamestop,"ECON_STOCKMARKET,58;ECON_STOCKMARKET,766;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1295;ECON_STOCKMARKET,2139;ECON_STOCKMARKET,2190;ECON_STOCKMARKET,2679;",New York Stock Exchange;New York,622
655,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mark-milley-resignation-letter-lafayette-square/,"In the wake of then-President Donald Trump’s infamous photo-op at the height of the George Floyd protests, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley penned a lengthy and vociferous critique of Trump in a resignation letter he ultimately never sent, The New Yorker reported on Monday. On June 1, 2020, Milley accompanied Trump on a walk from the White House to St. John’s Church, where he was photographed wearing his combat uniform and moving with the President’s entourage through Lafayette Square. Protesters had been forcibly cleared out of the area minutes before. The images provoked a swift wave of criticism from lawmakers and several senior former military officials who said they risked dragging the traditionally apolitical military into a contentious domestic political situation. Milley’s letter was dated June 8, a week after the incident, according to The New Yorker. The article was based on “The Divider: Trump in the White House 2017-2021,” a forthcoming book by Peter Baker and Susan Glasser. “The events of the last couple weeks have caused me to do deep soul-searching, and I can no longer faithfully support and execute your orders as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” Milley wrote, according to The New Yorker. “It is my belief that you were doing great and irreparable harm to my country. I believe that you have made a concerted effort over time to politicize the United States military.” The report said Milley sought advice regarding the resignation letter, including from former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Joseph Dunford, retired Army Gen. James Dubik, an expert on military ethics, as well as members of Congress and former officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. Milley ultimately decided not to quit. “F*** that s***,” Milley told his staff, according to The New Yorker. “I’ll just fight him.” “If they want to court-martial me, or put me in prison, have at it,” Milley added. “But I will fight from the inside.” A spokesman for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs declined to comment to CNN about the report.  Milley would later publicly apologize for his involvement in the incident in a pre-recorded speech at the National Defense University. “I should not have been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics. As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it,” Milley said during the address.",Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Joseph Dunford;Mark Milley;Mark Milley;Mark Milley;James Dubik;Peter Baker;John Church;John Church;John Church;Susan Glasser;George Floyd;Mark Esper;Mark Esper;William Barr;William Barr,National Defense University;White House;White House;White House;White House;Army Gen;John Church;John Church;John Church;Cnn;Cnn;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,793;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2220;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,2220;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,2220;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,2220;WB_2089_ETHICS_AND_CODES_OF_CONDUCT,2220;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,644;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,644;RESIGNATION,228;RESIGNATION,2078;PROTEST,523;SOC_EXPRESSREGRET,2688;ARMEDCONFLICT,425;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2253;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESS,2253;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS,137;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS,1182;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS,1708;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS,2003;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS,2138;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS,2603;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,2566;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,2492;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,2492;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2492;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2492;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2492;MILITARY,2172;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,117;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1162;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1688;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1983;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,2118;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,2583;TRIAL,1603;TRIAL,1898;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1603;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1898;EDUCATION,2783;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2783;LEADER,461;LEADER,1455;LEADER,1750;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,461;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1455;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1750;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,461;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1455;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1750;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS_OF_STAFF,146;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS_OF_STAFF,1191;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS_OF_STAFF,1717;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEFS_OF_STAFF,2012;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,378;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,1525;TAX_RELIGION_CHURCH,1820;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2880;AFFECT,2422;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,2984;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,2984;ACT_MAKESTATEMENT,2623;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,359;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,952;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1492;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1787;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,687;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2272;KILL,1138;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1636;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1931;",White House;National Defense University;United States;Washington;Lafayette Square;New Yorker,522
472,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/drought-water-canal-colorado-nebraska-climate/,"Residents on this state line have built their industry, economy and lives around the South Platte River. But as an intense and widespread drought digs into the High Plains, flows have decreased.  Unwilling to leave things to chance, Nebraska has taken action by invoking the fine print of a century-old water compact between the two states — and sparking new tension in the process.   Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts in April signed legislation that, within the terms of the compact, would allow Nebraska to build a canal in Colorado to siphon water off the South Platte River. In response, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis described the plan as a “costly and misguided political stunt.”  But it’s a conflict climatologists say could play out more often as drought expands in the West and Central US, draining water supplies and exacerbating strains between urban growth and agriculture. “We go through droughts every 20 years or so, but nothing of this magnitude,” said Tom Cech, former co-director of the One World One Water Center at Metropolitan State University in Denver. “We are in for a wave of water rights battles through the West. This is the driest it has been in 1,200 years.”  Who has the right? The South Platte River runs from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, through Denver, and courses northeast alongside I-76 toward Nebraska. Along the way, the city gives way to miles of farms and ranches on both sides of the Colorado-Nebraska border.  But much of that land is now brown. Concerns about how much water – or how little – is flowing down the South Platte led Ricketts to announce the $500 million plan to build a canal on Colorado land to funnel water into a Nebraska reservoir system during the non-irrigation months in the fall and winter.   “Without this compact and our ability to enforce our rights, we will see the dramatic impact upon our state,” Ricketts said in an April press conference, pointing to Colorado’s ever-growing population and its estimate of nearly $10 billion for 282 new projects along the South Platte. “Should all the long-term goals be affected, they would reduce the amount of water flows coming to the state of Nebraska by 90%.”  That rationale raised eyebrows in Colorado. “The fact is, many of those projects are not necessarily going to come to fruition,” Kevin Rein, Colorado’s state engineer and director of the Colorado Division of Water Resources, told CNN, noting that the state curtails usage based on water-rights seniority to ensure that Nebraska still gets the water it has the right to.   “In the 99-year history of the compact, we have complied with those provisions of the compact,” Rein said. “They are getting what they agreed to.”  Despite the population growth in Denver, Rein said, the amount of water used has decreased because of conservation efforts. However, the state acknowledges future expansion could impact supplies.  “Development along the South Platte River could begin to diminish flows as they travel down the river toward the lower section of the river and ultimately Nebraska,” Rein said.  At the same time, building a canal would have an impact on Colorado water rights, Rein said. But overall, he believes the compact is good for Colorado.  “It’s really two states getting along,” he explained. “What we have is good for farmers in Colorado and good for farmers in Nebraska in that region that are part of a community and work together. And they’re the ones that could be impacted.”   The South Platte River Compact allows Nebraska 500 cubic feet of water per second — with some conditions — in the fall and winter between October 15 and April 1.  However, during the irrigation season in the spring and summer, from April 1 and October 15, Nebraska’s allotment drops to 120 cubic feet per second.    Critically, though, the compact permits Nebraska to build a canal on Colorado land to divert water from the South Platte “for irrigation of lands in Nebraska” and “grants Nebraska and its citizens the right to acquire by purchase, prescription, or the exercise of eminent domain” any land necessary to build and maintain the canal.  Nebraska’s legislature so far has approved $53.5 million for the Perkins County Canal Project Fund for “design, engineering, permitting and options to purchase land.” The state said it has also hired an independent consulting firm to do a cost and timeline analysis. The study is expected to be presented to Nebraska’s legislature before the end of the year.  Caught in the middle of this political tug-of-war are the farmers, ranchers and their communities built around the South Platte in eastern Colorado and western Nebraska — many of whom were surprised to hear of Nebraska’s plans for the canal.  ‘Nobody wants to lose any of their property’   History can be found all around Julesburg, Colorado. There’s the Pony Express Trail and Fort Sedgwick, which was immortalized in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves.”   For Jay Goddard, a banker and fifth-generation rancher in this corner of Colorado, history literally stretches across his land.  Goddard’s ranch bears a two-and-a-half-mile scar from when Nebraska began — but never finished — digging a Perkins County canal more than a century ago.  “Well, obviously, nobody wants to lose any of their property,” Goddard told CNN while walking along the remainder of the ditch, with the interstate highway and Nebraska visible in the distance. The ground on his ranch is dry and brittle. “There’s usually water standing in some of these lagoons and they’re completely dry right now.”    He’s also concerned about the impacts of the canal on the overall health of the river.  “I hope it doesn’t knock down the flow during the wintertime. We have a lot of hunters that come to this area. We have a lot of good wildlife — whether geese, turkey, deer and ducks — that come through on a migration and so I’m worried that it will dry up the river at the wrong time,” Goddard said.   Not only would that hurt Julesburg’s tourism and economy, but it would also impact its neighbors’ businesses as well. Goddard explained that the border is porous, with many — like him — having operations in both states.  “I want to make sure that my [agriculture] producers and the folks that bank on our [agriculture] lending side are taken care of well on both sides of the line,” Goddard said.  Just on the other side in Nebraska, farmer Darrel Armstrong sees the issue as less about Nebraska versus Colorado and more a battle of “agriculture against urban.”  “We feel that in a lot of the agreements that have been made that [rural areas are] coming up short,” Armstrong said to CNN. “The people who are upholding the agreements had nothing to do with making the agreements.”  According to Cech, the population expansion in the High Plains was enabled by the agriculture industry.    “If you don’t have irrigation in Colorado – in the West – all you’re going to grow is probably prickly pear cactus and sagebrush,” Cech said. “Water is key to that economic growth, not only in Colorado or Western Nebraska, but in California and the West in general.”  As the drought lingers, which Armstrong called, “very devastating,” the tougher the conditions for his business. “We are looking at potentially zero production on our dry land crops without water,” he said.   He agrees with Goddard that the South Platte needs to be protected.  “The South Platte basically is the lifeblood to our surface aquifer and so we need to somehow keep the South Platte running,” Armstrong said. “We’re seeing less and less come down the river from what we had in the past.”  Lawsuits could delay Nebraska from moving forward with its canal project. But for now, on these farms and ranches, there are more questions than answers.  “What can they do for me to make sure that it’s not disrupting my production, but also my other producers in this area?” rancher Goddard wondered.  It’s just beginning of a new era of water wars in an age of unprecedented climate change as rivers dry up and desperation flows. “Human nature is our biggest barrier, I believe, in trying to manage water in the West,” Cech said.

347,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/asia/npw-analysis-biden-al-qaeda-intl/,"It manages to both shock and seem entirely, chillingly, predictable. The killings of key terrorist leaders have become increasingly commonplace, as the attacks they used to plot or inspire dwindle in their impact on the West, and the West’s counter-terrorism capability grows.  But taking out the head of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, on a balcony in one of the fanciest neighborhoods in Kabul – a city from which the US withdrew in chaos a year ago – is no everyday feat. It is a shocking display of what twenty years’ experience hunting terrorists has left the US capable of. Yet it leaves a predictable lesson in its wake: Afghanistan has remained a safe haven for terrorists over the past decade – they just didn’t carry out attacks from there that meant we paid attention. But the fact that Zawahiri lived there in plain sight debunks the febrile spinning that went on in the lead-up to the US withdrawal.  For years, the US’s perception of the al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan appeared to vacillate depending on what footprint the US was pursuing; in years when they wanted to push harder during their longest war, I recall being briefed that a solid hardcore threat – perhaps a few hundred key al Qaeda figures – remained and could reconstitute itself.  Then, as the US rushed for the exits, the danger posed by al Qaeda was played down. Afghan raids against al Qaeda leaders showed how well the problem was being handled, the US seemed to imply, rather than that the group was still there and big enough to hit. Now – ironically because of this American success – there is undeniable evidence of the problem Washington has wished away for years.  Al Qaeda are “cooking something up,” said one former Afghan government official with an intimate grasp of counter-terrorism. He suggested that Zawahiri was not the only major al Qaeda figure in the country, and that his potential successor, the number two Saif al-Adel – reported by the UN to be in Iran – may have entered Afghanistan recently. In May last year, shortly before the startling fall of Kabul, it was estimated by Afghan intelligence officials that it would take al Qaeda between six and 12 months to carry out attacks in the region, and perhaps 18 months to do the same in the West.  It’s unclear how that timeline has been affected by Zawahiri’s death, but we can be sure its symbolic impact means it is unlikely to have sped it up. So where does this leave the Taliban? In truth, not much has changed.  The Haqqani network, which has a tight hold on Kabul, has long been accused of strong links to al Qaeda. It may well be their infrastructure which hid and supported Zawahiri during his time in the city.   His death may therefore accentuate any splits within the Taliban; the group’s moderates may wish its efforts to acclimatize to the world stage had not been hampered by this incident. But don’t count too hard on that.  The Haqqanis remain perhaps the most confident and assertive wing of the group, and it is unlikely they’ll suddenly change tack after this embarrassment.  For the ordinary people of Afghanistan, grappling with the impact of sanctions, isolation and the struggle an insurgency was always going to face when it suddenly had to provide government services, it is yet more bad news.  It is harder to make a case for improving the West’s relationship with Kabul after this. And it is not as if this strike enormously alters the reality that al Qaeda face on the ground: Their brand has spun into a series of global franchises that inflict local terror – usually by locals on locals. Yet they remain a group that has not brutalized its way into world headlines for some time.  Zawahiri seems, according to one senior counter-terrorism analyst, to have become more relaxed and confident in his messages to the outside world, referring to more recent world events; complacency, either on his part or on the part of his hosts, may have led to this successful strike.  Zawahiri is still believed to have been directly involved in planning al Qaeda operations, but the world has changed since the abrupt shock and seismic grief of September 11, 2001. His death is unlikely to halt any attacks that are already in the planning. It does, though, teach us two lessons: Firstly, that despite its humiliating but strategically inevitable withdrawal from Afghanistan, the US retains a long reach and a long memory. It is still pursuing justice for a twenty-year-old crime. There is a resolve here, and given the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine, that cannot go unnoticed by the US’s adversaries.  But the second lesson is darker: That people don’t always change. That, even after the ravages of the NATO presence in Afghanistan, and the damage and chaos brought to that country by the Taliban’s decision to allow al Qaeda to shelter there decades ago, some part of the Taliban chose to give them a home there again. The scene still baffles me: that in an area where for twenty years Westerners and connected Afghan officials would bask in comfort behind secure walls, a US drone strike killed the leader of al-Qaeda – who thought he could relax on a balcony in the dawn light.

681,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/media/mike-tyson-hulu-series/,"Mike Tyson is not happy about Hulu’s new scripted limited series about his life. The former heavyweight champion on Saturday voiced his displeasure over Hulu’s new series “Mike,” which debuts on August 25 and stars Trevante Rhodes, from 2016’s “Moonlight,” as the famed boxer. “Don’t let Hulu fool you. I don’t support their story about my life,” Tyson’s wrote in an Instagram post. “They stole my life story and didn’t pay me.” He added, “To Hulu executives I’m just a n****r they can sell on the auction block.” In a previous post on Instagram Saturday, Tyson alleged that Hulu tried to pay UFC president Dana White to promote the series, but that he refused. “Hulu tried to desperately pay my brother @danawhite millions without offering me a dollar to promote their slave master take over story about my life,” he said on Instagram. “He turned it down because he honors friendship and treating people with dignity. I’ll never forget what he did for me just like I’ll never forget what Hulu stole from me.” Hulu had no comment regarding Tyson’s reaction. “Mike” is an eight-episode limited series, which “explores the tumultuous ups and downs of Tyson’s boxing career and personal life — from being a beloved global athlete to a pariah and back again,” according to Hulu. Dramatizations have rankled their subjects before, so Tyson’s complaints — while stern — are not new. For example, many of the former Los Angeles Lakers earlier this year were not happy with their portrayals in HBO’s drama series “Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.” Executive and former Laker, Jerry West, went as far as to demand a retraction. (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) Yet Tyson doesn’t really have much a recourse in terms of “Mike” since scripted series of famous people’s lives are often produced without their permission or input. The company’s description notes that the series is “an unauthorized and no-holds-barred look at the life of Mike Tyson,” adding that it’s “one wild ride.” ",Mike Tyson;Mike Tyson;Trevante Rhodes;Dana White;Jerry West,Instagram;Instagram;Instagram;Warner Bros;Los Angeles Lakers;Cnn;Cnn,"ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLAR,752;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,1559;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;TAX_FNCACT_ATHLETE,1215;TAX_FNCACT_BOXER,275;WB_2670_JOBS,1155;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1155;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,1155;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,1155;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,1155;TAX_FNCACT_SLAVE,775;SOC_SLAVERY,775;TAX_FNCACT_FOOL,297;LEADER,596;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,596;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,596;AFFECT,916;AFFECT,962;TAX_FNCACT_CHAMPION,134;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVES,451;",New York,441

587,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/senate-democrats-health-care-climate-bill-vote/,"The Senate has worked through the night and into Sunday morning, taking a series of back-to-back amendment votes that are among the last steps toward final passage of Democrats’ sweeping health care and climate bill – putting the package on track to be approved by the chamber as soon as this weekend. The process is known on Capitol Hill as a “vote-a-rama,” and started Saturday night shortly after 11:30 p.m. ET, and which is expected to stretch well into Sunday. A vote on final passage of the bill will take place when amendment votes end, the timing of which it is not yet clear. The bill – named the Inflation Reduction Act – would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would impose new taxes to pay for it. The package is the product of painstaking negotiations and will give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. Senate Democrats are using a special process to pass the package without Republican votes.  Once the legislation has passed in the Senate, it would next need to be approved by the House of Representatives before President Joe Biden could sign it into law.  What happens next  Following the procedural vote to proceed to the bill, the Senate entered debate before moving into the “vote-a-rama.” The marathon series of amendment votes with no time limit must run its course before a final vote can take place.  Republicans are using the “vote-a-rama” to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes, and votes on contentious policy issues are expected.  As expected, key insulin provisions were struck out of the bill after Republicans raised a point of order, resulting in a vote to strip them out. The final vote was 57-43. A 60-vote threshold was needed to keep the provision in place.  The provisions initially included in the bill would have limited insulin prices to $35 per month in both the private insurance market as well as through Medicare. But the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the cap on insulin in the private insurance market was not compliant with the reconciliation rules Democrats are utilizing to push their legislation through the chamber.  Democrats kept both provisions in the bill anyway, but Republicans raised a point of order to force a vote to strike the provisions only from the private marketplace. The Medicare $35 insulin cap remains in place. The House is poised to come back to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer’s office.  How Democrats plan to pass the sweeping legislation  Senate Democrats only need a simple majority for final passage of the bill since they are using a process known as reconciliation, which allows them to avoid a Republican filibuster and corresponding 60-vote threshold.  In order to pass a bill through the reconciliation process, however, the package must comply with a strict set of budget rules.  The Senate parliamentarian has to decide whether the provisions in the bill meet the rules to allow Democrats to use the filibuster-proof budget process to pass the legislation along straight party lines.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that after undergoing the parliamentarian’s review, the bill “remains largely intact.” “The bill, when passed, will meet all of our goals – fighting climate change, lowering health care costs, closing tax loopholes abused by the wealthy and reducing the deficit,” the New York Democrat said.  In a key ruling, the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, allowed a major component of the Democrats’ prescription drug pricing plans to move ahead – giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs for the first time. But MacDonough narrowed another provision aimed at lowering drug prices – imposing penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation. Democrats had wanted the measure to apply both to Medicare and the private insurance market. But the parliamentarian ruled the inflation cap could only apply to Medicare, a Democratic aide said. Meanwhile, MacDonough ruled to keep intact several climate measures from the Environment and Public Works Committee in the reconciliation bill, including a methane fee that would apply to oil and gas producers leaking the potent greenhouse gas methane above a certain threshold. Earlier Saturday, Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden of Oregon announced that the clean energy tax portion of the bill “adheres to Senate rules, and important provisions to ensure our clean energy future is built in America have been approved by the parliamentarian.”  How the bill addresses the climate crisis  For a party that failed to pass major climate legislation over 10 years ago, the reconciliation bill represents a major, long-fought victory for Democrats. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet. Analysis from Schumer’s office – as well as multiple independent analyses – suggests the measures would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to Biden’s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030.  The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what’s needed to combat the climate crisis. “This isn’t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. “We all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.” Key health care and tax policy in the bill  The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors’ offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. This controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way they wouldn’t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats’ plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear. However, Sinema nixed her party’s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%.  The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers’ profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies’ stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.

242,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/primary-election-results-arizona-michigan-missouri-2022,"Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump last year, has lost to a fervent election denier running with Trump’s support, CNN projected early Wednesday.  Republicans in Michigan and Arizona – two states at the center of Trump’s 2020 election denial campaign – voted on Tuesday in primaries for crucial federal and state contests as the shape of the 2022 midterms comes into focus less than a hundred days from Election Day.  Trump’s picks will win the GOP gubernatorial nod in Michigan as well as the GOP nominations for US Senate, secretary of state and attorney general in Arizona, CNN projects. In Arizona, one significant loss was that of state House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who delivered emotional testimony before the House January 6 committee about his resolve in the face of enormous pressure to overturn the 2020 results. He’ll lose a GOP state Senate primary, CNN projected early Wednesday.  Trump’s loss in those battleground states two years ago seeded right-wing anger and turned Republican primary campaigns up and down the ballot into referendums on his election lies. Allies of the former President sought offices crucial to the balance of power in Washington and in state governments, where the GOP is hoping to gain control of the election apparatus ahead of the 2024 presidential contest. With his loss to former Trump administration official John Gibbs, Meijer becomes the second of the so-called “impeachment 10” to lose reelection after South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice lost to a Trump-backed challenger in June.  Two others – Washington Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – were also facing challengers from their own party on Tuesday, but CNN has not yet projected whether they’ll be advancing to the general election. (Under Washington’s primary system, the top two finishers regardless of party advance to November.) Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, perhaps the most high-profile of the House Republicans to have voted for impeachment because of her role as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, faces a Trump-backed opponent later this month.  One of the impeachment 10 – California Rep. David Valadao – survived earlier this year, advancing to the November election in the Golden State’s top two system, while four of the Republicans who voted for impeachment are not running for reelection. Meijer’s primary in his western Michigan district had become a flashpoint in both parties’ national infighting because Gibbs was the beneficiary of Democratic meddling. The party’s House campaign arm, believing that Gibbs would be a less viable general election candidate, ran more than $300,000 in ads ostensibly attacking his alliance with Trump with the goal of boosting him in the primary. But that strategy angered some on the left who thought it undermined their broader messaging against political extremism in the GOP, while sparking fears the gamble could backfire if Gibbs makes it to Congress.  As CNN’s KFILE first reported in 2018, Gibbs has a history of conspiratorial and inflammatory tweets and defended a notorious anti-Semitic troll banned by Twitter. In Michigan’s gubernatorial primary, Trump-backed Tudor Dixon had the support of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and benefited from the disqualification of five would-be candidates after thousands of forged signatures were found on nominating petitions. A conservative commentator who had coalesced support from prominent Republicans in the state, Dixon beat back criticism that she was an establishment candidate who wasn’t “MAGA” enough. Dixon will be taking on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is seeking a second term. Whitmer is a key piece of the Democratic bulwark against Republican power in Michigan, where the GOP controls both legislative chambers.  Tuesday also provided voters with their first chance to directly respond to the US Supreme Court’s striking down of federal abortion rights earlier this summer – an issue that national Democrats hope will energize their base in the fall. Kansas voters have decided to maintain the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution by voting “no” on a proposed constitutional amendment, CNN projects. The procedure is currently legal up to 22 weeks in Kansas, where people from Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri have traveled for services amid Republican-led efforts to roll back abortion rights. Senate primaries will set crucial fall matchups   In Missouri, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt will win the GOP Senate nomination, CNN projects. His victory is a relief for national party leadership anxious that former Gov. Eric Greitens would win and then lose the general election in November. Greitens had resigned in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct and more recently faced allegations of abuse from his ex-wife, which he has denied.   Schmitt and Greitens shared an 11th-hour endorsement from Trump, who said on Monday he was backing “Eric” and leaving it up to voters to decide which one, although both candidates immediately tried to claim the endorsement for themselves.  Echoing a pledge from Greitens, Schmitt – who was endorsed by Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah – said last week that he would not support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for leader. While Trump hedged his bets, the state’s junior senator, Josh Hawley, suffered a loss after backing Rep. Vicky Hartzler. One of two members of Congress seeking the nomination, she was critical of Trump in the aftermath of January 6, but still voted against certifying the presidential vote and touted her voting record with Trump on the trail.  In Arizona, Blake Masters, an acolyte of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel who was Trump’s pick in that race, won the Republicans’ nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in November, CNN projects.  A proxy war between Trump and Pence The race to succeed term-limited Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey split the party, with Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence endorsing Karrin Taylor Robson and Trump backing former television reporter Kari Lake, whose campaign was fueled by the former President’s election lies. Down the ballot in Arizona, Trump-backed election-denying state Rep. Mark Finchem, who attended the January 6, 2021, rally in Washington, will win the Republican nomination for Arizona Secretary of State, CNN projects. The Democratic primary for Arizona Secretary of State remains too early to call. And in the attorney general’s race, Trump’s preferred candidate, election denier Abraham Hamadeh, won the Republican nomination, CNN projects. Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs will win the Democratic nod for governor, CNN projects.  Moderate prevails in member vs. member primary  Besides the GOP drama in Michigan’s 3rd District, Meanwhile, in Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, Rep. Haley Stevens will defeat fellow Democratic Rep. Andy Levin, CNN projects, in a clash of incumbents that was the latest chapter of a proxy fight between moderates and progressives. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) had backed Stevens and its new super PAC, United Democracy Project, spent more than $4 million to boost her bid. UDP’s outlay, along with bundling by AIPAC, spurred another pro-Israel group, the liberal J Street, to jump in on Levin’s behalf, splashing $700,000 in a July ad buy for him.

159,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/trump-justice-department-january-6-criminal-investigation/,"Former President Donald Trump’s legal team is in direct communication with Justice Department officials, the first sign of talks between the two sides as the criminal probe into January 6, 2021, accelerates, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. The talks revolve around whether Trump would be able to shield conversations he had while he was president from federal investigators. In recent weeks, investigators have moved aggressively into Trump’s orbit, subpoenaing top former White House officials, focusing on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and executing searches of lawyers who sought to aid those efforts. The Trump team’s discussions are with the US attorney’s office in Washington, DC, which is in charge of the investigation, and its top January 6 prosecutor Thomas Windom, the sources said. The conversations have not been previously reported. At this stage, the conversations are focused mostly on whether any communications that witnesses from the Trump West Wing had with the former President can be kept from a federal criminal grand jury under Trump’s claims of executive privilege, the people said. The Justice Department has been anticipating a court fight with Trump over executive privilege. The issue has arisen as grand jury subpoenas have been issued to two former White House counsel’s office officials and to former Vice President Mike Pence’s chief counsel and chief of staff. Trump’s legal defense team has warned him that indictments are possible, sources tell CNN. Some members of Trump’s legal team have discussed his potential defense strategies on at least two occasions in recent months, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as they brace for new developments in the Justice Department probe and a separate investigation by Georgia officials into his potentially criminal meddling in the state’s 2020 election results. Rolling Stone previously reported that Trump had been briefed. Trump has grilled his attorneys on whether they actually believe he will face formal charges, sources said. Yet the former President has expressed a heavy dose of skepticism that he will be indicted, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.  Another source close to the former President told CNN that Trump also has posed questions about a potential indictment to members of his inner circle, some of whom believe the President is concerned about the possibility of federal charges.  But one person close to Trump said he is noticeably more engaged when he is chatting with friends and advisers about the 2022 midterms and his possible presidential campaign in 2024 than he has been during briefings on legal strategy. This person described the former President as dismissive in conversations about his legal troubles, often repeating his “witch hunt” mantra as he claims the various probes he’s facing are plainly driven by political opponents.  A Trump spokesman said in a statement to CNN: “There is clearly a concerted effort to undermine the vital, Constitutionally-rooted Executive and Attorney-Client Privileges through partisan, political persecution.”  “How can any future President ever have private conversations with his attorneys, counselors, and other senior advisors if any such advisor is forced, either during or after the Presidency, in front of an Unselect Committee or other entity, and be forced to reveal those privileged, confidential discussions?” the spokesman said. “President Trump will not be deterred by witch hunts or kangaroo courts from continuing to defend and fight for America, our Constitution, and the Truth.”  The Justice Department declined to comment. Mark Meadows could be a key witness In recent months, the former President has ignored advice from some of his advisers to avoid speaking with former and current aides who have become entangled in the House select committee’s probe into January 6 and may become part of the criminal investigation, people familiar with the matter told CNN.   Trump has specifically been counseled to cut contact with his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, whose actions leading up to and on the day of the US Capitol insurrection have been deeply scrutinized by the House panel, the people said. Two of Meadows’ former top aides, Cassidy Hutchinson and Alyssa Farah Griffin, also have been highly critical of Trump, with Hutchinson testifying about damaging details about Trump’s actions on January 6 during her public testimony before the House panel in June. Hutchinson is cooperating in the DOJ probe as well.  Some of Trump’s attorneys believe Meadows could also be in investigators’ crosshairs and are concerned he could become a fact witness if he is pushed to cooperate in the Justice Department probe, according to two people familiar with the matter. In response, Meadows’ attorney George Terwilliger told CNN on Thursday: “All of that is idle and uninformed speculation, apparently by people that know little but talk a lot.” Former White House attorney Ty Cobb said Meadows is “perfectly positioned to be the John Dean of this mess,” referring to the former Richard Nixon aide who offered crucial public testimony during the Watergate hearings. “The reason [Meadows] is valuable is also the reason he is in jeopardy: He was basically at Trump’s right hand throughout all these exercises and participated in key meetings and phone calls,” Cobb said.   Yet, according to a source familiar with the relationship, Trump and Meadows have spoken a number of times. Another source close to Trump described their relationship as “not the same as it once was” while they served in the White House, but insisted they still maintained a relationship, even as Trump has complained about Meadows in his recent conversations with other allies. Meadows has been known to attend fundraisers and events at the former President’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he also helped organize a donor retreat last April for the Conservative Partnership Institute, a group he runs with former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint. The securing of Trump’s endorsement for US Senate candidate Ted Budd “was the last time Meadows was really around regularly. Since then, he’s never been a big part of the political operation or [Trump’s] thought process,” said a second person close to Trump.

540,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/opinions/afghanistan-exit-a-year-later-bergen/,"Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. Bergen’s new paperback is “The Rise and fall of Osama bin Laden.” from which this article is, in part, adapted. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. In 1961, after a CIA-backed invasion of Cuba failed spectacularly, President John F. Kennedy said of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, “Victory has 100 fathers and defeat is an orphan.”  Last week, President Joe Biden took a victory lap when he announced that the US had tracked down and killed its most wanted terrorist, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was living in a house in Kabul, Afghanistan. Don’t expect a similar celebration on August 30, the first anniversary of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which ended the longest war in American history. Any realistic assessment of that action shows that it will long be seen as a defeat rather than a victory – and it’s likely no one will own up to the responsibility for the decision.  The US launched a war against Afghanistan in 2001 after the Taliban regime harbored Osama bin Laden, giving him the ability to plot and carry out the 9/11 terrorist attacks which killed almost 3,000 Americans.  As US and NATO troops battled Taliban and al Qaeda forces, the new US-backed government in Kabul also presided over two decades of progress in Afghanistan. To be sure, Afghanistan wasn’t Norway, but it was becoming a somewhat functional, democratizing Central Asian state that saw striking progress in reducing child mortality and increasing life expectancy, one that provided jobs for women and education for millions of girls; it nurtured scores of independent media outlets, and held regular, if flawed, presidential elections.   All of that changed when the US began withdrawing and the Taliban took over the entire country on August 15, 2021. Women’s rights evaporated. They have no right to work, except in a narrow set of female-related jobs such as cleaning women’s toilets in Kabul;  when they travel distances of more than 45 miles they must be accompanied by a male relative,  and the Taliban have ordered women to stay at home and to cover themselves completely should they ever venture out. Their male relatives will be punished by the Taliban if women don’t follow these directives. Girls do not have the right to be educated after the age of 12.   On the Taliban’s  management of Afghanistan, one data point suffices to underline the  group’s gross incompetence: Around half of the Afghan population are today “facing acute hunger,” according to the UN.  On the Taliban’s respect for other ethnic Afghan groups: There is no evidence that the Taliban are creating an “inclusive” government as their leaders claimed they would. Pashtuns make up almost all the leadership of the Taliban, while other ethnic groups in Afghanistan such as the Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks are almost entirely excluded from leadership roles.   On their respect for democracy: The Taliban, conveniently, don’t believe in elections. Instead, they are a theocracy; their leader is known as the “Commander of the Faithful,” a title that claims he is the leader of all Muslims. In the past year under Taliban rule, 40% of Afghanistan’s independent media outlets have closed.  On the Taliban’s alliance with al Qaeda: Well, last week’s news made clear the relationship is thriving. The fact that the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri was living in downtown Kabul for months – with what the Biden administration describes as the awareness of some Taliban officials – speaks for itself. Zawahiri was killed late last month in a US drone strike.   After the news broke that Zawahiri had been hiding in Kabul, Lisa Curtis, the top official at the White House for Afghanistan during the Trump administration, tweeted “#Taliban basically asserting Doha agreement allows them to shelter #AlQaeda. Proves it was the worst agreement in US history. Not worth the paper on which it’s written.” This was a particularly damning assessment coming from a senior American official who was working on Afghanistan while the Doha agreement between the US and the Taliban was being negotiated.  One of the most powerful men in Afghanistan today is the acting Minister of Interior, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who has ties to al Qaeda, according to a United Nations report that said he is “assessed to be a member of the wider Al-Qaida leadership, but not of the Al-Qaida core leadership.”  A February 2020 opinion piece in The New York Times with Haqqani’s byline blandly identified him only as “the deputy leader of the Taliban.” What the Times didn’t tell its readers is that Haqqani was also on the FBI’s most wanted list and that his men had kidnapped a reporter for … The New York Times.   This op-ed featured ludicrous lies including, “We together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam – from the right to education to the right to work – are protected” and “reports about foreign [terrorist] groups in Afghanistan are politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war.”  How it happened The US pullout from Afghanistan a year ago was orchestrated by a successive series of decisions by former President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden and the chief US negotiator with the Taliban, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad. None of these men are ever likely to fully acknowledge their paternity of the debacle that unfolded in Afghanistan, which followed the worst diplomatic agreement in US history that enabled the Taliban to win at the negotiating table in Doha, Qatar what they could never win on the battlefield. Khalilzad has defended the deal saying, “The negotiation was a result of–based on the judgment that we weren’t winning the war and therefore time was not on our side and better to make a deal sooner than later.”  By the end of the Trump administration, the fledgling Afghan state was supported by only some 2,500 US troops, a tiny fraction of the more than two million men and women in the active-duty US military, reserves, and National Guard units. Assisted by 9,000 allied, mostly NATO troops and 18,000 contractors this small US force was enough to enable the Afghan military to fend off the Taliban, which was never able to capture and hold any of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals before Biden announced the total American withdrawal in April 2021.    Why Biden went through with the withdrawal plan that he had inherited from Trump is still something of a puzzle since there was no large, vocal constituency in the Democratic Party that was demanding a total US pullout from Afghanistan, and Biden’s top military advisers had clearly warned him of the risks of doing so. In public testimony before the US Senate Armed Services Committee,  US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and US CENTCOM commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, said they had advised the Biden administration that unless the US kept around 2,500 troops in Afghanistan, the Afghan military would collapse. Collapse it did.    The “Taliban 2.0” delusion The publication of Haqqani’s op-ed in The New York Times was emblematic of the wishful thinking about the Taliban in the   US that had persisted for years. In this view the Taliban were just a bunch of misunderstood backwoodsmen who would eventually do what was only sensible: break with al Qaeda and abandon much of their misogynistic ideology as a quid pro quo for their recognition on the world stage.  This was a classic case of mirror imaging; the belief that the Taliban would do the rational things some gullible Americans expected them to do, as opposed to implementing the quasi-mediaeval ideology that has been at the core of their armed movement since they first emerged almost three decades ago. It was like imagining the Khmer Rouge would “mature” once they had taken power in Cambodia.  A key proponent of the view that the Taliban would change if the right carrots were dangled in front of them was Barnett Rubin of NYU, an expert on Afghanistan, who claimed in a paper that he published with the United States Institute of Peace in March 2021 that the  US had “underestimated the leverage that the Taliban’s quest for sanctions relief, recognition and international assistance provides.”    Turns out that it was Rubin who overestimated how much the Taliban cared about sanctions relief and international assistance, while he had also vastly underestimated their desire to banish women from jobs and education and maintain their warm relations with their old buddies in al Qaeda. This shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, since that was exactly how the Taliban had ruled the last time that they were in power in the years before 9/11. The Taliban hadn’t fought the US and Afghan militaries for two decades only to install a quasi-democracy when they came to power for the second time. The “moderate” Taliban 2.0 that was supposedly emerging in recent years was a profound delusion that gripped US policymakers.   A month after Biden had announced the impending withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan, the US negotiator with the Taliban, Khalilzad, testified to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 16, 2021, that those who thought the Taliban would quickly take over the country as the US pulled out were “mistaken.” Khalilzad also asserted that the Taliban would opt for a political settlement over a military victory, testifying, “They say they seek normalcy in terms of relations — acceptability, removal from sanctions, not to remain a pariah.”   Just months later the distinctive white flags of the Taliban were fluttering over the capital, Kabul, and the Taliban began implementing their theocratic state. In a symbolic move the Taliban’s feared religious police soon commandeered what had formerly been the ministry for women’s affairs. Obviously, that ministry would no longer be needed, but the “Vice and Virtue” police would have to be properly accommodated.   The United Nations released a report in May in which it observed that an astonishing 41 members of the Taliban serving in the cabinet or other senior-level government positions in Afghanistan are on UN sanctions lists.    Taliban 2.0 was a mirage, and the Taliban today is Taliban 1.0 with one major difference; they are far better armed than the Taliban that ruled over most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Now they ride into battle with American armored vehicles and M-16 rifles that were left behind as the US military rushed for the exits last summer.  The Taliban today also face a far weaker opposition movement in Afghanistan than was the case for the pre-9/11 Taliban.    Signaling weakness to Russia and China  When Biden spoke to the American people on  Aug. 31, 2021, as the last US soldiers departed Afghanistan, he framed the withdrawal as a way of positioning the US to compete better against great-power rivals, saying, “We’re engaged in a serious competition with China. We’re dealing with the challenges on multiple fronts with Russia…And there’s nothing China or Russia would rather have, would want more in this competition than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan.” This was an absurd rationale: For years both China and Russia had hoped to push American forces out of Afghanistan because the country borders both China and the republics of the former Soviet Union. Russia had covertly supported the Taliban, according to the US military, while the Chinese had drawn closer to the Taliban in recent years.   As they pulled out of Afghanistan, the Americans abandoned the vast Bagram Air Base which could house up to 10,000 troops; a more ideal site from which to engage in competition with either China or Russia is hard to imagine.   You could practically hear the high fives in the Kremlin as the US ignominiously retreated from Afghanistan, which seemed to herald an era of the US pulling back from the world. It hardly seems accidental that three months later Russian President Vladimir Putin moved an army to the border with Ukraine as a prelude to his invasion of the country.    A predictable fiasco In June 2021, I wrote for CNN, “We could see in Afghanistan a remix of the disastrous US pullout from Saigon in 1975 and the summer of 2014 in Iraq when ISIS took over much of the country following the US pullout from the country.”   That prediction, unfortunately, proved to be accurate; the American pullout from Saigon looked like a dignified retreat compared to the scenes of thousands of desperate Afghans trying to get on planes leaving Kabul airport last August. Some Afghans were so desperate to leave that they clung to the fuselage of a plane that was taking off – and two plunged to their deaths. On  Aug. 25, 2021, 13 US soldiers and at least 170 Afghans were killed at the airport by a suicide bomber dispatched by the Afghan branch of ISIS. And the Taliban took over the entire country even before the last US soldiers had left Afghanistan. Compounding Biden’s disastrous policy decision to completely pull out of Afghanistan was the botched handling of the withdrawal. According to a report about that withdrawal released in February by Republican senators sitting on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the first White House meeting to discuss evacuating Americans and Afghans from Afghanistan took place on Aug. 14, only one day before the Taliban seized Kabul and five months after Biden had first publicly announced the total US withdrawal from the country.    Biden patted himself on the back that the US military subsequently extracted 124,000 Afghans from Afghanistan, calling the operation an “extraordinary success,” which was like an arsonist praising himself for helping to try to put out a fire that he had started.  But even accepting the most self-congratulatory view of the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal, the vast majority of the Afghans who had worked with the US were abandoned. The Association of Wartime Allies, an advocacy group for Afghans who had worked for the US, estimated in March that only about 3% of the 81,000 Afghans who had worked for the US government and had applied for special visas had made it out of Afghanistan, leaving 78,000 behind.  Four months after the Taliban took over Afghanistan, the Biden administration convened the “Summit for Democracy” in Washington consisting of the world’s democracies. Five months earlier Afghanistan would have warranted an invitation to this summit, but Biden had enabled the Taliban to take over the country, which ended almost every shred of a liberal democracy that had once existed there. Following the Afghan debacle, Biden’s favorable ratings dropped to the lowest level of his presidency to that point to 46%. They have never recovered.  The Biden administration now faces a policy dilemma of its own making. Since so many millions of Afghans are on the brink of starvation, Biden officials cannot completely turn their backs on Afghanistan. And yet, it’s hard to help Afghans without propping up the Taliban in some manner. The Biden administration has tried to ensure that all US aid to Afghanistan is administered in a way that it doesn’t end up in the hands of the Taliban, but realistically any help that the US sends to Afghanistan tends to help the Taliban remain in power.  This is surely one of the most spectacular own goals the US has ever scored.",Peter Bergen;Peter Bergen;Ayman Al-Zawahiri;Joe Biden,Arizona State University;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"EDUCATION,93;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,93;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYST,45;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,37;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,37;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,37;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,37;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,662;TERROR,651;ARMEDCONFLICT,651;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,64;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,669;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,133;KILL,625;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,625;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,37;LEADER,64;LEADER,400;LEADER,540;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,64;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,400;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,540;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,64;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,400;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,540;WB_756_VULNERABLE_GROUPS,501;WB_421_SOCIAL_INCLUSION,501;WB_758_ORPHANS,501;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,501;TAX_FNCACT_FATHERS,479;",Cuba;Bay Of Pigs;Arizona;America;Afghanistan;Kabul,3215
170,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/pelosi-demilitarized-zone-south-korea/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that a congressional delegation traveled to South Korea and visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone that divides North and South Korea. “It was a privilege to engage with American heroes in uniform on the ground in Korea, led by General Paul LaCamera, Commander, U.S. Forces Korea. During visits to the Demilitarized Zone/Joint Security Area (DMZ/JSA) and Osan Air Base, we conveyed the gratitude of the Congress and the Country for the patriotic service of our Servicemembers, who stand as sentinels of Democracy on the Korean peninsula,” Pelosi said in the statement. The DMZ is a 160-mile-long no-man’s land about 30 miles north of Seoul that was established in the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement. It is often described as the world’s most heavily armed border.  Pelosi said the delegation also visited Seoul and praised what she described as “a strong bond” between the US and South Korea.  “The United States and South Korea share a strong bond formed for security and forged by decades of warm friendship. Our Congressional delegation traveled to Seoul to reaffirm our treasured ties and our shared commitment to advancing security and stability, economic growth and democratic governance,” Pelosi said.  Pelosi said the delegation was “honored to be hosted” at a parliamentary meeting “where we reaffirmed our commitment to the U.S.-Korea alliance” and “was pleased to engage in a phone meeting with Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol.”  Providing a readout of the call, Pelosi said, “we thanked the President for Korea’s hospitality of 28,000 U.S. Servicemembers and their families. Each Member engaged in conversation with the President, highlighting areas of continued cooperation to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.”  The announcement comes after Pelosi recently visited Taiwan amid threats of Chinese retaliation. Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan. Pelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

581,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/investing/stocks-week-ahead/,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. After the Federal Reserve’s July meeting, investors quickly reached a consensus: The central bank was turning slightly dovish. After embarking on an aggressive rate-hike spree this year in a bid to fight inflation, the Fed indicated it could downgrade the size of its hikes moving forward. “We’ve been front-end loading these very large rate increases, and now we’re getting closer to where we need to be,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters. Of course, Powell said, another “unusually large” increase could be on the table too. But Wall Street looked past that. What came next: Investors cheered Powell’s apparent pivot. The S&P 500 rallied, notching its best month since November 2020, and financial conditions eased. Mortgage rates fell below 5% for the first time since mid-April. Now, Fed officials are trying to set the record straight. Not wanting markets to change course too sharply, reversing the effects of their hard work thus far, they’ve been talking tough again. “[We’re] nowhere near almost done,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said in an interview on LinkedIn last week. Loretta Mester, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the Washington Post that it “would be inappropriate … to cry victory too early” and risk letting high inflation become entrenched.  “We need to see really compelling evidence that inflation is moving down, and my view is that we haven’t seen that yet,” Mester said. As the Fed tries to bring demand back down so it stops running up against limited supply — pushing up prices — it’s closely watching the labor market, which has remained strong. While job openings fell in June, the US economy continues to add jobs at a healthy pace. A blowout July report released Friday showed a gain of 528,000 positions last month. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5%. The news poured cold water on the theory that the Fed would change its approach dramatically any time soon. The central bank actually wants to see some weakening in the job market. When there are too many open roles, wages rise quickly, which can make economy-wide inflation even worse. “This isn’t the news the Fed wanted to hear, and this will likely cause it to push rates higher, faster,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. Investors have come back around: The stock market on Friday predicted a 66% chance of a three-quarter-point rate hike in September, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. On Thursday, the market had priced in just a 34% chance of a hike that high.  Coming up: The next big data release is the Consumer Price Index, which is used to track US inflation. Economists polled by Refinitiv expect to learn that prices rose 8.7% in the year to July, down slightly from June. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation may have inched higher. America’s strong dollar is hurting everyone else The US dollar has been on a tear this year. That’s good news for American tourists gallivanting around Europe, but bad news for pretty much every other country in the world.  The latest: The greenback is up more than 10% in 2022 compared to other top currencies — near its highest level in two decades — as investors worried about a global recession have rushed to scoop up dollars, which are considered a safe haven in turbulent times. Adding to the dollar’s appeal is the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes to tackle decades-high inflation. That’s made American investments more attractive, since they now offer higher returns. US travelers may be rejoicing that a night out in Rome that once cost $100 now costs about $80, but it’s a more complicated picture for multinational companies and foreign governments. See here: About half of international trade is invoiced in dollars, running up bills for manufacturers and small businesses that rely on imported goods. Governments that need to repay their debts in dollars could also run into trouble, especially if reserves run low. The dollar’s gain is already hurting some vulnerable economies. A shortage of dollars in Sri Lanka contributed to the worst economic crisis in the country’s history, ultimately forcing the country’s president out of office last month. Pakistan’s rupee plunged to a record low against the dollar in late July, pushing it to the brink of default. And Egypt — battered by rising food prices — is dealing with a depleted store of dollars and an exodus of foreign investment. All three countries have had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help.  “It’s been a challenging environment,” William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, told me.

650,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-taiwan-military-exercises-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/,"China’s military exercises around Taiwan this week aim to send a pointed message to governments in Taipei, Tokyo and Washington that Beijing alone calls the shots in the Taiwan Strait, analysts say. Experts also suggest the announcement of the drills shortly after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday was no snap reaction to her controversial visit – rather, the exercises are part of a relentless, years-long plan to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. Pelosi’s trip to the island – a democracy of 24 million that the Chinese Communist Party regards as its territory despite having never controlled it – has merely thrust the issue of Taiwan into news headlines, analysts said. “That’s what Nancy Pelosi really accomplished, raising global awareness of China’s sustained military coercion campaign against Taiwan that’s been going on for more than a decade,” said Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. “They do this every year,” Thompson said of the Chinese exercises. “The difference this year is that we’re paying attention.”  Reaction in Taipei, Tokyo and Washington The government in Taipei is certainly on alert, announcing Friday that multiple Chinese warships and jets had crossed the median line – the midway point between the mainland and Taiwan that Beijing says it does not recognize but usually respects. After China sent ballistic missiles over the island Thursday, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen vowed to “firmly defend our sovereignty and national security, and stick to the line of defense of democracy and freedom.” Those missiles got the attention of Japan, too. Five of them landed inside Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone, an area of the ocean where a country enjoys special rights to resources like fishing and mining under the seabed. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the Chinese drills were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people.” He called for an immediate halt to them and said Japan would work with its closest ally, the United States, “to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait.” Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the ASEAN-US Ministerial meeting in Cambodia, said, “I hope very much that Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” But in Washington, the official line was that Beijing’s actions came as no surprise. “We anticipated that China might take steps like this – in fact, I described them for you in quite some detail just the other day,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We also expect that these actions will continue and that the Chinese will continue to react in the coming days.”  Isolating Taiwan Visiting with Kishida on Friday, Pelosi said Beijing was trying to “isolate” Taiwan. China’s exercises were designed to practice doing exactly that, said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii. “China (is showing) it can bombard Taiwan with missiles and isolate it from outside support and affect air and maritime trade through the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan,” Schuster said. That’s long been Beijing’s plan, and this week’s exercises are just the manifestation of at least months of planning and years of policy, the experts said. “An exercise of this size, scope and complexity cannot be planned and the forces prepared in two weeks,” Schuster said, referring to the period following rumors of Pelosi’s trip to the island. He said the outlines of the Chinese military exercises were likely decided a year ago and most of the actions set by April.  Parts of the drills, like the multiple ballistic missile launches, could have been added in the past few weeks as the logistics of those are not as complicated as say, setting up a naval blockade, which Beijing said was one of its practice points for the exercises.  Drills ‘to intimidate the US and Japan’ Schuster also noted that the exercises are larger than those China has organized in previous years. “This expanded exercise activity has a third purpose – to intimidate the US and Japan – both of which have indicated their support for Taiwan,” Schuster said. “If you look at the rhetoric from January to April, (Chinese President Xi Jinping) and company were ramping up criticism of the US and Japan, the latter over recent statements of support for Taiwan and its increased defense spending.” Japan’s 2022 Defense White Paper, an annual look at its security policy published in late July, called out Beijing in no uncertain terms. “China continues to unilaterally change or attempt to change the status quo by coercion in the East China Sea and South China Sea,” it says. “Furthermore, China has made clear that it would not hesitate to unify Taiwan by force, further increasing tensions in the region.” In a virtual speech to a Taiwanese think tank last December, the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said an armed invasion of Taiwan would be a grave danger to Japan. “People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should never have a misunderstanding in recognizing this,” Abe said.  Perhaps Beijing wasn’t listening or just doesn’t care. The exercises – particularly the launching of missiles that landed in Japan’s EEZ – show that, experts said. “They have validated Shinzo Abe’s concerns that at a Taiwan emergency is a Japan emergency and an emergency for the US-Japan alliance,” Thompson, of the National University of Singapore, said. And that emergency can be expected to continue. Bringing Taiwan into Beijing’s control is a bedrock of Chinese policy. On Friday, China continued its exercises and military intimidation unabated. Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang acknowledged the exercises were having the effect Beijing desires, showing how it can control the Taiwan Strait. “The evil neighbor next door flexed its muscles on our doorstep and arbitrarily sabotaged (one of) the busiest waterways in the world with military exercises,” he said.",Fumio Kishida;Shinzo Abe;Shinzo Abe;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Hector Retamal;Hector Retamal;Antony Blinken;John Kirby;Carl Schuster,Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public;National University Of Singapore;National University Of Singapore;Us Pacific Command Joint Intelligence Center;Us National Security Council;Chinese Communist Party;United States;United States;United States;United States,"EDUCATION,1028;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1028;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,2148;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,5844;EPU_UNCERTAINTY,5449;MARITIME,3660;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1847;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2231;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2968;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,5375;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,5777;TAX_ETHNICITY_TAIWANESE,6768;SLFID_MILITARY_SPENDING,5312;EPU_CATS_FISCAL_POLICY,5312;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,2454;ARMEDCONFLICT,3581;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1847;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,2968;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1847;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2968;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1847;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,2968;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1847;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,2968;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,636;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2008;WB_862_GROWTH_POLES_AND_ECONOMIC_ZONES,2008;WB_346_COMPETITIVE_INDUSTRIES,2008;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2604;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,327;LEADER,1776;LEADER,5159;LEADER,5961;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1776;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,5159;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,5961;ALLIANCE,6493;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,636;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2713;TAX_ETHNICITY_JAPANESE,2133;TAX_ETHNICITY_JAPANESE,5829;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_JAPANESE,2133;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_JAPANESE,5829;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,237;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,773;BLOCKADE,4397;SEIGE,4397;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1449;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1449;MEDIA_MSM,2993;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3470;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,2939;AFFECT,3645;INFO_RUMOR,4042;EPU_ECONOMY,2003;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2003;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,630;WB_137_WATER,3176;ENV_MINING,2104;USPEC_POLICY1,1045;USPEC_POLICY1,3870;USPEC_POLICY1,5382;USPEC_POLICY1,6677;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1045;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,3870;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,5382;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,6677;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,2148;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,5844;SOVEREIGNTY,1827;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,5312;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1072;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,6533;WB_698_TRADE,3666;DEMOCRACY,591;DEMOCRACY,1893;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,591;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,1893;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,296;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,2186;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4218;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,4786;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2031;MARITIME_PIRACY,3180;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,3012;ENV_WATERWAYS,7035;WB_1805_WATERWAYS,7035;WB_135_TRANSPORT,7035;WB_1803_TRANSPORT_INFRASTRUCTURE,7035;TAX_WEAPONS_WARSHIPS,1540;WB_818_INDUSTRY_POLICY_AND_REAL_SECTORS,2595;WB_1281_MANUFACTURING,2595;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,620;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1143;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1531;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2179;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,3092;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,4110;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,4485;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,4620;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,5149;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6069;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,6670;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,620;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1143;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1531;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2179;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,3092;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,4110;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,4485;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,4620;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,5149;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6069;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,6670;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2445;",Chinese;Tingshu;Japan;Taiwan;South China Sea;Beijing;Taipei;Taiwanese;China;Taiwan Strait;Japanese;Pingtan;Fujian;Cambodia;Hawaii;East China Sea;Tokyo;United States;Washington,1204
95,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/weather/kentucky-appalachia-flooding-sunday/,"At least 28 people have died in last week’s flooding in Kentucky as rescuers continue to search for missing people and the region braces for yet more rain. “Our confirmed count of Kentuckians we’ve lost has now reached 28, and we expect that there will be more, and that that number will grow,” Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday. The devastating flooding Thursday was unprecedented, officials said, inundating houses and sweeping some from their foundations. “This is one of the most devastating deadly floods that we have seen in our history,” Beshear said on NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday. “It wiped out areas where people didn’t have that much to begin with.” “We’re going to be finding bodies for weeks, many of them swept hundreds of yards, maybe a quarter-mile plus from where they were last,” the governor said.   Now, more rainfall is in the forecast that threatens some areas hardest-hit by the deadly flooding. “The forecast is concerning, and we’re watching it very closely, obviously. We also are sending out warnings and making sure everyone knows,” said Col. Jeremy Slinker, the Kentucky emergency management director. “We’re preparing for it and making sure all the residents there are prepared for it because we just don’t want to lose anyone else or have any more tragedy,” he told CNN’s Pamela Brown Saturday.  A flood watch is in effect through at least Monday morning for parts of southern and eastern Kentucky, according to the National Weather Service, and there is a Level 3 of 4 moderate risk for excessive rainfall Sunday across southeastern Kentucky, per the Weather Prediction Center, escalating the concern of additional flooding.  “The threat of flash flooding will be gradually increasing as showers and thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall rates develop and expand in coverage today,” the center said, deeming the atmospheric conditions in the area as “tropical in nature,” meaning it is warm, moist and can support an incredible amount of water. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are forecast over the next 24 to 48 hours, but as much as 4 or 5 inches is possible in localized areas. As little as 1 to 2 inches can revive flooding concerns, particularly in areas already inundated with heavy rain where the soil is saturated.  Some areas remain unreachable, governor says Officials believe thousands have been affected, and efforts to rebuild some areas may take years, the governor told CNN Saturday. The state’s estimated losses are potentially in the “tens if not the hundreds of millions of dollars.” In Perry County alone, approximately 50 bridges were washed away, County Judge Executive Scott Alexander said at a news conference Sunday morning, calling it “the biggest event that I’m aware of that Perry County has ever faced.”   State officials Sunday were working to open Buckhorn State Park to house a number of those who lost their homes, the governor said at the news conference, adding he hoped to announce the state park could be used as a shelter soon. “We recognize that the hotels and motels here are full, the shelters are full, that people are sleeping in their cars and trucks and we don’t need that,” Beshear said.  After the rain, excessive heat is expected to build over the region Tuesday as many people are currently struggling with no access to clean drinking water, power outages and cell service still out in some counties Sunday. “We have multiple Kentucky State Police posts that are taking calls from loved ones that can’t connect with those that they are worried about,” the governor told NBC Sunday. “But it’s going to take some time to get a firm grasp on that. We still can’t get into some areas to check on people.”  More than 13,000 homes and businesses in the region were in the dark early Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us; three drinking water systems were totally out of operation Saturday, the governor said, leaving residents without access to water, or only access to water which needed to be boiled before it could be safely consumed. The federal government sent tractor trailers of bottled water to the region, and more financial assistance is on the way. The flooding – as with other recent weather disasters – was further amplified by the climate crisis: As global temperatures climb as a result of human-caused fossil fuel emissions, the atmosphere is able to hold more water, making water vapor more abundantly available to fall as rain. Scientists are increasingly confident in the role the climate crisis plays in extreme weather, and have warned such events will become more intense and more dangerous with every fraction of a degree of warming.  Officials have moved swiftly to approve financial assistance, given the scores of people in need of relief after losing everything. The federal government greenlighted funding for people in five counties “at a pace that we’ve never seen before,” Kentucky Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman told CNN’s Pamela Brown Saturday. “Residents will actually receive direct payments, which is some really good news in what will be a very long tunnel to see the light,” Coleman said. Coleman did not provide an exact date on when those payments are expected to reach residents, though she said they will be dispersed as soon as the state receives the money. Nearly $700,000 has been raised for relief efforts, Beshear said Saturday, noting funeral expenses for those killed in the flooding will be paid for. Additionally, the state is prioritizing placing generators at the shelters for flood survivors as temperatures are expected to soar Tuesday following the rain.  ‘Hero’ rescued family from flooded home Among the tales of heroism emerging from the disaster is an unidentified man who drifted through fast-moving water to get a 98-year-old grandmother, her grandson and another family member out of their home as it was nearly swallowed by the flooding Thursday. Randy Polly, who witnessed the rescue in Whitesburg, Kentucky, and recorded parts of it on his cellphone, told CNN he got stuck a distance away from the home on his way to get gas Thursday morning. Polly said he heard people yelling across the flooded road, “Get me help, get help.” He called 911, but first responders were overwhelmed and unresponsive to his calls.  Around 9 a.m., he saw a man he described as a hero drift over to the house and start banging on the door and window. The man eventually helped get three people out of the home and guided them through rushing water, the videos show. The rescue took about 30 minutes, Polly said. Missy Crovetti, who lives in Green Oaks, Illinois, told CNN the people rescued in the video are her grandmother Mae Amburgey, uncle Larry Amburgey and brother Gregory Amburgey. They are safe and doing well, she said. Crovetti said she does not know the name of the man who rescued her family. Polly also said he does not know the man’s name. CNN’s Chris Boyett, Sharif Paget, Gene Norman, Derek Van Dam, Haley Brink, Jalen Beckford, Angela Fritz, Chuck Johnston and Raja Razek contributed to this report.

563,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/mike-pompeo-january-6-committee/,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the House January 6 committee on Tuesday, according to panel member Rep. Zoe Lofgren. The California Democrat confirmed CNN’s earlier reporting that Pompeo would be deposed by the committee, according to a source familiar with the matter.  CNN has previously reported on Pompeo’s negotiations with the committee about his testimony. The panel has shown an increased interest in members of former President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, particularly regarding conversations among Cabinet members about invoking the 25th Amendment after January 6, 2021, and the committee’s focus in the Pompeo interview was expected to be on the 25th Amendment, the source said. A portion of the 25th Amendment, which addresses presidential succession, allows a vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to vote to remove a president from office due to his inability to “discharge the powers and duties of his office.”  Pompeo served as CIA director for the first year of Trump’s presidency, and led the State Department for Trump’s final three years, where he was a stalwart Trump ally and defender. Lofgren refused to comment on the particulars of Pompeo’s testimony in an interview on Tuesday, but told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” that “he came in willingly, and he did answer questions for quite some time.” When asked if the committee learned any new information from Pompeo’s testimony, Lofgren said, “I think we fill in a few pieces here and there each time we interview someone. Obviously, we’ve had testimony from others about what he said and did. And so, it’s just a matter of filling out the entire picture, especially on that day and the events subsequent to that day, where the Cabinet secretaries had concerns about the President.”  The New York Times was first to report Pompeo’s expected appearance Tuesday. As discussions surrounding the 25th Amendment come into focus, the committee had also hoped to hear from Doug Mastriano, the Trump-endorsed Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.  However, Mastriano’s virtual appearance Tuesday only lasted about 15 minutes and “he didn’t answer a single question,” according to a source familiar with the matter. Mastriano’s attorney cut off the virtual appearance soon after it began, the source said. His lawyer, Tim Parlatore, took issue with several procedural matters related to the deposition, and raised questions about the legality of the subpoena that Mastriano received from the panel, the source added. Mastriano, a key figure in Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election, led a faux legislative “hearing” at a hotel in Gettysburg a few weeks after the 2020 election, where Trump and his then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani made false claims about election fraud. He also chartered buses to bring Trump supporters to Washington on January 6, and he was briefly in charge of the Pennsylvania state Senate’s partisan “audit” of the 2020 election. Last week, Mastriano threatened to walk out of a scheduled deposition before the House select committee unless the panel agreed to his conditions, potentially setting up a court fight over his testimony. In a letter to the committee, his attorney, Parlatore had said he would pull out of the scheduled deposition unless they could agree to certain accommodations. Parlatore asked that he be able to videotape the deposition, keep the footage in escrow, and release portions of it later on, if the committee publicly releases clips that he believes would require additional context. Several Trump Cabinet officials have already met with the committee, including Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia. Attorney General William Barr also met with the committee, but he had left the administration prior to the January 6 insurrection. This story has been updated with additional background information.

240,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/entertainment/monica-lewinsky-beyonce-lyric/,"Since Beyoncé is editing lyrics, Monica Lewinsky has a request. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who became embroiled in a sex scandal with then President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, tweeted the news of Beyoncé removing an abelist slur from the song “Heated” on her new album “Renaissance” with a suggestion. “uhmm, while we’re at it… #Partition,”Lewinsky tweeted. “Partition” is a track from the singer’s 2013 self-titled fifth studio album. In the song, Beyoncé sings that a man “Monica Lewinsky’d all on my gown.” The affair between Clinton and then-22-year-old Lewinsky ultimately led to Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 and much discussion about consent and abuse of power. In 2021, Lewinsky told CNN’s Jake Tapper that “what’s really important to remember in today’s world is that we never should have even gotten to a place where consent was a question.”  “So it was wholly inappropriate as the most powerful man, my boss, 49 years old,” she said. “I was 22, literally just out of college. And I think that the power differentials there are something that I couldn’t ever fathom consequences at 22 that I understand obviously so differently at 48.” This week, Beyoncé agreed to scrub from her track “Heated” a reference which is considered demeaning to people with spastic cerebral palsy after there was a public outcry.

460,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/new-york-police-shooting-party/,"New York City Police detectives shot and injured four men they say opened fire at a party in Queens, where around 75 to 100 people were gathered.  Around 11.35 p.m. Friday, plainclothes police from the violent crime squad were keeping watch on the party,   being held in a residential area, from an unmarked car, NYPD Chief of Patrol Jeff Maddrey said during an overnight press conference.  Police “believed that there was a potential to be violence involving some of the local street crews,” Maddrey said.  The detectives saw a group of who men arrived at the house, pulled out at least three firearms and started firing at the party. Maddrey said detectives exchanged gunfire with the group of men. Four were shot and taken to the hospital, where they were in stable condition as of Saturday morning, police told CNN.   Police said at least three firearms were recovered. None of the police officers were shot.  “There were a lot of people out here when this occurred,” Maddrey said. “They were basically firing into a crowd.”  “These details are going to illustrate how gun violence continues to beleaguer our communities, and again, I implore members of our community that it is so important to work together with your police so we can put an end to this gun violence,” Maddrey said. Police have not yet named any of the injured men or detailed what charges they may be facing.  Police said no one else was injured in the shooting.

604,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/asia/china-taiwan-pelosi-japan-tensions-intl-hnk/,"China pressed ahead with military drills near Taiwan and flew drones close to Japan on Friday, escalating tensions in the strait that have threatened to boil over since Taipei welcomed US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a historic visit. Taiwan’s defense ministry said Chinese warships and aircraft continued drills in waters around the island, adding that Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) forces crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China – in a move it called a “highly provocative act.”  The line has previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings and put air patrol forces, naval ships and shore-based missile systems on alert, the ministry added. Two Chinese drones also flew around Okinawa prefecture in Japan on Thursday, prompting the country’s Air Self-Defense Force to scramble fighter jets in response, according to a statement from Tokyo’s Ministry of Defense on Friday. In all, 49 planes entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ), Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. The ministry had previously suggested 68 aircraft flew into the area, but later clarified that 19 operated west of the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait. The moves comes as China doubles down on rhetoric blaming the US for spiking tensions and forcing it into a response. Beijing announced sanctions against Pelosi and her immediate family and said it would suspend cooperation with Washington on several issues, including fighting climate change, on Friday.  Taiwan’s Premier Su Tseng-chang said the island represented “freedom and democracy,” and that “the evil neighbor next door flexed its muscles on our doorstep and arbitrarily sabotaged (one of) the busiest waterways in the world with military exercises.” The skies and waters around Taiwan have become a focal point as Beijing ramps up tensions not only with Taiwan, but with neighboring Japan, which lodged a formal protest with China after five projectiles landed in Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The missiles were among a number launched by Beijing Thursday – some of which flew over Taiwan – as Pelosi made her way to Tokyo where she met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday. China has previously fired missiles into waters surrounding Taiwan – a democratic island of 24 million that the Chinese Communist Party regards as its territory, despite having never controlled it – most notably during the Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 1990s. But missiles flying over the island marked a significant escalation, with US officials warning there may be more to come. “We anticipated that China might take steps like this – in fact, I described them for you in quite some detail just the other day,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. “We also expect that these actions will continue and that the Chinese will continue to react in the coming days.”  A US aircraft carrier will stay in the area around Taiwan for several more days to “monitor the situation,” Kirby added.  On Friday, Kishida said the Chinese military drills were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people” and called for an immediate halt to the exercises. Japan and the US would “work together to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he added. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday, Pelosi accused China of trying “to isolate Taiwan,” pointing to the island’s exclusion from international groups like the World Health Organization.  “They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” she said.  She added that her visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo, not changing it. Later on Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it was imposing sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family for “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs (and) seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Missiles posed ‘no risk’ China started military drills around the island on Thursday, firing multiple missiles toward waters near northeastern and southwestern Taiwan the day after Pelosi’s departure. A Chinese military expert confirmed on state broadcaster CCTV that the conventional missiles flew over Taiwan’s main island, including airspace covered by Taiwanese defense missiles. “We hit the targets under the observation of US Aegis combat system, which means the Chinese military has solved the difficulties of hitting long-range targets on waters,” said Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor of strategy at the National Defense University in Beijing. In a statement late Thursday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said the missiles had traveled above the atmosphere and therefore posed no risk to the island. Authorities did not trigger air raid alerts because they predicted the missiles would land in waters east of Taiwan, the ministry said. The ministry added it would not release further information about the missiles’ trajectory to protect its intelligence-gathering capabilities. Five ballistic missiles are believed to have landed within Japan’s EEZ, including four believed to have flown over Taiwan, said Japan’s Defense Ministry on Thursday.  “This is a serious problem that concerns Japan’s security and the safety of its citizens. We strongly condemn it,” Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters during a news conference. China also sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Thursday – all of which crossed the median line. It follows similar Chinese incursions a day earlier across the median line.  Thursday’s incursions were made by 12 Su-30 fighter jets, eight J-11 fighter jets, and two J-16 fighter jets, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a statement. Later Thursday, the ministry said it detected four drones flying over “restricted waters” around the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen islands near mainland China. The ministry said Taiwan’s military fired flares to warn the drones away, but did not specify the type or origin of the devices. On Friday, a spokesperson from Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said the government’s English website and the ministry website had both detected a large number of attacks on Tuesday – the day Pelosi landed in Taiwan. The IP addresses behind the attacks came from China and Russia, among other locations, with the intention of paralyzing the government sites, said the spokesperson.  She added that the websites were back to normal after emergency repair work, but “massive attacks with malicious intent .. by overseas hostile forces” continued on Thursday and Friday.  Disruptions to trade In a speech on Thursday, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen condemned China’s military drills as “irresponsible,” saying they marked a “deliberate and continuous escalation of military threats.” “I must emphasize that, we do not seek to escalate conflicts or provoke disputes, but we will firmly defend our sovereignty and national safety, as well as safeguarding democracy and freedom,” she added. She also thanked the Group of Seven, comprised of the world’s largest economies, which released a statement on Wednesday voicing concern over China’s live-fire exercises and urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. The exercises have also caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, with some international flights canceled and vessels urged to use alternative routes for several ports around the island. On Tuesday, the Chinese Defense Ministry said it would hold its exercises in six zones around Taiwan, warning ships and aircraft to stay out of the areas during the drills. The Taiwan Strait is a key trade route for vessels carrying goods between major economies in northeast Asia such as China, Japan, and South Korea, and the rest of world.

206,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/media/economy-paul-krugman-reliable-sources/,"Even top economists are struggling to explain perhaps “the weirdest economy” Americans have ever lived through, CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said on “Reliable Sources” Sunday.  Paul Krugman, a Nobel Laureate and economist and a longtime columnist for the New York Times, said the economy is not in recession, but added that the distinction doesn’t even matter. “Jobs are abundant, although maybe the job market is weakening. Inflation is high, though maybe inflation is coming down,” Krugman said. “What does it matter whether you use the R word or not?” But in today’s divisive environment, the debate over whether or not to use the word recession by some members of the media has become “especially vitriolic,” Krugman said.  “I’ve never seen anything as bad as the determination of a lot of people to say it’s a recession,” Krugman said. “It’s above and beyond anything I’ve ever seen.” Negative news stories often get the most attention, Krugman added, but when it comes to the economy, a plurality of voters appear to not be aware of its underlying strength. “I think that what’s happening now is that there’s been a kind of a negativity bias in coverage,” Krugman said, pointing to a “media failing” when it comes to accurately covering the realities of what most Americans are experiencing in this economy.  “If you ask people how’s your financial situation, it’s pretty favorable,” Krugman said. “You ask them how’s the economy, they say, ‘Oh, it’s terrible.’” And partisanship is a large driver of that divide.  “They want their Biden recession,” Krugman said. “They’re going to have it, nevermind the fact that … there’s not a recession in any technical sense.” Krugman agreed that it is a complicated economic picture, and that a lot of the numbers aren’t consistent with each other, but that too is not surprising.  “We’re recovering from a pandemic,” Krugman said. “You’d expect a lot of things to look kind of weird right now.”   ",Brian Stelter;Paul Krugman,New York Times;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMISTS,32;MEDIA_MSM,694;ECON_INFLATION,458;ECON_INFLATION,491;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,458;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,491;WB_442_INFLATION,458;WB_442_INFLATION,491;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,139;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,694;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1213;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,139;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,694;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1213;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,139;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,694;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1213;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,97;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1295;TAX_FNCACT_CORRESPONDENT,153;GENERAL_HEALTH,1863;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1863;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1863;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1863;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1863;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1863;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1863;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1863;ELECTION,1032;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1093;WB_2670_JOBS,389;WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,389;WB_470_EDUCATION,389;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,389;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,389;TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMIST,246;TAX_FNCACT_COLUMNIST,269;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,133;USPEC_POLICY1,87;USPEC_POLICY1,311;USPEC_POLICY1,1008;USPEC_POLICY1,1328;USPEC_POLICY1,1445;EPU_ECONOMY,87;EPU_ECONOMY,311;EPU_ECONOMY,1008;EPU_ECONOMY,1328;EPU_ECONOMY,1445;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,87;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,311;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1008;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1328;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1445;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1510;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,610;",New York;Americans,442

397,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/health/love-language-improve-relationship-wellness/,"Editor’s Note: Psychologist John Duffy, author of “Parenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety,” practices in Chicago. He specializes in work with teens, parents, couples and families. Married and intimate couples are often looking for ways to maximize satisfaction and compatibility. Countless self-help books, seminars and relationship experts have weighed in on what they feel are the keys to a couple’s happiness and longevity. The ideas have varied quite a bit, including the amount of time spent together, shared interests and similar levels of intelligence, not to mention degrees of fondness and admiration for one another.  It’s often said that longtime partners develop their own language, a shorthand from building a strong bond. In the same vein, consider the five love languages, which are acts of service, gift-giving, physical touch, quality time and words of affirmation.  Thirty years ago, author, speaker and marriage counselor Gary Chapman wrote “The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate.” If you learn which language your partner favors and act in accordance with that language, the theory goes, you will find more satisfaction and longevity in your relationship. Conversely, you waste time and energy if you exert effort in other areas. This energy, Chapman argued, can even be counterproductive, as your partner may feel neither heard nor understood.  Being attuned to a partner’s love language was associated with both relationship and sexual satisfaction for heterosexual couples, found a June study published by the journal PLOS One. In particular, people who expressed their affection in the way their partner preferred to receive it experienced greater satisfaction with the relationship and were more sexually satisfied compared with those who met their partner’s needs to a lesser extent. I interviewed relationship experts on how they use this concept in their work and how it might be useful in enhancing relationship satisfaction. Do you use the 5 love languages in your work, and do you find them helpful? Bela Gandhi, founder of the Chicago-based Smart Dating Academy, uses the love languages regularly, but she pointed out there are some misunderstandings about how they are best used in relationships. She suggested that most people want all five, but their preferences vary depending on the day and the context. A continuous single preference is a myth, she said. “I find that these love languages are not absolute,” Gandhi said. “We may favor one at a point in time, but that may well vary over time as well.” Laura Berman, a love, sex and relationship therapist in Los Angeles and author of “Quantum Love: Use Your Body’s Atomic Energy to Create the Relationship You Desire,” takes a slightly different approach.  Berman finds the love languages to be a helpful jumping-off point to educate her clients. The love languages allow people to realize, she suggested, that love on its own is not enough. It needs to be acted upon in a way that makes a partner feel loved and seen.  “What I like about the love languages is that they are great prompts to talk about with your partner,” Gandhi added. “We tend to understand our own love languages. But in my work and my own relationship, people often don’t go out of their way to do the same for their partner.”  Gandhi and Berman agreed that love languages are helpful because they allow an individual or couple to gauge where they stand in a relationship. “I encourage my clients to ask themselves whether they are doing a pretty good job across all five languages,” Gandhi said, “even if one or two of them are favored by your partner.”  Is it important that couples have the same love language? “No, not at all. Love languages are as varied as can be,” Berman said via email. She indicated there are actually many more than the traditional five languages. She said she feels finding a partner with the exact same language could be impossible, but more importantly, love languages aren’t about people learning to love the exact same way as their partners. Rather, the theory of love languages is about learning that we all experience reality differently and have unique and sometimes mysterious internal lives.  The way to achieve longevity and satisfaction is not by speaking the same love language as your partner, Berman said, but honoring that your partner may experience the world differently than you and making a commitment to seek out ways to make your partner feel loved. It’s about bringing the energy you want to experience into your relationship, rather than waiting for a happy ending to be handed to you, she said.  Is it important to know and respond to your partner’s love language? Gandhi agreed that it’s important to respond to a partner’s preferred love language but also to recognize there isn’t just one playbook. One day, your partner might need quality time from you. But on their birthday, for instance, they might want a gift. They may need physical affection on another day.  And along with the five love languages, other needs may arise in relationships, including good listening skills or knowing when to provide your partner some space, either physically or emotionally.  Instead of following a love language playbook, Berman said, partners need to be curious about how to satisfy one another. Vulnerability is a necessity, so focus on learning what barriers you may have erected to prevent you from being seen or heard.  Can it be problematic not to know your partner’s love language? It’s problematic to have a relationship that isn’t built on communication, consistency and shared intentions to protect and nourish your bonds, Berman said.  “Love languages are just one resource you can use to help deepen your bond, but for many people, they just take the online love language quiz and sort of forget about it shortly thereafter. If you actually use the information to actively make choices to celebrate your love and nourish your relationship, then it can be very helpful,” she said via email.  Gandhi agreed but placed an emphasis on the utility of discussing the five languages. She suggested couples talk about the five languages and understand what each partner feels like is their most consistently important one or maybe two.  A discussion might start with, “Hey, I know quality time is really important to you. Do you feel like we’ve shared enough quality time together?”  Overall, it’s helpful for couples to talk about the love languages and make sure they’re happy with the love they’re receiving. And to maximize satisfaction and longevity, open communication around relationship needs is critical.  After all, as I know from my own practice, couples want their partner to feel loved the way they want to be loved. Talking through the love languages may not be the sole answer, but it’s a start.

582,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/donald-trump-republican-primary-midterms/,"To be or not to be, that is the question when it comes to former President Donald Trump’s potential 2024 presidential campaign.  The man who used to occupy the Oval Office has been holding rallies and endorsing candidates across the country this primary season. And this past week provided crucial tests of his influence, from Michigan down to Kansas, across to Arizona and up to Washington state.  It is with Trump’s strength within the Republican Party that we begin our weekly journey into the numbers.  Trump is still strong among Republicans Political analysts have long wondered when, or if, Trump’s grip on the Republican electorate is going to cease. There have been plenty of articles written about how his influence may very well be on the decline.  This past week, however, offered proof that Trump remains a power center within the party. It fits with other data suggesting that while the former President may not be as powerful as he once was, he remains a force to be reckoned with in the GOP.  Trump-backed candidates swept important statewide primaries in Arizona, including for governor (where Trump’s candidate defeated the one endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence), US Senate, state attorney general and secretary of state. All of them deny the fact that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election.  Likewise, in Michigan, Trump-endorsed Tudor Dixon won the Republican nomination for governor. And US Rep. Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump last year after January 6, went down to defeat in the GOP primary to another Trump-backed election denier in the 3rd Congressional District.  Trump’s pick for Kansas governor (Derek Schmidt) won his primary as well.  The former President has been quite successful this primary season in GOP contests with no incumbents or those featuring two sitting lawmakers because of redistricting. By my count, his candidates have won slightly less than 90% of contested primaries for governor or Congress that had either no incumbents or two incumbents because of redistricting.  That’s a strong number, though down from the 96% of such primaries his candidates won in the 2020 cycle. So far, the only major contest from the past week that a Trump candidate lost was in the open primary for Washington’s 4th District. GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse advanced to the general election under the state’s top two primary system, even though he had voted to impeach Trump and had to withstand a challenge from the Trump-endorsed Loren Culp, who has been in third place.  But even Newhouse’s advancement proves the point that Trump remains a power center in the GOP. As of Sunday, Newhouse was pulling in a little more than 25% of the primary vote and only 34% of those who voted for a Republican candidate in the district. That is incredibly weak for a sitting member of Congress.  Indeed, Newhouse and California’s David Valadao, the only other Republican so far who voted to impeach Trump and made it to the November ballot, have commanded about 25% of the primary vote. And both have done so in primaries where all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, ran on the same ballot with the top two vote-getters advancing to November – which means there were a lot of non-Republicans voting.   Trump’s success in primaries this season shouldn’t be all that surprising given the national polls. His very favorable rating among Republicans is in the low 50s. This is down from around 70% at the end of the 2020 campaign, but it means that a little more than half of Republicans really like Trump. There isn’t another active candidate who comes close to that level of adoration.  Speaking of candidates who aren’t Trump, few nonincumbents have ever polled at or above where Trump is currently in early national presidential primary polls – he’s at about 50% of the national primary vote.  The non-Trump candidates to have done so in the modern primary era appear to be Democrats Al Gore, in 1998, and Hillary Clinton, in 2014. Both went on to win their party’s nomination in the next presidential election.  The closest Republicans were George H.W. Bush in 1986 and George W. Bush in 1998. Both were polling in the low 40s and would go on to win the GOP nomination.  While it is true Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been gaining on Trump nationally, he’s still about 25 points behind him.  Perhaps the best way to understand Trump’s standing in the GOP is to look at the verbs “could” and “will”. Trump could be beat if he decides to run for the Republican nomination. He will, however, be tough to beat.  A hazy picture three months before Election Day Before we get ahead of ourselves with all this 2024 talk, there’s a big election to be held this year! The 2022 midterms are only about three months away, and the picture has become more uncertain as we approach the date.  Normally, midterms follow a simple pattern. The White House party loses seats in Congress (especially the House). This is especially the case when the incumbent president has an approval rating below 50%. Biden’s approval rating is below 40%.  Yet, the generic congressional ballot keeps getting tighter. The 3-point lead Republicans held in May has completely disappeared by now. (The generic ballot usually asks respondents some form of the following question: “If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican party?”)  This is unusual. Often, the challenging party improves its position on the generic ballot over the course of the midterm cycle.  The haziness in the national environment can be tied to what voters feel are the important issues of the day. Yes, the economy is the No. 1 issue. And yes, inflation remains historically high. This has led to a decline in real disposable income per capita (i.e., the money Americans have to spend).  Yet, there are facets of the economy that are quite good or at least improving. We are tied for the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. The stock market is up. Gas prices are down from their June peak.  Moreover, there are other issues besides the economy at play. Abortion may not rank as high on the list of voter priorities as the economy, but more Americans than at any point since at least 1984 say it is a top problem. We saw this past week that abortion can motivate voters. Democrats saw a massive increase in voter turnout in Kansas compared with every other primary so far this season.  Answering the question of who will control Congress next year has become muddled in another way as well: The House and the Senate may be controlled by different parties.  Democrats will likely lose the House, even as the national picture for them improves. They just have too much exposure.  Democrats, though, are no more than a slight underdog in their effort to retain Senate control. We’ve seen good recent polling for them in battleground states such Georgia and Pennsylvania. Those same polls reveal that Republicans have had a problem nominating candidates who aren’t well liked.  The bottom line is people who are into elections are in for an exciting final three months of the 2022 campaign.  For your brief encounters: Football has begun America’s No. 1 sport got underway Thursday, with the first preseason game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Las Vegas Raiders broadcast nationally on NBC.  And despite it being a completely meaningless affair, more than 5 million people tuned in. That is a small audience given how many people watch regular season games. But in a sign of how strong a brand the NFL is, the game was by far the highest rated show of the night.  Just remember: The preseason doesn’t matter. The last two teams to lose every single regular season game in a season won every game that preseason.  Leftover data Drinkers and nondrinkers actually agree: A new Gallup poll shows that 75% of Americans believe that alcohol has a negative effect on society. This includes 85% of drinkers and 71% of nondrinkers.  Owning an electric car: While 67% of Americans favor providing incentives to increase the use of hybrid and electric vehicles, only 42% say they are at least somewhat likely to purchase one the next time they buy a vehicle, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Just 16% were very likely.  Winter is coming: As the heat rages on in much of the continental United States, winter storm warnings have been active in Alaska this weekend. It’s a sign that summer can’t last all year round. After all, we’ve lost over 20 minutes of sunlight at the end of the day in New York City over the past few months.",Donald Trump;Tudor Dixon;Peter Meijer;David Valadao;Joe Biden;Ron Desantis;Al Gore;Derek Schmidt;Loren Culp;Mike Pence;Hillary Clinton;Dan Newhouse,Pew Research Center;Republican Party;Republican Party;White House;Us Senate;Oval Office;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States,"ELECTION,1344;ELECTION,1582;ELECTION,2346;ELECTION,4027;ELECTION,4547;ELECTION,4630;",Pennsylvania;White House;Kansas;Americans;United States;Alaska;America;Arizona;Georgia;Michigan;New York;Jacksonville;Washington;Las Vegas;California;Florida,1811

4,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/veteran-burn-pits-what-matters/,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The recipe for a good old-fashioned Washington cluster is all here: What are burn pits? How have they caused cancer in veterans? Read this from CNN’s Paul LeBlanc.  In short: “Burn pits were used to incinerate all sorts of waste, hazardous material and chemical compounds at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. Eighty-six percent of post-9/11 veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan say they were exposed to burn pits, according to a 2020 survey by the nonprofit Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.” What’s Toomey’s gripe? It’s an accounting dispute  The GOP’s ringleader obstructing passage of the burn pits legislation is Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a budget hawk who is retiring from the Senate and so is no longer facing voters. His problem is the versions of the bill considered earlier this year assumed money for the burn pits care would be appropriated in the regular appropriations process each year by the Senate. The version senators are currently considering would make the fund essentially permanent and place it in the category of “mandatory” spending, meaning it’s guaranteed forever, but also could create some coveted space in the discretionary budget.  Toomey’s specific concern is Section 805 of a very long bill text. With the title “Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund,” the language makes clear that, “No amount appropriated to the Fund in fiscal year 2023 or any subsequent fiscal year pursuant to this section shall be counted as discretionary budget authority and outlays or as direct spending …” Toomey is unapologetic for opposing this tweak and standing in the way of the bill.  He explained his position on “State of the Union” on Sunday, in a long conversation with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “We are spending way too much money, to use – to hide behind a veterans bill the opportunity to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending spree is wrong,” Toomey said. He worries that by switching the burn pits fund from discretionary to mandatory spending, it would free up $400 billion in space on the discretionary spending books that lawmakers will use for something else. “Now when you create that big hole, guess what happens to that big hole,” Toomey said on the Senate floor last month. “It gets filled with spending on who knows what. That’s what’s going on here.” It may be a valid gripe, but a bill to help veterans sickened by burn pits while they were at war is an awkward place to make a stand.  It’s even more awkward since 25 Republicans who voted for a previous version of the bill are now standing in its way. What do veterans say? Veterans protesting around the clock on Capitol Hill argue any wait is too long. They want the bill passed now. And they’re worried that if the spending isn’t made part of the mandatory budget, it could be taken away in the future. Matt Zeller, a major in the US Army Reserves and an adviser to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN from Capitol Hill that his activist group knows of veterans in despair today. “When people get sick from these cancers, they’re having to mortgage their homes just to be able to stay alive,” he said. “You know, people think that this is covered by the VA – it’s not. And this bill would fix that for over 3.5 million of us who are exposed to burn pits.” What’s the answer to Toomey’s complaint? Supporters of the bill say Toomey is seeing a mirage. “If you look in the bill for $400 billion that he’s talking about, you won’t see it,” Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough told Tapper after Toomey’s appearance. McDonough said Toomey’s approach would put an annual cap on how much could go into the fund, potentially end the fund after 10 years and even possibly require care to be withheld from veterans seeking care after exposure to burn pits. “If his estimations are wrong about what we will spend in any given year, that means that we may have to ration care for veterans,” McDonough said of Toomey. What’s the subtext here? Republicans feel played that Democrats are on the cusp of using reconciliation – a very different budget gimmick both sides have used in recent years – to pass health care and climate legislation.  The deal among Democrats for the health and climate legislation was hatched at the last minute with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. It was announced just after Republicans helped pass a bipartisan bill to prop up a US semiconductor industry. Lawmakers of all stripes want to wrap up their work and get out on the campaign trail for the rest of August since the November midterm election is fast approaching. Possible ways out Republicans could buckle to public pressure to allow a vote on the measure, which has plenty of support to pass. Democrats could buckle to Republican pressure to allow consideration of amendments and potentially changing budget language in the bill. Or, neither side buckles and the burn pits legislation dies.  Both sides want to pass the bill, ultimately. Republicans probably won’t mind if it takes a bit longer and further complicates Democrats’ other priorities.",Pat Toomey;Joe Manchin;Paul Leblanc;Jake Tapper;Matt Zeller;Denis Mcdonough,Union On;Senate Republicans;Veterans Affairs;Us Army;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cost Of War Toxic Exposures Fund,"EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,344;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,493;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,370;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,3169;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,4678;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5048;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5317;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICANS,5678;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,370;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3169;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4678;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5048;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5317;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5678;ELECTION,765;ELECTION,5263;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,232;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,552;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,833;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,1057;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,1196;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,2490;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3043;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3262;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3278;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3605;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3702;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,4181;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,4437;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,4611;USPEC_POLICY1,409;USPEC_POLICY1,1369;USPEC_POLICY1,1873;USPEC_POLICY1,2170;USPEC_POLICY1,3473;USPEC_POLICY1,4777;USPEC_POLICY1,5534;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,409;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,1369;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,1873;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,2170;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,3473;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,4777;EPU_POLICY_BUDGET,5534;",Pennsylvania;Capitol Hill;West Virginia;America;Washington;Afghanistan;Iraq,1088
615,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/05/asia/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-tokyo-intl-hnk/,"China’s Foreign Ministry announced new countermeasures against Washington on Friday, including the suspension of climate talks, in response to Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, hours after it announced sanctions against the US House speaker.  The measures include the cancellation of future phone calls and meetings between Chinese and US defense leaders, for which future dates had not been announced, and the cancellation of annual naval meetings under the China-US military maritime consultation mechanism. China also suspended cooperation on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, legal assistance on criminal matters and the combat of transnational crimes, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a briefing Friday.  It suspended its anti-drug cooperation with the US, which has already been strained in recent years. The US has blamed China for failing to stop synthetic opioids reaching the US as both Beijing and Washington disagree on how to counteract the problem.

The moves come after Beijing announced that it would sanction Pelosi and her immediate family over the visit to Taiwan, and as it stepped up military drills and warplane incursions around the island. Earlier Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry condemned Pelosi for what it described as her “vicious and provocative actions,” saying her trip to Taiwan amounted to “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs.”  “U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted on visiting Taiwan in disregard of China’s serious concerns and firm opposition, seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs, seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampling on the one-China principle, and seriously threatening the peace and stability across Taiwan Strait,” a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday.  “In response to Pelosi’s vicious and provocative actions, China has decided to impose sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family,” the statement said. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan on Wednesday, when she met President Tsai Ing-wen and other leaders, has infuriated China’s Communist Party, which views the self-governed democratic island as its territory – despite never having controlled it.  At a news conference in Tokyo during the last stop of her Asia tour, Pelosi struck a defiant tone, saying China had sought to isolate Taiwan from the international community but would not prevent US officials from traveling there. “We will not allow (China) to isolate Taiwan,” the California Democrat said Friday. “They are not doing our travel schedule.” The White House summoned the Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, on Thursday to condemn China’s “irresponsible” military activities following Pelosi’s trip, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post.    Ahead of the visit, Beijing had warned it would take “forceful measures” if Pelosi went ahead, and on her departure it launched live-fire military exercises and sent missiles over Taiwan for the first time.   Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said as of 11 a.m. Friday, several Chinese military jets and warships had conducted exercises around the Taiwan Strait and crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings, air patrol forces, naval ships, and shore-based missile systems, the ministry said. On Thursday, China sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), all of them crossing the median line.  A number of countries, including from the G7 grouping of some of the world’s largest economies, have criticized China’s drills, urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. In her comments on Friday, Pelosi said the visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo. “It’s about the Taiwan Relations Act, the US-China policy, all of the pieces of legislation and agreements that have established what our relationship is – to have peace in the Taiwan Strait and to have the status quo prevail,” she said. Pelosi also rejected suggestions by some critics that her visit had more to do with burnishing her legacy than benefiting the island, calling the claim “ridiculous.”  She pointed to Taiwan’s “free and open democracy,” successful economy and relatively progressive LGBTQ rights. “This isn’t about me – it’s about them,” she added. “It’s about Taiwan, and I am proud to have worked over the years to showcase the concerns that they have with mainland China.” Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday called for an immediate halt to China’s drills, saying they were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people.”  Earlier, Japan lodged a formal complaint after five Chinese missiles landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone. Amid worsening relations, China canceled a planned meeting between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers. On Thursday, China’s Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li summoned envoys to China from European countries, the EU and Japan in protest of their statements regarding Taiwan. The G7 statement “distorts the facts” and is a “blatant political provocation,” said Deng, who accused the countries involved of interfering with China’s internal affairs. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan was the first by a sitting House speaker in 25 years, since then-House Speaker Speaker Newt Gingrich’s visit in 1997. Her Asia tour also included stops in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.

Alina Fernández, daughter of the former Cuban dictator who died in 2016, has told Deadline she supports Franco playing her father in the forthcoming independent film “Alina of Cuba.” “James Franco has an obvious physical resemblance with Fidel Castro, besides his skills and charisma,” she told the publication.  There had been public outcry from some over Franco’s casting, including from actor John Leguizamo, because the actor is not Latino. “How is this still going on? How is Hollywood excluding us but stealing our narratives as well?” Leguizamo posted on his verified Instagram account. “No more appropriation Hollywood and streamers! Boycott! This F’d up!,” he wrote. “Plus seriously difficult story to tell without aggrandizement which would b wrong! I don’t got a prob with Franco but he ain’t Latino!”  The film tells the story of Fernández, who was born as the result of a love affair between Cuban-born socialite Natalia “Naty” Revuelta and Castro.  “I’m sure that Mía Maestro, an actress I admire, will understand and interpret Naty, my mother, in a unique way and I can’t wait to see her building her character,” Fernández told Deadline.  “The project is almost entirely Latino, both in front and behind the camera,” she added.",Alina Fern;Natalia Naty Revuelta;James Franco;James Franco;John Leguizamo;Fidel Castro;Fidel Castro,Instagram;Cnn,"WB_1467_EDUCATION_FOR_ALL,335;WB_470_EDUCATION,335;WB_2131_EMPLOYABILITY_SKILLS_AND_JOBS,335;WB_1484_EDUCATION_SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT_AND_LABOR_MARKET,335;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1211;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,455;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,490;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,195;KILL,131;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,131;TAX_FNCACT_SOCIALITE,1025;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,1103;TAX_FNCACT_DICTATOR,122;SLFID_DICTATORSHIP,122;",Hollywood;Cuban;Cuba,290
98,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/asia/pelosi-visits-hawaii-as-she-heads-on-asia-tour-hnk-intl/,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is heading to Asia for a tour of the region after landing in Hawaii, where she visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial and the USS Arizona. Pelosi is leading a Congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific and plans to visit places including Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, according to a statement released by her office on Sunday. The statement made no mention of Taiwan, despite speculation in recent days that Pelosi might be planning to visit the self-governing democracy of 24 million people. China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory – despite never having controlled it – has warned against Pelosi visiting the island, and US President Joe Biden recently let slip that the US military thinks such a trip would be “not a good idea right now”. However, US lawmakers on both sides of Washington’s political divide have urged her to go. “Today, our Congressional delegation travels to the Indo-Pacific to reaffirm America’s strong and unshakeable commitment to our allies and friends in the region,” Pelosi said in the statement released by her office.  She said high level meetings will be held in each country to “further advance our shared interests and values, including peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance.” Pelosi said the delegation had received a briefing from United States Indo-Pacific Command leadership after a fuel stop in Hawaii, where they visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial and the USS Arizona. Traveling alongside Pelosi as part of the Congressional delegation are Chairman Gregory Meeks (Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Chairman Mark Takano (Chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs), Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Congressman Andy Kim. “Under the strong leadership of President Biden, America is firmly committed to smart, strategic engagement in the region, understanding that a free and flourishing Indo-Pacific is crucial to prosperity in our nation and around the globe,” Pelosi said.",Raja Krishnamoorthi;Gregory Meeks;Suzan Delbene;Andy Kim;Mark Takano;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden,China Communist Party;House Committee On Veteran Affairs;House Foreign Affairs Committee,"TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2029;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2065;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,227;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,968;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1831;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,227;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,968;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,1831;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,911;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1529;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,858;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,858;TAX_FNCACT_VETERAN,1977;EPU_ECONOMY,1461;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1461;GENERAL_HEALTH,1500;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1500;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1500;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1500;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1500;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1500;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1500;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1500;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,579;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1514;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1491;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSWOMAN,2001;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1855;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1925;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,585;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1536;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1536;DEMOCRACY,541;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,541;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,30;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1521;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1560;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1560;LEADER,730;LEADER,2118;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,730;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2118;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,1468;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,1521;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,1521;",Japan;Hawaii;Taiwan;Hong Kong;Singapore;United States;Arizona;America;Washington;Malaysia;South Korea;Pearl Harbor;China,402
573,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/biden-mar-a-lago-fbi/,"The White House on Tuesday largely declined to answer questions on the FBI’s search of former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, instead emphasizing President Joe Biden’s belief in the independence of the Justice Department. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during a briefing on Tuesday that Biden was not briefed ahead of the search taking place at Mar-a-Lago and neither Biden nor any other official inside the White House was made aware of the operation ahead of time. “No, the President was not briefed, was not aware of it. No one in the White House was given a heads up,” Jean-Pierre told reporters, later adding, “We learned about this just like the American people did.”  Jean-Pierre said Biden and White House officials learned about the the FBI executing a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago – Trump’s Florida resort – from public reports when the news broke on Monday. Three people familiar with the situation have told CNN that the search was made as part of an investigation into the handling of presidential documents, including classified documents, that may have been brought there.  The National Archives had previously said at least 15 boxes of White House records, including records that contained classified material, were recovered from Mar-a-Lago. The search began early Monday morning and was focused on the areas where Trump’s offices and personal quarters are, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that the Justice Department conducts investigations independently, and the White House leaves law enforcement matters to them. She declined to say whether the White House is aware whether Attorney General Merrick Garland personally signed off on the search.  She added that it “would not be appropriate” for the White House to comment on ongoing criminal investigations. Biden, Jean-Pierre said, believes in the rule of law and the independence of Justice Department investigations.  US Secret Service were in contact with the FBI ahead of the search, a person familiar with the matter said.  In a statement confirming the search at his Palm Beach property, Trump said FBI agents “even broke into my safe” during the operation.  “My beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said Monday evening. The former President was at Trump Tower in New York when the search warrant was executed in Florida, a person familiar told CNN. Trump is expected to announce his 2024 White House bid in the coming months, even as his legal problems are mounting on multiple fronts – including two known active Justice Department investigations.  Republicans have rushed to Trump’s defense following the search, with many calling on the FBI to explain the reasoning behind the operation.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy alleged that the Department of Justice “has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.”  McCarthy in a tweet told Garland to “preserve your documents and clear your calendar,” warning of an oversight probe “when” Republicans take back the chamber in the midterm elections this November.

406,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/media/alex-jones-punitive-damages-sandy-hook/,"A Texas jury has decided to penalize Alex Jones with $45.2 million in punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victim Jesse Lewis. Plaintiffs Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis were awarded a total of just under $50 million in both compensatory and punitive damages. Of the total $49.3 million, the $45.2 million in punitive damages may be reduced due to Texas statute. “Care and concern is so important and we saw what happens when there is a dearth of that, and so I hope that we all just go home tonight and everybody that’s reading these articles and hearing this message and you chose love with your kids, because you can,” Lewis said Friday after learning of the jury’s decision. “That means being present in the moment with them, looking into their eyes, giving them a hug and just moving from there. Just every moment, realize that you have a choice and your choice is love.” The jurors began deliberating around 12:30 pm CT on Friday, after Judge Maya Guerra Gamble reminded them that in a default judgment against him Jones was already found liable for defamation and “intentional infliction of emotional distress” against Lewis and Heslin. In an emotional closing argument Friday, Lewis and Heslin’s attorney Wesley Todd Ball had said to the jury, “We ask that you send a very very simple message, and that is, stop Alex Jones. Stop the monetization of misinformation and lies. Please.” After the jury’s decision was announced in court, Jones’ attorney, Andino Reynal, immediately raised the issue of Texas law and the amount of punitive damages. Following the proceeding, he addressed it again while speaking outside the court. “We think the verdict was too high. As for punitive damages, Texas law caps them at $750,000 per plaintiff so this verdict today amounts to $1.5 million in punitives. Alex Jones will be on the air today, he’ll be on the air tomorrow, he’ll be on the air next week. He’s going to keep doing his job holding the power structure accountable. That’s our only statement,” Reynal said after court. Judge Gamble acknowledged Reynal’s objection in court but did not immediately rule on it. “So we do have laws in Texas where we claim to trust our juries and then we don’t trust our juries, and that’s true,” Gamble said at the time. “And I’m sure the judgment will properly reflect that laws of Texas in that regard, so don’t need to worry about that.”  CNN has reached out to an attorney for the plaintiffs for comment on Reynal’s argument. During closing arguments, Ball had urged the jurors to “deter Alex Jones from ever doing this awfulness again” and “to deter others who may want to step into his shoes.” Reynal had argued for a far lower sum, suggesting that the jurors should multiply Jones’ purported earnings per hour of $14,000 and the 18 hours that he said Jones talked about Sandy Hook on Infowars, for a sum of around a quarter million dollars.  On Thursday, in the first phase of the trial, the jury awarded the parents $4.1 million in compensatory damages, a far smaller amount than the $150 million the parents’ attorneys had sought. In his closing argument, Ball thanked the jury for their decision to award the $4.1 million, saying it had already made a huge difference in the parents’ lives, and asked them to award enough in punitive damages to bring the total to $150 million.  Punitive damages are a form of punishment for a defendant’s behavior. Jones, the head of the conspiratorial media outlet Infowars, repeatedly lied about the Sandy Hook massacre. He stoked conspiracy theories about the victims and their families, prompting multiple defamation lawsuits. He has since acknowledged that the mass shooting occurred. Jones claimed in his testimony that a jury award of just $2 million would destroy him financially. But on Friday morning the jurors heard testimony about Jones’ wealth from an economist, Bernard Pettingill, Jr., who estimated Jones has a net worth of between $135 million and $270 million. Pettingill, Jr., who examined several years of records for Jones and Infowars’ parent Free Speech Systems, said Jones used a series of shell companies to hide his money. Jones used two large loans to make it appear he was broke when in fact he was not, Pettingill, Jr. testified.  “Alex Jones knows where the money is, he knows where that money went and he knows that he is going to eventually benefit by that money,” Pettingill, Jr. said. After one of the jurors asked about the difference between Jones’ money and his company’s money, Pettingill, Jr. said “you cannot separate Alex Jones from the companies. He is the companies.” Jones “monetized his shtick,” he added, even suggesting that Jones could teach a college course about his techniques.  Jones’ fear-mongering rants on Infowars have, for many years, been paired with ads for supplements, documentaries, and other products Infowars sells. Pettingill, Jr. said the money poured in, identifying nine different companies that are owned by Jones.  “He is a very successful man, he promulgated some hate speech and some misinformation, but he made a lot of money and he monetized that,” Pettingill, Jr. said on the stand. “My thinking about him is he didn’t ride a wave, he created the wave.” Jones testified earlier in the week about his alleged financial troubles after social media giants like Facebook and Twitter banned his content from their platforms.  “I remember him saying that, but the records don’t reflect that,” Pettingill, Jr said. During closing arguments, Ball asserted that Jones has even more money hidden away in other places and argued that $4.1 million was a drop in Jones’ proverbial bucket. “He’s probably already made it back in donations” from fans, Ball said.

502,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/bidens-kentucky-trip/,"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are scheduled to travel to Kentucky on Monday after deadly floods in the eastern part of the state killed more than three dozen people and destroyed communities.  The Bidens will join Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and the state’s first lady, Britainy Beshear, in visiting families affected by the flooding. They will survey recovery efforts at a local Federal Emergency Management Agency State Disaster Recovery Center, according to the White House.  At least 37 people are dead after heavy rains led to widespread flooding last week. Rescue workers continue to search for those who are missing. The flooding has destroyed communities, swept away entire homes and displaced thousands of Kentuckians. It has also knocked out essential power and water utilities, some of which has yet to be restored.  Many remain stranded without access to clean water, electricity and critical supplies. The governor has said heavily damaged infrastructure has made some communities nearly impossible to access, and the high temperature and humidity are also posing a challenge.  The trip announcement comes as the President continues to isolate at the White House as he is still testing positive for Covid-19.  Biden has tested positive every day since Saturday, when he first tested positive for his rebound case of the virus. The President’s doctor has been providing daily updates on his condition and said Friday that Biden “continues to feel very well” and that his cough “has almost completely resolved.”  The President is experiencing a rebound case of the virus after first testing positive for Covid-19 on July 21 and completing a five-day course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. The White House has several in-person events planned for next week, which are expected to only take place as planned if the President tests negative for Covid-19 and emerges from isolation.   Biden, 79, is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19 due to his age, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization and death for older adults.

47,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/capitol-police-trump-mehta/,"A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a motion from Donald Trump to dismiss three lawsuits brought by four police officers against the former president for their injuries suffered during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The two-paragraph order from DC District Judge Amit Mehta rejects Trump’s claim that he has immunity from these lawsuits because his actions fell within his presidential duties. US Capitol Police officers Briana Kirkland and Marcus Moore, along with Washington, DC Metropolitan Police officers DeDivine K. Carter and Bobby Tabron, allege Trump is responsible for the Capitol attack. Tuesday, Mehta cited his ruling from February in a similar case involving Capitol Police officers suing Trump for their injuries where he sided with the officers. “The court already rejected President Trump’s assertion of immunity,” Mehta said in the brief order. “The court does so again.” In the previous order, Mehta wrote that Trump’s alleged actions did not fall into the “outer perimeter” of official presidential responsibilities because they were “entirely concern[ed] with his efforts to remain in office for a second term.”",Amit Mehta;Donald Trump;Bobby Tabron;Briana Kirkland;Marcus Moore,Capitol Police;Capitol Police;Us Capitol Police;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Dc Metropolitan Police,"TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,118;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,419;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,523;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,874;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICERS,938;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1255;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,20;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,261;TRIAL,89;TRIAL,333;LEADER,147;LEADER,978;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,147;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,978;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,147;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,978;SECURITY_SERVICES,109;SECURITY_SERVICES,410;SECURITY_SERVICES,514;SECURITY_SERVICES,865;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,109;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,410;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,514;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,865;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,109;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,410;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,514;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,865;WB_1428_INJURY,166;WB_1428_INJURY,905;WB_1406_DISEASES,166;WB_1406_DISEASES,905;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,166;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,905;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,166;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,905;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,166;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,905;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,166;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,905;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,693;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,773;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1190;",Washington,221
32,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/business/nightcap-gig-economy/,"This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here. Neither inflation nor a global pandemic can stop the gig economy, it seems.   In fact, we’re Uber-ing and Airbnb-ing more than ever in 2022, defying predictions that the sharing economy would collapse in the era of Covid.   Here’s the deal: It’s the summer of sharing … and side hustling. Got a thing that you own? There’s probably a market for people who’ll pay to borrow it. Your house, car, your boat, even your swimming pool can become a lucrative asset if you’re willing to rent it out. And it seems supply and demand are both going strong:   At this point, Uber and Airbnb are the old guard of the gig economy – disruptors who’ve become establishment and inspired a whole new class of sharing-minded startups that have flourished in the Covid era.   A couple of forces are buoying (pun intended) those businesses, and neither are particularly uplifting:   (Side note: A bit surprisingly, Julia reports, all this Uber-ing and going out to eat and renting vacay homes isn’t translating to a rebound for dating apps. The CEO of Match Group, which owns Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, said that “while people have generally moved past lockdowns and entered a more normal way of life, their willingness to try online dating products for the first time hasn’t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.”) BOTTOM LINE: The gig economy emerged as much out of necessity as it did desire. Not to beat a dead horse but, um, Millennials got pretty well screwed out of the Homeownership Dream, let alone the Second Homeownership Dream or the Let’s Get a Boat Dream. As a result, we don’t value ownership the same way our parents did. We share because that’s how we’ve gotten by. Dare I say we’re a less entitled generation as a result…  The pandemic may have taken the heat off the gig economy (figuratively, anyway), but as we emerge with our vaccines to mingle once more and distract ourselves from the world falling apart, sharing is caring.   NUMBER OF THE DAY: 100,000 The world’s oil-exporting countries agreed to a teeny-tiny increase in output next month of about 100,000 barrels a day. That’s a largely symbolic gesture — a nod from Saudi Arabia to President Joe Biden, who’s been pleading with OPEC to pump more oil and help bring down prices. The Saudi’s basically just said OK, Joe, here’s your thimble of oil, now run along.   Key quote: “That is so little as to be meaningless,” one Eurasia Group analyst told Reuters. “As a political gesture, it is almost insulting.”   THEY’RE BAAAAACK… Yesterday, an obscure Hong Kong-based company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange saw its shares rise 126% in a single day. Not bad…   But for a company that IPO’d less than three weeks ago, it was just the latest in a dizzying stock surge that even its executives couldn’t explain.   In less than a month, shares of AMTD Digital have shot up around 21,000%, from $7.80 apiece to $1,679. If you’re feeling some déjà vu, you’re not alone…  Here’s the deal: The Reddit army is back in action, it seems.   AMTD Digital is a firm you’ve almost certainly never heard of. The company is an arm of AMTD Idea Group, an investment bank based in Hong Kong that is also listed in New York and Singapore. The unit was founded in 2019, and provides fintech services in Asia, including a virtual bank called Airstar.  With all due respect to AMTD, it’s borrrrrring.   And yet this little-known fintech firm, which brought in just over $25 million in revenue last year, now boasts a market cap of more than $310 billion.  That’s more valuable than Shell or Costco. It’s on par with companies like Walmart and ExxonMobil, my colleague Michelle Toh reports.   Just to underscore the absurdity of this whole thing, the company released a statement basically shrugging that their extreme turn of fortune.   “To our knowledge, there are no material circumstances, events nor other matters relating to our company’s business and operating activities since the IPO date.”   LOL.   The source, it seems, is a bunch of traders on the famous (or notorious, depending on your perspective) WallStreetBets subreddit that executed a hedge-fund-destroying short squeeze in early 2021 when it piled into GameStop, AMC and other stocks they believed were undervalued.    Speculation is firmly on the Reddit crowd, but even some of those investors appeared befuddled by the surge.   According to Bloomberg, some analysts are pointing to the AMTD’s low free float, which makes it easier for big shareholders to push up the price.   “Given the speed of its ascent, I have a feeling this one will nosedive,” Oktay Kavrak, director at Leverage Shares told Bloomberg. “I hope investors take profits along the way as the inevitable crash will send HKD back to relative obscurity.”  Enjoying Nightcap?

200,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/world/asteroid-bennu-surface-ball-pit-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A near-Earth asteroid named Bennu has turned out to be full of surprises – the latest of which is the fact that it has a surface similar to a pit of plastic balls, according to NASA scientists.  The new revelation comes after the space agency successfully collected a sample from the asteroid in October 2020.  During the historic collection event, the sampling head of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft sank 1.6 feet (0.5 meter) into the surface of the asteroid. Apparently, Bennu’s exterior is made of loosely packed particles that aren’t bound together very securely, based on what happened as the spacecraft collected a sample. If the spacecraft hadn’t fired its thruster to back away after its quick collection of dust and rocks, it might have sunk right into the asteroid. “By the time we fired our thrusters to leave the surface we were still plunging into the asteroid,” said Ron Ballouz, an OSIRIS-REx scientist based at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, in a statement. Ballouz is a coauthor of a pair of July studies released in the journals Science and Science Advances about the discovery. Bennu is a rubble-pile asteroid shaped like a spinning top, composed of rocks bound together by gravity. It’s about one-third of a mile (500 meters) wide. “If Bennu was completely packed, that would imply nearly solid rock, but we found a lot of void space in the surface,” said study coauthor Kevin Walsh, a member of the OSIRIS-REx science team from Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, in a statement. So what might have happened if the spacecraft’s thrusters didn’t fire right away? “It may be that OSIRIS-REx would have gone deeper inside the asteroid, which is both fascinating and scary,” said study coauthor Patrick Michel, an OSIRIS-REx scientist and director of research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique at Côte d’Azur Observatory in Nice, France. Fortunately, the spacecraft and its prized sample are heading back to Earth. The Bennu sample is due to land in September 2023. Bennu defies expectations When the spacecraft arrived at Bennu in December 2018, the OSIRIS-Rex team was surprised to find that the asteroid’s surface was covered with boulders. Previous observations had prepared them for a sandy, beachlike terrain. The scientists also witnessed particles from the asteroid releasing into space.  “Our expectations about the asteroid’s surface were completely wrong,” said study author Dante Lauretta, principal investigator of OSIRIS-REx at the University of Arizona, Tucson, in a statement. The spacecraft captured images of the site where it collected a sample from Bennu, which further baffled the team. Although OSIRIS-REx very gently tapped the asteroid, it kicked up a massive amount of rocky debris and left a crater 26 feet (8 meters) wide. “What we saw was a huge wall of debris radiating out from the sample site,” said Lauretta, a regents professor of planetary science and Cosmochemistry at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “We were like, ‘Holy cow!’ Every time we tested the sample pickup procedure in the lab, we barely made a divot.” Before and after photos of the touchdown site show the dramatic difference. The images reveal what looks like a depression in the surface, with several large boulders at its base. The sampling event itself likely caused this sunken landform. The dark surface of the asteroid also has more reflective dust near the collection point, showing where rocks were moved during the event. These changes are evident in the slider below.  When analyzing the spacecraft’s acceleration data, the team determined that it encountered very little resistance, about the same amount someone might feel pushing the plunger on a French press coffee maker.  Understanding more about Bennu’s composition can help scientists studying other asteroids, whether the goal is to plan missions like OSIRIS-REx or protect Earth from potential collisions with space rocks. An asteroid like Bennu, barely holding itself together, could break apart in Earth’s atmosphere, which might pose other risks even if it’s not a direct hit. “We need to keep interacting physically with those bodies because this is the only way to really determine their mechanical properties and response to external actions,” Michel said. “Images are crucial but do not give us the answer of whether they are weak or strong.” OSIRIS-REx – which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer – was the first NASA mission sent to a near-Earth asteroid, and once there it performed the closest orbit of a planetary body by a spacecraft to date. Bennu is the smallest object ever orbited by a spacecraft. The spacecraft’s souvenir from Bennu is the largest sample collected by a NASA mission since lunar rocks were brought back by Apollo astronauts.  Once OSIRIS-REx approaches Earth in 2023, it will jettison the capsule containing the sample, which will shoot through Earth’s atmosphere and parachute down in the Utah desert.  If OSIRIS-REx is still in good health after it drops off the sample, it will then start on a new expedition to study other asteroids.

134,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/blinken-npt-remarks/,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday called on Russia to live up to its nuclear arms control commitments, accusing Moscow of “reckless, dangerous nuclear saber rattling” as part of its war in Ukraine and warning of the negative impact the war will have on this month’s conference to recommit to the importance of nuclear non-proliferation. In remarks at the start of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference at the United Nations, the top US diplomat warned that the landmark agreement is “under increasing strain” due to not only the actions of Russia, but also of North Korea and Iran. Officials have acknowledged the challenges that Russia’s war in Ukraine will present at the review conference – which is typically held every five years but had been delayed for two due to the coronavirus pandemic – and the prospects of all parties agreeing to a consensus document at the conclusion of the month-long gathering.  In his remarks, Blinken noted that Russia had joined with the other NPT nuclear states – the United States, United Kingdom, France, and China – in a joint statement in January emphasizing the importance of avoiding nuclear war and arms races, but “the very next month, Russia launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine.” “It’s engaging in reckless, dangerous nuclear saber rattling, with its president warning that those supporting Ukraine self-defense ‘risk consequences such as you have never seen in your entire history,’” Blinken said. Earlier on Monday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning about the importance of the meeting. “Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” Guterres said. “We need the treaty on non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as much as ever. That’s why this Review Conference is so important. It’s an opportunity to hammer-out the measures that will help avoid certain disaster.” Unlike in January, only three of the NPT nuclear states – the US, UK, and France – released a joint statement Monday at the start of the conference, in which they called on Russia “to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour, to uphold its international commitments, and to recommit – in words and deeds – to the principles enshrined in the recent Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races Leaders’ statement,” referencing the one released in January. Blinken said Russia’s war is in violation of the UN Charter, the rules-based international order, and the Budapest Memorandum – the 1994 agreement under which Russia pledged to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and Kyiv agreed to forfeit its nuclear weapon arsenal. “What message does this send to any country around the world that may think that it needs to have nuclear weapons to protect, to defend, to deter aggression against its sovereignty and independence? The worst possible message,” he said. “And so it’s directly relevant to what’s going on here this month at the United Nations.” “Most recently, we saw Russia’s aggression with its seizure of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest such plant in all of Europe,” Blinken continued. “Russia is now using the plant as a military base to fire at Ukrainians, knowing that they can’t and won’t shoot back because they might accidentally strike a reactor or highly radioactive waste in storage.” “That brings the notion of having a human shield to an entirely different and horrific level,” he said. Blinken contrasted the actions by Moscow to those of the US, which he said has sought to avoid escalation “by forgoing previously scheduled ICBM tests and not raising the alert status of our nuclear forces in response to Russian saber rattling.” “There is no place in our world, no place in our world for nuclear deterrence based on coercion, intimidation, or blackmail,” he said. Blinken also called out North Korea for its nuclear provocations, noting that “as we gather today, Pyongyang is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test.” The top US diplomat said “Iran remains on a path of nuclear escalation.” “Although it publicly claims to favor return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, since March Iran has been either unwilling or unable to accept the deal to achieve precisely that goal,” Blinken said. “Getting back to the JCPOA remains the best outcome for the United States, for Iran, for the world.” CNN’s Richard Roth and Samantha Beech contributed reporting.",,Nuclear War;Nuclear War;United Nations;United Nations;Cnn;United States;United States;Nuclear Non,"IDEOLOGY,1974;MIL_WEAPONS_PROLIFERATION,353;MANMADE_DISASTER_RADIOACTIVE,3041;ARMEDCONFLICT,208;ARMEDCONFLICT,260;ARMEDCONFLICT,679;ARMEDCONFLICT,1154;ARMEDCONFLICT,2021;ARMEDCONFLICT,2127;ARMEDCONFLICT,3262;ARMEDCONFLICT,3367;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1508;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1320;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1396;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_MILITARY_BASE,2906;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2289;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,420;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,420;WB_1024_PUBLIC_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,420;WB_1026_TREATIES,420;WB_962_INTERNATIONAL_LAW,420;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY_OF_STATE,23;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,3230;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,3335;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,189;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1457;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,3625;DELAY,779;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,779;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,779;UNREST_HUMAN_SHIELD,3108;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,2050;TAX_ETHNICITY_UKRAINIANS,2928;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_UKRAINIANS,2928;LEADER,1478;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1478;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1478;WB_508_POWER_SYSTEMS,2788;WB_509_NUCLEAR_ENERGY,2788;WB_507_ENERGY_AND_EXTRACTIVES,2788;WMD,1154;WMD,2021;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1154;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,2021;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,1154;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,2021;WB_2469_NUCLEAR_AND_CHEMICAL_WAR,1154;WB_2469_NUCLEAR_AND_CHEMICAL_WAR,2021;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3101;ENV_OIL,1311;ENV_OIL,1387;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,65;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,142;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,586;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,675;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,972;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1200;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,1813;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2123;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2270;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2722;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,2864;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIA,3424;GENERAL_HEALTH,817;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,817;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,817;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,817;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,817;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,817;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,817;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,817;SANCTIONS,1269;SANCTIONS,1345;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,104;WB_2503_WEAPONS_PROLIFERATION_AND_ARMS_CONTROL,104;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,104;TAX_DISEASE_CORONAVIRUS,808;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3230;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,3335;SOVEREIGNTY,2309;SOVEREIGNTY,2555;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1307;TAX_ETHNICITY_IRANIAN,1383;WB_135_TRANSPORT,3058;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,3058;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,3058;TAX_FNCACT_DIPLOMAT,486;TAX_FNCACT_DIPLOMAT,3953;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3213;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3318;TAX_ETHNICITY_RUSSIAN,3610;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3213;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3318;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_RUSSIAN,3610;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,630;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,14;",Russian;Pyongyang;North Korea;Budapest;Iran;France;Ukrainians;United States;Russia;Ukraine;Moscow;United Kingdom;Iranian;Kyiv;China,903
27,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/california-mckinney-fire-monday/,"A wildfire in Northern California that exploded in size over the weekend has killed at least two people, forced thousands to evacuate and grown into the state’s largest wildfire this year, with lightning Monday threatening its further expansion. The McKinney Fire broke out Friday afternoon in the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border and has since ripped through more than 55,000 acres, advancing on homes and forcing nearly 2,000 residents to evacuate Saturday, authorities said.  The blaze has become California’s largest wildfire so far this year, Cal Fire Capt. Chris Bruno told CNN. Two people were found dead Sunday morning inside a vehicle that burned in the path of the fire, the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office said. The two were found on a residential driveway along Doggett Creek Road near Highway 96, the sheriff’s office posted Monday morning on Facebook. Officials have not released any more information on them. As the weekend ended, the blaze was 0% contained, and firefighters face a long battle ahead as lightning and thunderstorms complicated efforts while the flames raced through dry vegetation. Heavy smoke over the fire helped slow its growth Sunday but also kept firefighting aircraft grounded, the US Forest Service said in a Sunday night update. Oregon state Rep. Dacia Grayber her husband, both firefighters, were camping near the California state line when they woke up Saturday to orange skies, hot wind gusts, lightning and blowing ash, she said on Twitter. They evacuated from the campground knowing one of them may return on deployment if the fire grows. “In 22+ yrs of fire I’ve never experienced anything like this fire behavior at night. It felt absolutely surreal and not just a little apocalyptic,” Grayber tweeted. The fire is just one symptom of the American West’s historic drought and the human-caused climate change crisis, which has caused more frequent and more severe wildfires. California’s persistent drought conditions have set the scene for rapid fire spread in the forest, with the fires burning extremely dry, receptive fuels, according to the forest service. Sprinting through dry brush, grass and timber, the fire activity has been extreme, with the flames running uphill, and spotting further out, according to fire officials. “Klamath National Forest is a big and beautiful forest, but it also has some steep and rugged terrain. And with that, coupled with the high temperatures, low humidity, they all come into play and make it a very extreme fire danger situation right now,” Tom Stokesberry of the US Forest Service told CNN affiliate KTVL. Over 2 million under red flag warnings Monday The fire risk could intensify Monday. “Abundant lightning” is expected through Monday, as well as scattered thunderstorms, which could spread the flames out further, according to the National Weather Service. “These conditions can be extremely dangerous for firefighters, as winds can be erratic and extremely strong, causing fire to spread in any direction,” forest service officials said in a news release. Dry thunderstorms like those occurring over the weekend happen when rainfall evaporates before ever hitting the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. More than 2 million people are under red flag warnings Monday in parts of northern California, central Oregon, eastern Washington, Montana, eastern Wyoming, western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. And it isn’t the only blaze crews have to contend with. There were 10 different wildfires burning in the Klamath National Forest Sunday afternoon, forest officials said. The fires generated their own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are created from the intense heat of the fire forcing air to rise. Tor Mason was one of the hundreds evacuated due to the McKinney Fire. He and his friends fled their homes and arrived at the Klamath River Community Center, only to find the fire closing in, he told CNN affiliate KDRV. “When I got to the community center it was almost on fire. I’m like, “Holy crap, this isn’t good,” Mason said. “So I put the … pedal to the metal and I boogied. … I heard this morning it shot up in flames.” The fire left a path of destroyed vehicles, scorched structures and haze-filled skies along Highway 96, according to video recorded Saturday by Kirk Eadie, EMS manager for Happy Camp Ambulance. About 650 firefighting personnel have converged on the blaze, attacking the flames from the ground and the air and working to defend evacuated homes. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for Siskiyou County, saying the blaze has destroyed homes and threatened critical infrastructure. Cal Fire said no information was available on structures damaged by the McKinney Fire, though Stokesberry told KTVL there were unconfirmed reports of lost structures. On Saturday, about 60 people were evacuated from the Pacific Crest Trail as the McKinney Fire approached, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon said on its Facebook page, noting the hikers were rescued from the “California side of the Red Buttes Wilderness.” CNN’s Holly Yan, Eric Levenson, David Williams, Paradise Afshar, Tina Burnside, Amanda Jackson and Claire Colbert contributed to this report.",Gavin Newsom;Claire Colbert;Dacia Grayber;Chris Bruno;Amanda Jackson;Tom Stokesberry;Tina Burnside,Twitter;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Facebook;Us Forest Service;Us Forest Service,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,288;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,573;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1972;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2382;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2408;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2963;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3046;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3266;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3294;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3521;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3653;WB_1777_FORESTS,288;WB_1777_FORESTS,573;WB_1777_FORESTS,1972;WB_1777_FORESTS,2382;WB_1777_FORESTS,2408;WB_1777_FORESTS,2963;WB_1777_FORESTS,3046;WB_1777_FORESTS,3266;WB_1777_FORESTS,3294;WB_1777_FORESTS,3521;WB_1777_FORESTS,3653;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,288;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,573;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1972;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2382;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2408;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2963;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3046;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3266;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3294;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3521;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3653;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,288;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,573;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1972;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2382;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2408;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2963;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3046;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3266;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3294;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3521;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3653;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,3564;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1130;WATER_SECURITY,2897;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,2897;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,15;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,132;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,830;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,911;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2183;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,15;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,132;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,830;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,911;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2183;POLITICAL_TURMOIL,3885;STATE_OF_EMERGENCY,3885;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,2436;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,2764;BORDER,321;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,4326;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,4326;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,3968;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,451;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,451;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,451;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,972;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,4343;ARMEDCONFLICT,697;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,2328;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,94;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,4071;AFFECT,428;EVACUATION,428;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,539;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,3709;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1178;DISASTER_FIRE,482;DISASTER_FIRE,1269;DISASTER_FIRE,2618;DISASTER_FIRE,3110;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1990;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2418;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3224;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,1509;NATURAL_DISASTER_STRONG_WINDS,1541;",Yreka;Siskiyou;Jackson County;Oregon;Red Buttes Wilderness;Klamath;California,1073
606,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/asia/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-china-tokyo-intl-hnk/,"China’s Foreign Ministry announced new countermeasures against Washington on Friday, including the suspension of climate talks, in response to Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, hours after it announced sanctions against the US House speaker.  The measures include the cancellation of future phone calls and meetings between Chinese and US defense leaders, for which future dates had not been announced, and the cancellation of annual naval meetings under the China-US military maritime consultation mechanism. China also suspended cooperation on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, legal assistance on criminal matters and the combat of transnational crimes, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a briefing Friday.  It suspended its anti-drug cooperation with the US, which has already been strained in recent years. The US has blamed China for failing to stop synthetic opioids reaching the US as both Beijing and Washington disagree on how to counteract the problem. China’s Foreign Ministry also said it would suspend climate change talks, a major area of cooperation despite escalating tensions in recent years.   The moves come after Beijing announced that it would sanction Pelosi and her immediate family over the visit to Taiwan, and as it stepped up military drills and warplane incursions around the island. Earlier Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry condemned Pelosi for what it described as her “vicious and provocative actions,” saying her trip to Taiwan amounted to “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs.”  “U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted on visiting Taiwan in disregard of China’s serious concerns and firm opposition, seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs, seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, seriously trampling on the one-China principle, and seriously threatening the peace and stability across Taiwan Strait,” a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday.  “In response to Pelosi’s vicious and provocative actions, China has decided to impose sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family,” the statement said. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan on Wednesday, when she met President Tsai Ing-wen and other leaders, has infuriated China’s Communist Party, which views the self-governed democratic island as its territory – despite never having controlled it.  At a news conference in Tokyo during the last stop of her Asia tour, Pelosi struck a defiant tone, saying China had sought to isolate Taiwan from the international community but would not prevent US officials from traveling there. “We will not allow (China) to isolate Taiwan,” the California Democrat said Friday. “They are not doing our travel schedule.” The White House summoned the Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, on Thursday to condemn China’s “irresponsible” military activities following Pelosi’s trip, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post.    Ahead of the visit, Beijing had warned it would take “forceful measures” if Pelosi went ahead, and on her departure it launched live-fire military exercises and sent missiles over Taiwan for the first time.   Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said as of 11 a.m. Friday, several Chinese military jets and warships had conducted exercises around the Taiwan Strait and crossed the median line – the halfway point between the island and mainland China. Taiwan’s military responded with radio warnings, air patrol forces, naval ships, and shore-based missile systems, the ministry said. On Thursday, China sent 22 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), all of them crossing the median line.  A number of countries, including from the G7 grouping of some of the world’s largest economies, have criticized China’s drills, urging Beijing not to change the status quo in the region. In her comments on Friday, Pelosi said the visit to Taiwan had been about maintaining the status quo. “It’s about the Taiwan Relations Act, the US-China policy, all of the pieces of legislation and agreements that have established what our relationship is – to have peace in the Taiwan Strait and to have the status quo prevail,” she said. Pelosi also rejected suggestions by some critics that her visit had more to do with burnishing her legacy than benefiting the island, calling the claim “ridiculous.”  She pointed to Taiwan’s “free and open democracy,” successful economy and relatively progressive LGBTQ rights. “This isn’t about me – it’s about them,” she added. “It’s about Taiwan, and I am proud to have worked over the years to showcase the concerns that they have with mainland China.” Meanwhile Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday called for an immediate halt to China’s drills, saying they were “a serious issue concerning the security of our country and its people.”  Earlier, Japan lodged a formal complaint after five Chinese missiles landed in its Exclusive Economic Zone. Amid worsening relations, China canceled a planned meeting between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers. On Thursday, China’s Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li summoned envoys to China from European countries, the EU and Japan in protest of their statements regarding Taiwan. The G7 statement “distorts the facts” and is a “blatant political provocation,” said Deng, who accused the countries involved of interfering with China’s internal affairs. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan was the first by a sitting House speaker in 25 years, since then-House Speaker Speaker Newt Gingrich’s visit in 1997. Her Asia tour also included stops in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.

230,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/us/parkland-trial-nikolas-cruz-victim-testimony/,"It wasn’t until Anthony Montalto was sitting next to his wife testifying in a Florida courtroom Wednesday that he realized he was wearing the same clothes he wore the last time he took his daughter Gina to a father-daughter dance.  “I was so happy to be her father,” Montalto said as he delivered his victim impact statement in the trial of Gina’s killer, who faces the death penalty for the mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school on Valentine’s Day 2018.  “Gina didn’t come home from school that day,” said Jennifer Montalto, who, along with her husband, described their daughter as an avid reader who was quick to volunteer and once saved a boy who fell into the pool where she was playing. Now there’s an empty seat at their table, she said, a bedroom where her daughter will never sleep and a front door she will never walk through – each of them objects that prompt a feeling of “unspeakable loss.”   Where their house was once was filled with laughter, Anthony Montalto said, “now there’s a deafening silence broken only by the deep sighs and soft sobbing that accompany what used to be happy memories of my children playing.” Wednesday was the third day of victim impact testimony in the trial of Nikolas Cruz, who has already pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder for the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.  More victim impact testimony is expected Thursday, the judge indicated, but jurors are also set to visit the scene of the massacre, Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ 1200 building, which has remained sealed since the shooting in order to preserve it for the gunman’s trial. Cruz will not be attending the visit. Following Wednesday’s testimony, Judge Elizabeth Scherer and attorneys for the prosecution and defense outlined the instructions that Scherer read to the jurors before they were sent home, including a recommendation that they wear closed-toe shoes.  The visit is meant to help jurors analyze the evidence presented in the trial so far, the judge explained. It will take place both outside and inside, she said, where jurors will be guided but able to explore the scene on each floor. Jurors are not to touch anything, and they may not bring phones or cameras.  The current phase of the trial is to determine Cruz’s sentence: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while Cruz’s defense attorneys are asking the jury for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. To recommend a death sentence, jurors must be unanimous. If they do so, the judge could choose to follow the recommendation or sentence Cruz to life instead. Much of the testimony – particularly from the parents of the 14 students killed – focused on all the things the victims and their families will never get to do and the irreparable damage to their everyday lives.  “Our family is broken. There is this constant emptiness,” said Max Schachter, the father of 14-year-old Alex, who loved chocolate chip cookies, playing the trombone and video games.  “I feel I can’t truly be happy if I smile,” Schachter said. “I know that behind that smile is the sharp realization that part of me will always be sad and miserable because Alex isn’t here.” Isabel Dalu, a close friend of the family of Cara Loughran, told the court about all the things the 14-year-old was looking forward to when she was gunned down: Her birthday was a week later, and she’d be old enough to get her learner’s permit. She’d recently started Irish dancing again, and she was excited to dance in the St. Patrick’s Day parade. The family had a trip to Ireland for that summer to visit family.  “She dreamed of her first date, her first kiss and falling in love,” Dalu said. “Cara dreamed of going to homecoming and prom, she dreamed of graduating at the top of her class with all of her loved ones watching.”  “But Cara didn’t make it to any of these milestones,” she added. Widow of assistant coach who shielded students testifies Fred Guttenberg, the father of 14-year-old victim Jaime, said Tuesday that her older brother, who was also a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas at the time of the shooting, “Wishes it was him.”  “He struggles,” Guttenberg said, “with the reality that he could not save his sister, and he wishes it was him.” Melissa Feis, the widow of Aaron Feis, an assistant football coach who died after throwing himself in front of students to protect them from the gunfire, wrote in a statement read in court by a friend Tuesday that he “was the doting father who every little girl wishes and dreams about.”  “I can see his light in Ariel and recognize his spirit woven into her fabric,” the statement said, referring to their daughter, as Melissa Feis sat still in court with her eyes closed.  Raising their daughter as a widow “can be overwhelming and challenging,” she wrote, and it’s painful knowing there are milestones in their daughter’s life that Feis has missed.  “Aaron isn’t here to give his fatherly guidance and advice,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking and unimaginable at times. And yet, it’s my reality.”  ‘Never again will the world feel right’ To make their decision, jurors will hear prosecutors and defense attorneys argue aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances – reasons Cruz should or should not be executed. Victim impact statements add another layer, giving the families and friends of the victims their own day in court, though the judge told the jury the statements are not meant to be weighed as aggravating factors. “We don’t have a system where it’s the victims’ families that get to decide whether you live or die if you kill their family members,” Teresa Reid, legal skills professor at the University of Florida’s Levin College of Law, has told CNN.  “We don’t have revenge. And so this is the mechanism that the family has.” The loss of her daughter Meadow Pollack, 18, has “destroyed” Shara Kaplan’s life, she told the jury Tuesday, “and my capability of ever living a productive existence.” To articulate how her daughter’s death impacted her, she said, she would have to rip out her heart and show them how it had shattered into a million pieces. And the Hoyer family will never be the same.  “We were a family unit of five always trying to fit into a world set up for even numbers,” said Tom Hoyer, whose 15-year-old son Luke – the youngest of three – was killed. “Two-, four-, six-seat tables in a restaurant. Two-, four-, six-ticket packages to events. Things like that.” But the Hoyers are no longer a family of five, and “never again will the world feel right, now that we’re a family of four,” Hoyer said. “When Luke died something went missing in me,” he said. “And I’ll never, never get over that feeling.”",Melissa Feis;Melissa Feis;Teresa Reid;Tom Hoyer;Tom Hoyer;Shara Kaplan;Lori Alhadeff;Lori Alhadeff;Max Schachter;Ilan Alhadeff;Ilan Alhadeff;Anthony Montalto;Anthony Montalto;Cara Loughran;Aaron Feis;Fred Guttenberg;Gena Hoyer;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Nikolas Cruz;Jennifer Montalto;Jennifer Montalto;Marjory Stoneman Douglas;Marjory Stoneman Douglas;Isabel Dalu,University Of Florida Levin College Of Law;Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;Aaron;Aaron;Cnn;Cnn;Mcdonald;Mcdonald,"EDUCATION,445;EDUCATION,707;EDUCATION,1621;EDUCATION,5615;EDUCATION,5772;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,267;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,2434;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,3689;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,4205;",Irish;Florida;Ireland,1459
489,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/yu-and-me-books-asian-american-representation-cec/,"Editor’s Note: “United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell” airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET. Watch this week’s episode for more on Asian American representation in the media. Lucy Yu found refuge in books growing up. An only child raised by a Chinese immigrant mother in west Los Angeles, she spent a lot of time in bookstores. But it seemed that the stories she connected to most – those written by immigrants and people of color – were often relegated to a single shelf or a heritage month display. “I just wanted to walk into a place where I didn’t have to search that much,” she said. Yu, a chemical engineer by training, started researching and found an abundance of titles going back decades from authors with names or backgrounds like hers. But she said many of those books had quickly been placed on the backlist, a publishing term referring to older books that are still in print but typically aren’t being actively promoted. “I think that the publishing industry didn’t think that they were going to sell or didn’t think that people were interested in our stories,” Yu added. “But they had always been there and these authors and these writers and these stories have always been there.” Yu launched a crowdfunding campaign last year to turn her vision into reality, and hit her goal in just a few weeks, affirming that she wasn’t alone in wanting more of these books. In December, Yu and Me Books opened its doors in Manhattan’s Chinatown, and has been steadily growing since. The store now has four staff members, including Yu. The bookstore has also become a literary and community hub. Yu and Me Books has hosted conversations with immigrant authors, a pop-up book workshop and clothing swaps. And as Asian Americans in New York, including Chinatown, faced attacks against their communities, the store partnered with the nonprofit Soar Over Hate to hand out free pepper spray and personal safety devices. Yu sees room for progress in publishing  Despite this, Yu didn’t set out to open an Asian American bookstore. When she first conceived of her small business, she dreamed of a space that would reflect the rich diversity of her community. She envisioned a place dedicated to stories written by immigrants and people of color – which happened to include Asian American authors.  The space still reflects her vision. But perhaps because of Yu’s own Asian American identity, perhaps because of her bookstore’s historic location or perhaps because of a hunger among Asian Americans for authentic depictions of their communities, Yu and Me Books has since become a go-to for Asian American readers hoping to find their experiences reflected on its shelves. “It’s been really interesting seeing how I’ve kind of been pushed into the Asian American bookstores lane,” she said. “I think that if I weren’t Asian American, I may not have had to put myself within that slot.” That feeling of being pigeonholed is familiar for many Asian Americans, whether they work in media, the restaurant industry or the literary scene like Yu. For so long, Asian American representation in creative sectors has been scarce, while Asian American depictions in popular culture have been replete with tired tropes and stereotypes. So when Yu launched her community-centered bookstore last year, it came with added pressure and expectations.  While Yu has held to her mission of highlighting stories of immigrants and people of color more broadly, she’s leaned into customers’ demand for books by Asian American authors. Most of her inventory now skews toward Asian American books, she said – making Yu and Me Books a rare and special place. “As someone who’s thinking about my own identity and also a business owner, I want to be able to support whoever wants to come in and find books that represent themselves,” she said. “But I love that there is a lot of love and desire for Asian American books and representation.” Still, Yu makes it a point to both challenge and delight visitors to her store.  Her shelves include bestsellers such as Min Jin Lee’s “Pachinko” and Michelle Zauner’s “Crying in H Mart,” as well as niche titles from smaller presses. Visitors can thumb through cookbooks, romance novels, young adult novels and poetry volumes by Asian American authors – and the selection keeps growing. For a couple hours most evenings, a glass of wine in hand, Yu researches what other books she doesn’t yet know about that she might acquire. “One of my favorite things that I hear when customers come in the store (is), ‘I’ve never heard of this title before’ or ‘I’ve never seen like 40% of this inventory before.’” Yu said. “That makes me so happy because you can connect to a story that’s not necessarily being pushed by publishers.” As Yu and Me Books celebrates and showcases the breadth of works that Asian American writers have produced over decades, Yu also encourages her visitors to keep an open mind. “I also try to remind readers as much as I can that outside the Asian American experience, there’s so many books written by other immigrants that we can relate to very much,” she added. In the time that Yu and Me Books has been open, Yu said she’s seen positive changes in the publishing industry. She’s seeing more diversity in the authors who are getting published, but those authors are often called upon to be “educators of our experience,” Yu said. As exciting as it is to see these experiences represented authentically, she hopes the industry will reach a point where authors can transcend their identities. “I want authors of color to just write about unicorns or cupcakes – whatever they want to write about,” she added.",Los Angeles;Lucy Yu,Joy Luck Club To Crazy Rich Asians;Joy Luck Club To Crazy Rich Asians;Cnn,"WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,593;WB_2198_CHEMICAL_ENGINEERING,593;WB_2197_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENGINEERING,593;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,393;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,2051;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,2379;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,3777;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANTS,5370;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,114;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1697;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1972;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2101;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2163;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2429;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2521;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2634;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2740;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2895;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,2963;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3087;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3202;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3276;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3569;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3683;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3861;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,3924;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,4230;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,4590;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,5132;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,5300;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,948;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3152;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,5525;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,5775;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,216;MEDIA_MSM,151;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,151;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3126;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,151;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3126;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,151;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3126;EDUCATION,5649;TAX_FNCACT_EDUCATORS,5649;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1707;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2111;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2644;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,3097;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIANS,3520;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIANS,3634;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,919;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2940;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,123;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,1981;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2172;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2438;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2530;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2749;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2904;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2972;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3211;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3285;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3578;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3692;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3870;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3933;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4239;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4599;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,5141;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,5309;TAX_FNCACT_ENGINEER,593;TAX_FNCACT_STAFF_MEMBERS,1506;SCIENCE,627;IMMIGRATION,246;IMMIGRATION,1636;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANT,246;TAX_FNCACT_IMMIGRANT,1636;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,246;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_MIGRATION,1636;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_KAMAU,39;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,236;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,236;",Americans;Manhattan;Chinese;New York;American,1138

418,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/florida-python-challenge-everglades/,"Deer, raccoons, possums and fox once flocked the area of the Everglades National Park in south Florida. Nowadays, you’re lucky if you spot one mammal in the area, according to wildlife experts. Who’s to blame for this decline in wildlife? The invasive species known as Burmese pythons. To help combat this problem for Florida’s ecosystem, snake hunters are congregating in the hundreds for the Florida Python Challenge. The event, created by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, started in 2013. “I love snakes. I hate that we have to do this, but they’re invasive and changing the entire ecosystem.” professional python hunter Amy Siewe told CNN. According to the commission, these reptiles were detected as early as 1979 in Florida. “They were introduced to Florida through accidental and intentional release through the pet trade,” a spokesperson with the commission told CNN on Friday. Since then, they’ve killed and continue to pose a major threat to wildlife. The event brings hundreds of professional snake hunters to the Everglades to hunt and kill the reptiles. As of Friday, more than 850 people had signed up, the commission said. August 5 marked the start of this year’s 10-day challenge.  To participate, members were required to take an online training course and pay a $25 registration fee. The hunter who brings back the most pythons wins $2,500. Last year, participants killed more than 200 pythons.  Aside from the challenge, year-round removal efforts are still in play. Since 2000, more than 17,000 pythons have been removed and reported, according to the commission. Michael Kirkland, a biologist with the South Florida Water Management District, told CNN that pythons have been “decimating wildlife for years.” “The challenge is designed to remove as many pythons from the area as possible,” he said, “Human detection and removal are the most efficient and effective tools in the toolbox right now,”  Contractors hired with the water management district work year-round and participate in the challenge to capture the creatures. Kirkland said there has been up to a 90% decline of animals in the area due to pythons.  A full-time job Among the many partaking in the challenge this year are Siewe and Donna Kalil. Kalil told CNN he has been professionally hunting the reptiles since 2017. Siewe was hired in 2019. Combined, the two have killed more than 1,000 pythons – Kalil at more than 670 and Siewe at close to 400. They share a love for the creatures but understand the importance of this challenge. “The hunters are the best way we have at this moment to help with this problem,” Siewe said. Kalil grew up in Florida and said when she went to the Everglades as a kid there were “so many rabbits you couldn’t count them all.” Fast forward to the 2000s when Kalil said there were practically no rabbits, possums or raccoons as a result of the pythons. In last year’s challenge, Kalil took home the $2,500 prize for removing the most pythons at 19. She’s been participating since 2013. This will be Siewe’s third year. In her first year, she won second place for heaviest snake.  The two will base their hunting on factors like weather, time of day and sleep schedule. “This time of the year, the nighttime is best to go out,” Kalil said. And hunting doesn’t come easy. Throughout her career, Siewe has suffered from many python bites and said she doesn’t recommend it. “It’s like a warm knife going through butter,” Siewe described. Pythons, while not venomous, have hundreds of teeth that are razor sharp, according to Siewe. The creatures can grow to massive sizes and it’s a feat to take them on. Siewe said her largest capture measured 17 feet and 110 pounds, which she caught standing 5 foot 4. Kalil shares that you can’t catch them all. “I’ve had four get away from me during my career,” she said. “It can be difficult during the night in the water and weeds.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been an avid fan of the python challenge. In a June press release, he said, “I am proud of the progress we’ve made, and I look forward to seeing the results of this year’s Python Challenge.”  In fact, his wife, Casey DeSantis, said in a press conference Friday that her 10-year anniversary gift to the governor was a pair of python skin boots.",Michael Kirkland;Donna Kalil;Donna Kalil;Donna Kalil;Donna Kalil;Ron Desantis;Thomas Aycock;Thomas Aycock;Amy Siewe;Amy Siewe;Amy Siewe;Amy Siewe;Casey Desantis,Wildlife Conservation Commission;Everglades National Park;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RABBITS,3097;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RABBITS,3200;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2003;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESPERSON,876;WB_2670_JOBS,3941;WB_2670_JOBS,4419;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,3941;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,4419;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,3941;WB_2048_COMPENSATION_CAREERS_AND_INCENTIVES,4419;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,3941;WB_723_PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATION,4419;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,3941;WB_724_HUMAN_RESOURCES_FOR_PUBLIC_SECTOR,4419;LEADER,4827;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,4827;ARMEDCONFLICT,321;TAX_FNCACT_BIOLOGIST,1790;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKE,368;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKE,1031;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKE,3471;WB_427_WATER_ALLOCATION_AND_WATER_ECONOMICS,1830;WB_427_WATER_ALLOCATION_AND_WATER_ECONOMICS,2137;WB_1064_WATER_DEMAND_MANAGEMENT,1830;WB_1064_WATER_DEMAND_MANAGEMENT,2137;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTER,655;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTER,1498;TAX_WORLDFISH_FISH,476;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKES,544;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKES,3646;TAX_WORLDREPTILES_SNAKES,3764;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTERS,376;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTERS,1039;TAX_FNCACT_HUNTERS,2915;WB_698_TRADE,859;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,295;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,1211;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,1293;WB_137_WATER,1819;WB_137_WATER,2126;WB_137_WATER,4481;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,360;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,628;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3730;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3848;KILL,942;KILL,1579;KILL,2382;KILL,2473;KILL,2752;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,942;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1579;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2382;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2473;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,2752;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,88;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,88;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,88;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,88;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RACCOONS,16;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_RACCOONS,3221;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_FOX,34;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,203;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,256;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,487;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,988;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1893;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,976;",Everglades National Park;Florida;Burmese,990
391,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/entertainment/anne-heche-car-crash-sunday/,"Anne Heche is in stable condition Sunday, two days after the car she was driving crashed into a home and became engulfed in flames, a representative for the actress said. “Her family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time,” the representative said. Heche was previously in an intensive care unit with “severe burns” following the Friday crash, a source close to Heche told CNN Saturday morning. “She’s lucky to be alive,” the source said. “She has severe burns and has a long recovery ahead. Her team and her family are still trying to process what led up to the crash.” The vehicle was traveling at high speed when it ran off the road and collided with a residence, Los Angeles Police Public Information Officer Jeff Lee told CNN on Friday.  Heche was taken to a local hospital by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics in critical condition. It took firefighters more than an hour to “access, confine and fully extinguish the stubborn flames within the heavily damaged structure,” the LAFD said. There were no other injuries reported. Hours before Heche’s crash on Friday, a new episode of her podcast “Better Together” was released but has since been removed from an Apple Podcast landing page.    During part of the podcast, Heche and her co-host, Heather Duffy, discuss drinking vodka and wine, and Heche talks about having a “bad day.” It’s unclear when the podcast was recorded. CNN has reached out to Heche’s representatives for comment. “Today’s been a very unique day,” Heche says in the podcast. “I don’t know what happened, sometimes days just suck and I don’t know if you ever have them, but some days Mama says are … some days are those no good very bad days. And I don’t know why some days just end up like this, and things don’t really rock me like that.” On Saturday, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN authorities had yet to question Heche about the circumstances of the incident.  The significant nature of her injuries have prevented officers from interviewing her, the law enforcement source said.  The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the crash and a previous “misdemeanor hit and run” incident, an LAPD spokesperson told CNN on Saturday evening.  LAPD said no arrests have been made.  Heche first rose to fame on the soap opera “Another World,” where she played the dual role of twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love from 1987 to 1991 and earned a Daytime Emmy Award. She followed that with films including “Donnie Brasco,” “Six Days Seven Nights,” and “Wag the Dog.” Her romantic relationship with Ellen DeGeneres in the late ’90s resulted in intense media attention, much to Heche’s professional frustration. In a 2021 interview with Page Six, Heche said she felt “blacklisted” after going public with their relationship. “I didn’t do a studio picture for 10 years,” said Heche, who dated DeGeneres from 1997 to 2000.

592,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/entertainment/john-legend-miscarriage-abortion-rights-trnd/,"Just over a month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, musician John Legend is advocating for abortion access and reproductive rights. In an interview with David Axelrod for CNN’s “The Axe Files” podcast, Legend described his own experience with wife, model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen’s 2020 miscarriage. “Anyone who’s dealt with pregnancy knows none of this is casual, none of this is frivolous. And it’s so intimate, and it’s so personal,” he said. “Why do we want our government involved in those decisions?” Legend referenced strict abortion restrictions in certain states that have led to limits on patients’ ability to access standard miscarriage care. One woman in Texas, for instance, was forced to carry fetal remains inside her for two and a half weeks after miscarrying last year because of strict anti-abortion laws.  “Anyone who has a miscarriage, after all that trauma, all that pain, all those tears we went through, to then have the local DA or local law enforcement do an investigation and make sure the miscarriage was approved by the state… to have the government involved in that conversation in any way is so offensive to me,” he said. Teigen and Legend announced that they had lost their child after pregnancy complications in 2020. Teigen had been about halfway through with her pregnancy with the couple’s third child, whom they had started calling Jack. Teigen was vocal about the difficulties of her miscarriage, and wrote an emotional essay about the traumatic loss.  The two are parents to Luna and Miles, both conceived through IVF, and announced on Wednesday that they are expecting another child.  Government involvement in reproductive rights is “nasty, it’s evil. It should not be even a discussion. The government should not be involved,” Legend said. In his interview with Axelrod, Legend emphasized the devastating experiences of patients who undergo late-term abortions. “Anyone who makes that gut-wrenching decision at that point in the pregnancy, they’re only doing it because they have a serious reason to do it, whether it’s the health of the mother or the health of the child,” he said.  The star hopes he can use his platform to advocate for change. “I’ve grown over time in understanding how to use my celebrity and how to use the power that I have and the reach that I have and the resources that I have to actually make change.”",John Legend;David Axelrod;Chrissy Teigen,Supreme Court;Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,481;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1084;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1635;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1741;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,481;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1084;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1635;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1741;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,665;TAX_FNCACT_MUSICIAN,73;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,612;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1217;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1339;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,1621;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,2109;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,999;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,999;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,999;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,999;GENERAL_HEALTH,2069;GENERAL_HEALTH,2096;MEDICAL,2069;MEDICAL,2096;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,979;MEDIA_MSM,270;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,311;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,651;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,853;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,1027;TAX_DISEASE_MISCARRIAGE,1436;LEGISLATION,821;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY_COMPLICATIONS,1247;WB_1454_EMERGENCY_OBSTETRIC_CARE,1247;WB_641_REPRODUCTIVE_AND_MATERNAL_HEALTH,1247;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1247;WB_639_REPRODUCTIVE_MATERNAL_AND_CHILD_HEALTH,1247;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,877;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,877;SECURITY_SERVICES,979;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,979;WB_840_JUSTICE,979;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,979;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,979;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,979;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,979;EPU_POLICY_LAW,967;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2318;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,346;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,1233;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,1311;TAX_DISEASE_PREGNANCY,1978;",Texas,491
498,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/texas-asian-hate-crime-sentencing/,"A North Texas man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for assaulting an Asian family he blamed for the Covid-19 pandemic, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.  Jose Gomez III, 21, pleaded guilty in February to three counts of committing hate crimes. CNN has reached out to his lawyer for comment. Gomez saw a Burmese family with three young children enter a Sam’s Club in Midland, Texas, in March 2020, and, believing they were Chinese, followed them into the store, according to federal prosecutors.  Gomez grabbed kitchen knives that were being sold at the store and attacked the family, slashing the father and a child who was then 6 years old, according to the criminal complaint.  Prosecutors said Thursday the blade of the knife entered millimeters from the child’s right eye, cut his ear and slashed the back of the child’s head.  A store employee who intervened was also stabbed in the leg, according to prosecutors. As the suspect was being held to the ground, prosecutors said, he yelled to the Asian family – “Get out of America!” Gomez later admitted to authorities he had attacked the family and that he targeted the father and “whoever I think came from the country who started spreading the disease around.”  Gomez told authorities he intended to kill the father and also admitted to targeting the children, the complaint said. Hate crimes across the US have risen since the onset of the pandemic, including attacks on Asian Americans, who are often brutally – and sometimes fatally – targeted and erroneously blamed for the pandemic. “It is our hope today’s sentence will help the victims with the healing process,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeffery R. Downey said in a statement. “Rest assured, the FBI and our law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue anyone who commits these violent acts to ensure the civil rights of all Americans are protected.” ",,Sam Club In Midland;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1063;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1149;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,1390;WB_1406_DISEASES,1390;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,80;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1020;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1122;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1208;TAX_ETHNICITY_ASIAN,1617;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1774;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,622;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,768;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,824;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,612;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,1316;TAX_FNCACT_FATHER,1453;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,1627;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,2036;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYER,289;TAX_FNCACT_SPECIAL_AGENT,1824;GENERAL_HEALTH,123;GENERAL_HEALTH,1588;GENERAL_HEALTH,1719;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,123;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1588;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1719;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,123;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1588;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1719;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,123;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1588;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1719;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,123;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1588;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1719;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,123;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1588;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1719;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,123;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1588;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1719;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,123;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1588;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1719;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1259;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1422;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1259;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1422;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1259;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1422;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1086;SOC_GENERALCRIME,1172;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1086;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1172;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1334;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,114;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_PRISON,56;WB_2495_DETENTION_PRISON_AND_CORRECTIONS_REFORM,56;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,56;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,56;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,56;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1128;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1214;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1774;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1774;KILL,1442;TRIAL,44;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,669;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2019;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,2019;TAX_FNCACT_AGENT,1824;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_BURMESE,324;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_CRIME,254;UNREST_SELF_IDENTIFIED_HATE_CRIME,1531;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEE,861;SECURITY_SERVICES,1920;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1920;WB_840_JUSTICE,1920;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1920;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1920;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1920;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1920;LEGISLATION,1908;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1908;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,22;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,353;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,1495;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,145;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,502;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,696;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,931;TAX_FNCACT_PROSECUTORS,990;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,436;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,436;",Americans;America;Chinese;Texas;Florida;Burmese,380
138,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/biden-still-covid-positive/,"President Joe Biden is still testing positive for Covid-19 and “continues to feel well” as he experiences a rebound case of the virus, according to his physician.  Dr. Kevin O’Connor said in a memo on Monday that the President tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test earlier in the morning, “as could be anticipated,” and continues to follow “strict isolation measures” at the White House.  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that Biden is not experiencing any “recurring symptoms” and will follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and isolate for five days. Monday marked day two of that latest isolation. “He’s feeling fine,” Jean-Pierre told reporters at a White House briefing.  Jean-Pierre said, “As you know, some of you have had Covid … those symptoms that you have don’t go away right away, they kind of linger, those minimal symptoms kind of linger for some time. So you can expect that.” The President is once again isolating at the White House after emerging from isolation from his first case of Covid-19 in the middle of last week. He has not left the White House in 12 days.  O’Connor said on Saturday that the President had experienced “no reemergence of symptoms, and continues to feel quite well.” In memos on Sunday and Monday, O’Connor said the President “continues to feel well,” but made no explicit mention of symptoms.  Due to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death. The President, who is fully vaccinated and double boosted, first tested positive on July 21 and had mild symptoms for several days before ending his isolation on Wednesday following two negative Covid-19 tests. He completed a five-day course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people age 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription. But after giving a speech from the Rose Garden on Wednesday in which the President said he was “feeling great” and back to working in person, he tested positive on Saturday.  The CDC recently issued guidance saying people who test positive again and whose symptoms come back after finishing their antiviral pills should restart their isolation period and isolate for five full days. The agency says people can end their isolation period after those five additional days as long as their fever has been gone for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication and they’re feeling better. The agency also recommends that people wear a mask for 10 days after their symptoms come back.",Kevin Oconnor;Joe Biden,White House;White House;White House;Us Centers For Disease;Drug Administration;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_PHYSICIAN,163;GENERAL_HEALTH,959;TAX_DISEASE_DISEASE,959;WB_1406_DISEASES,959;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,959;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,959;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1358;WB_1331_HEALTH_TECHNOLOGIES,1444;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1358;WB_2453_ORGANIZED_CRIME,1444;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1358;WB_1350_PHARMACEUTICALS,1444;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1358;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1444;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1358;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1444;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1358;WB_2456_DRUGS_AND_NARCOTICS,1444;TAX_DISEASE_FEVER,2089;LEADER,14;LEADER,228;LEADER,426;LEADER,681;LEADER,814;LEADER,1120;LEADER,1685;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,14;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,228;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,426;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,681;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,814;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1120;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,1685;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,14;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,228;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,426;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,681;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,814;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1120;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1685;MEDICAL,1588;TAX_FNCACT_DOCTOR,1588;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,980;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,980;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,980;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,980;WB_2026_PREVENTION,980;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1402;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1420;WB_670_ICT_SECURITY,1420;WB_2372_AUTHENTICATION_AND_AUTHORIZATION,1420;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1420;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,394;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,469;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,614;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,63;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,257;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,546;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,921;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1299;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1502;",White House,583
62,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/us/kentucky-flooding-california-wildfires-drought-climate/,"Extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum has thrashed parts of the US over the past week – one of the many signals that climate change is here now, scientists say. On the one hand, overwhelming rainfall triggered two ultra-rare floods last week, one in the St. Louis area and another in eastern Kentucky that has left dozens dead or missing. On the other, a fiery drought has fueled California’s largest wildfire of the year so far – the McKinney Fire – which burned so hot over the weekend that massive pyrocumulus clouds erupted into the atmosphere. Expect more of these extremes as the planet warms, said Kevin Reed, a climate scientist at Stony Brook University, and prepare for them. “Every weather event has some flavor of climate change in it because it’s impossible to decouple them,” Reed told CNN. “It’s another sign that climate change is here. It’s not just a challenge for the next 400 years from now or 50 years from now; in reality, it’s something that we need to rapidly adjust to, adapt to and become more resilient to now.”  Climate experts anticipate heavy rain events to increase in intensity and frequency as the planet warms, since warmer air can hold more moisture. That concept is easier for most people to grasp in the case of a hurricane, Reed said.  For instance, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped more than 60 inches of rain in parts of Texas and slammed the coast with an 8-foot storm surge. Scientists have said climate change made Harvey’s rainfall more extreme. But that same process plays out over land as water evaporates from the soil, grass, crops and forests. And more moisture can be drawn out of soil and vegetation the warmer it gets.  “Part of that is the general circulation of the atmosphere-ocean system which moves air around the world and brings moisture into areas over land,” Reed said. “Another aspect is that, over the last 100 plus years, the land surface has actually warmed more than the ocean, so the largest signal that we’re actually seeing in surface temperature is occurring overland, and inland as well.”  What it adds up to is a higher risk of dangerous flooding. “While extreme events and floods have sort of always been a part of a climate cycle, they can get more frequent and they can be a lot more intense as the planet is warmed,” Beth Tellman, co-founder of flood database Cloud to Street and assistant professor of geography at the University of Arizona, told CNN. “The intensity of rainfall from the storm systems in both St. Louis and eastern Kentucky are the reality and the physical manifestation of (climate change) happening now in our lives.”  Andrew Smith, a co-founder and director at the flood modeling group Fathom, analyzed the St. Louis flooding event and noted that while there is a strong connection between the climate crisis and extreme rainfall, researchers have also pointed to population growth as one of the factors that will increase the risk and impact of flooding.  “In many ways, it’s these isolated flash flood events in urban centers that will see a lot of amplification in hazard and risk in the future,” Smith said. “We have more faith in finding (a climate change connection) to these kinds of localized extreme rainfall events.” “They do seem to be happening more frequently,” he added.  The flooding, wildfire, heat waves and drought paint a picture of a nation in peril. And as one part of the country recovers from extreme rainfall, another can be scorched by deadly fires.  The McKinney fire in Northern California, which exploded in size over the weekend to become the state’s largest so far this year, burned uncontrolled Monday amid the West’s historic drought.   The fire generated its own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are triggered by intense heat that forces air to rise rapidly and are a sign of how large and hot the fire was burning.  At the same time, forecasters at the National Weather Service warned that “dry lightning” was possible Monday – a phenomenon that is made more likely by exceptional drought. The dry air evaporates the storm’s rain before it ever hits the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. The climate crisis is ultimately intensifying the water cycle, not only making dry periods drier and wet periods wetter. All this, Tellman said, is another reason why policymakers need to put more focus on adaptation – helping communities adapt to the climate crisis and grow more resilient against extreme weather. “Passing a climate bill and moving forward politically in the US is really important and linked to preventing and trying to reduce the amount of rain that’s falling from the sky that’s causing events like we’re seeing in Kentucky and Yellowstone and St. Louis,” Tellman said.  “This is a real impact on our lives, so we need more mitigation, good climate legislation, and we also have to invest in adaptation to reduce impact for the future,” she added. “It’s going to get a lot worse if we don’t limit warming.”",Cawx Cafirepic;Kevin Reed;Andrew Smith;Beth Tellman;Robert Shackelford,Stony Brook University;Remarkable;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;University Of Arizona,"TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,4701;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,4041;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,2639;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,20;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,5040;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,20;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,5040;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,20;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5040;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,20;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,5040;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,20;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,5040;WATER_SECURITY,367;WATER_SECURITY,3704;WATER_SECURITY,4030;WATER_SECURITY,4524;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,367;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,3704;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4030;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,4524;KILL,323;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,323;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,323;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,129;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,620;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,727;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,825;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1364;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1750;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2474;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2845;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3184;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3526;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4740;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4987;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5061;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,5384;LEGISLATION,5396;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5396;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,5396;SCIENCE,630;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,630;POPULATION_DENSITY,3263;WB_640_POPULATION_AND_DEMOGRAPHIC_CHANGE,3263;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,3263;WB_1448_DEMOGRAPHIC_CHANGE,3263;DISASTER_FIRE,4168;DISASTER_FIRE,4339;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,235;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2429;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2396;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2915;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,2975;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3110;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3332;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,3670;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2396;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2915;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,2975;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3110;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3332;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,3670;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,4130;WB_1777_FORESTS,4130;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4130;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1576;NATURAL_DISASTER_HURRICANE,1616;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2611;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,2611;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,2611;WB_2945_DATABASE,2611;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAVY_RAIN,1394;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2649;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,3041;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,406;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,3681;NATURAL_DISASTER_STORM_SURGE,1720;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1477;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2054;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4282;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4537;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,136;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,734;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,832;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,1757;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,2852;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,3533;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,136;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,734;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,832;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1757;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,2852;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3533;URBAN,3396;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVES,3694;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOOD,3380;EDUCATION,656;EDUCATION,2680;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,656;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2680;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1292;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,1029;WB_2120_SATELLITES,1029;WB_2329_ACCESS_AND_CONNECTIVITY,1029;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1029;WB_137_WATER,1840;WB_137_WATER,4784;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,2602;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3054;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOOD,3380;USPEC_POLICY1,4909;EPU_POLICY_POLICYMAKERS,4909;",California;Texas;Klamath;Kentucky,1042

672,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/europe/eu-uk-drought-warnings-weather-climate-intl/,"Sixty-three percent of land in the European Union and United Kingdom – an area nearly the same size as India – is now under either drought warnings or alerts, according to data published by the European Drought Observatory on Wednesday. The new figures mark a slight increase from a 10-day period earlier in July, with 46% of land now covered by “warnings,” which means there is a deficit of moisture in the soil, while 17% is under the more severe level of “alert,” where vegetation is stressed. The area is also bigger than the US’ three largest states – Alaska, Texas and California – combined.  A map accompanying the data shows a high concentration of the more severe alert level in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Hungary and Romania. An update on Wednesday by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology suggested that warmer-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average rainfall was likely to affect the southeast of the country, mostly England, until October. Water companies in these areas are considering more hosepipe bans on millions of customers in coming weeks. On Monday, the EU’s climate monitoring agency Copernicus said that much of Europe experienced a drier-than-average July, with several local records broken in the west for low rainfall and drought hitting several parts of southwestern and southeastern Europe.  In its monthly climate update, Copernicus said those conditions facilitated the spread and intensification of wildfires, fueled also by back-to-back heat waves in parts of Europe, in what is shaping up to be one of the continent’s hottest summers on record. The new data comes as the world grapples with a food crisis only just abating as Russia lifts its blockade of grain exports from Ukraine. Extreme weather and supply chain issues have worsened the crisis and are likely to persist for some time.  A recent report by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s science service, forecast a drop of 8-9% in the production of grain maize, sunflowers and soybeans in the EU because of hot and dry conditions over the summer, well below the five-year average. Copernicus Senior Scientist Freja Vamborg said that “dry conditions from previous months combined with high temperatures and low precipitation rates seen in many areas during July may have adverse effects on agricultural production and other industries such as river transport and energy production.” Months with little rain In July, water reservoirs in several parts of Europe were at a very low levels, insufficient to sustain demand, according to Copernicus. Southern England experienced its driest July since records began in 1836, while the month across the United Kingdom was the driest July in more than 20 years. The UK saw just 46.3mm, or 56%, of its average rainfall for the month following a long run of drier-than-average months, with the exception of February. In France, July saw a total rainfall of 9.7mm, which made it the driest July there since records began in 1959 and represented a rainfall deficit of 85% compared to the 1991-2020 average. Meanwhile, in Italy, a lack of rain since December 2021 has hit northern parts of the country and the Po River completely dried up in places earlier this summer. In mid-July at Cremona – around halfway along the Po – the water was more than 8 meters below “hydrographic zero,” impacting hydroenergy production, agriculture and transport.  Copernicus said the situation improved as a result of rainfall towards the end of the month, which brought a 40cm increase for the river, although hydropower production in the region was still affected. July was also globally one of three warmest recorded, close to 0.4 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average, and the sixth-hottest July in Europe, Copernicus said.  Spain, France and the United Kingdom experienced at least one day over 40 degrees Celsius last month. In the UK, temperatures climbed to over over 40 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) on July 19 with the English village of Coningsby recording 40.3C for the first time ever.  Meanwhile, Spain reported its hottest July in over 60 years on Monday.  “July 2022 has been extremely hot in Spain, the warmest since at least 1961, with an average temperature of 25.6 ºC [78.1 Fahrenheit], which is 2.7 ºC [4.9 Fahrenheit] higher than the normal average,” the country’s national weather agency AEMET said in a post on Twitter. July was “0.2 ºC [0.4 Fahrenheit] higher than that of July 2015, which until now was the warmest month of July,” it added.

520,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/albuquerque-muslim-men-killings-monday/,"The potentially linked ambush-style shootings of three Muslim men and the recent killing of a fourth in Albuquerque have alarmed the city’s Muslim community, leaving the community grappling with fear as police announce they have detained a suspect. The killings of Mohammad Ahmadi, 62, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, 27, Aftab Hussein, 41, and Naeem Hussain, 25, all have one commonality: the victims were all Muslim and of South Asian descent, according to Albuquerque police. The three most recent killings happened within the span of two weeks, putting the city on edge as police probed for potential links between the attacks, and put a spotlight on an unsolved homicide from November 2021.  Albuquerque police announced Tuesday they had arrested 51-year-old Muhammad Syed, who they described as the “primary suspect” and the driver of a dark silver sedan-style vehicle authorities previously described as a “vehicle of interest.”  The suspect is being charged with two of the homicides: the July 26 killing of Aftab Hussein and the August 1 killing of Muhammad Afzaal Hussain. The FBI is assisting with the investigation, and an online portal was set up for residents to upload videos and images which might help authorities investigating the killings. The local Crime Stoppers Board has also voted to increase a reward for information leading to an arrest to $20,000. “While we are still sifting through all the evidence to look for more connections, it is deeply troubling that these three men were Muslim and of similar descent,” deputy commander of Albuquerque Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division, Kyle Hartsock, previously said. Here’s what we know about the killings and the investigation so far: How did the killings happen? The most recent of the killings was reported Friday, when Naeem Hussain was found dead by Albuquerque police officers who responded to reports of a shooting just before midnight in the area of Truman Street and Grand Avenue. After the discovery, Albuquerque police said the homicide “may be connected” to three previous killings of Muslim men from South Asia. Those three men – Muhammad Afzaal Hussain, Aftab Hussein and Mohammad Ahmadi – were all “ambushed with no warning, fired on and killed,” Hartsock previously said. Two of them, Muhammad Afzaal Hussain and Aftab Hussein, were both Pakistani men and were killed in Southeast Albuquerque near Central Avenue. Police said they “determined there is a connection” between those two deaths. On August 1, police got a call about a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Cornell Drive and Garfield Avenue. They found Muhammad Afzaal Hussain with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a criminal complaint obtained from CNN affiliate KOAT. On July 26, police responded to Rhode Island Street where they found Aftab Hussein with multiple gunshot wounds, lying next to a car. Detectives learned that the gunman had waited behind a bush near the driveway where the victim usually parks his vehicle and then fired through the bush multiple times when Hussein got out of his vehicle,  the complaint states. Police found that casings from both the August 1 and July 26 shootings were likely fired from the same firearm, according to Hartsock. As investigators probed those two recent killings, they turned their attention to the November 7, 2021, homicide of Mohammad Ahmadi, a Muslim man from Afghanistan who was killed outside a business he ran with his brother on San Mateo Boulevard. Who are the victims? Naeem Hussain migrated as a refugee from Pakistan in 2016 – fleeing persecution as a Shia Muslim – and had just become a US citizen last month, according to his brother-in-law, Ehsan Shahalami. He opened his own trucking business this year and was described as being a kind, generous and hardworking person. The day he was killed, he had attended a funeral for the two recent victims and expressed fear about the shootings, according to a spokesman with a mosque in Albuquerque. Muhammad Afzaal Hussain worked on the planning team for the city of Española. He had studied law and human resource management at the University of Punjab in Pakistan before receiving both master’s and bachelor degrees in community and regional planning from the University of New Mexico, according to a news release from the mayor. “Muhammad was soft-spoken and kind, and quick to laugh,” Mayor John Ramon Vigil said in a news release last Wednesday. “He was well-respected and well-liked by his coworkers and members of the community.” Few details have been released about the two other victims. Police said Mohammad Ahmadi was a Muslim man from Afghanistan and Aftab Hussein was a Muslim man from Pakistan. Where does the investigation stand? Prior to the news Tuesday that a suspect had been detained, police had only released a flyer showing a “vehicle of interest” in all four killings. But it remained unclear who the car belongs to, or how they are potentially connected to the attacks. Police said the vehicle “is suspected as being used as a conveyance in recent homicides of 4 Muslim men.”  “We have a very, very strong lead. We have a vehicle of interest … we have got to find this vehicle,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller previously said. “We don’t know at this point what it is associated with, or who owns it.” While police have not definitively said all four attacks are connected, they have said they are looking into whether it is the case. “There is one strong commonality in all the victims; the race and religion,” Hartsock said in a Thursday briefing. Authorities are asking the public to come forward with any information which might help in the investigation. Tips may be submitted to the Albuquerque Metro CrimeStoppers website. Authorities are still searching for a motive behind the killings and working to confirm whether they’re all related.  Syed is now being charged with two of the homicides – of Aftab Hussein and Muhammad Afzaal Hussain – and police said there is evidence “strong enough that” authorities are continuing to view Syed as the “most likely person of interest or suspect” in the other two killings as well, Hartsock said. How are local and national leaders responding? After Friday’s killing, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Saturday she would send additional state police to Albuquerque. “I am angered and saddened that this is happening in New Mexico, a place that prides itself on diversity of culture and thought. This is not who we are,” Grisham said in a statement. “We will not stop in our pursuit of justice for the victims and their families and are bringing every resource to bear to apprehend the killer or killers – and we WILL find them.” The attacks have drew condemnation from President Joe Biden, who said he was “angered and saddened” by the attacks.  Meanwhile, local and national Muslim groups had warned residents to be cautious. “We urge everyone to take precautions and be aware of your surroundings including making sure that you are not being followed home and avoid walking alone at night,” Islamic Center of New Mexico posted on Facebook. “This is especially true for our members living in the southeast part of the city where these killings have taken place.” The center said while there was no evidence its mosque is being targeted, it was still taking steps to provide additional security measures. “The lives of Albuquerque Muslims are in danger. Whoever is responsible for this horrific, hateful shooting spree must be identified and stopped – now,” stressed Council on American-Islamic Relations National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell. The Council was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of those responsible, the organization announced, calling the series of killings a “horrific, hateful shooting spree.” CNN’s Claudia Dominguez and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",Edward Ahmed Mitchell;Albuquerque Metro Crimestoppers;Michelle Lujan Grisham;Ehsan Shahalami;Joe Biden;Aftab

64,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/dc-man-impersonating-dhs-agent-pleads-guilty/,"Arian Taherzadeh, a Washington, DC man who impersonated a Department of Homeland Security agent while prosecutors say he ingratiated himself with federal agents through gifts and rent-free apartments, pleaded guilty on Monday and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department. The case, which put four Secret Service members on administrative leave and involved years of deception, according to court documents, continued to crystallize Monday as new charges and information were revealed during the plea hearing. Taherzadeh, along with his co-defendant Haider Ali, were charged earlier this year with falsely impersonating federal officers and possessing illegal, large capacity ammo magazines. Both men were released on home incarceration in April. Ali has pleaded not guilty.  Taherzadeh was charged with conspiring to impersonate a federal law enforcement officer as well as possession of an illegal, large-capacity ammo magazine and filming individuals, without their consent, engaging in sexual activity. He pleaded guilty to the three charges and, as part of his plea, agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department in its investigation. He faces 37 to 46 months behind bars, according to sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors alleged that Taherzadeh, Ali and a third, unnamed individual, duped federal agents, including members of the Secret Service, by ingratiating themselves with the agents by giving them gifts and rent-free apartments. One agent, who Taherzadeh offered to purchase an expensive rifle for, was on the first lady’s protective detail at the time, according to court documents.   The group never paid for the luxury apartments they rented in DC and were evicted from several buildings, racking up more than $800,000 in unpaid rent, fees and parking, according to prosecutors. Using fictitious individuals as their “supervisors,” Taherzadeh would tell the apartment buildings that the government would be paying their rent and blamed government bureaucracy and their fake bosses for unpaid bills, court documents say.  According to the plea agreement, which was read aloud during Monday’s hearing, Taherzadeh also worked to recruit other individuals to his fake Homeland Security Investigations force he said was under DHS.  Taherzadeh made up false acts of heroism as part of these efforts to recruit others and falsely claimed he had been an Army Ranger and an Air Marshal.  As part of the recruitment process, one individual was shot with an air rifle by Taherzadeh, who said on Monday that the two would shoot each other, adding that it was “something we did kind of as a drinking game.”  Taherzadeh also said that he set up a security camera in his bedroom and filmed women engaging in sexual activity without their consent, videos which he showed others. The men also used their fake personas to get access to security footage from the apartment they were living in, according to prosecutors. Taherzadeh also has agreed to testify in any trial or grand jury related to his crimes as part of the plea deal and will appear before the court in November for a status update on his cooperation.

14,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/kentucky-appalachia-flooding-monday/,"The death toll in flood-stricken Kentucky has risen to 37, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday afternoon, as rescue workers continue to comb the region for hundreds of missing people, unable to access areas left isolated after floodwater washed away bridges and inundated communities.  “We are ending the day with more heartbreaking news out of Eastern Kentucky. We can confirm the death toll has now risen to 37, with so many more still missing,” Beshear tweeted late Monday afternoon. “Let us pray for these families and come together to wrap our arms around our fellow Kentuckians.” The death toll could still rise further, according to officials, with “hundreds of unaccounted for people” at a minimum, the governor said at a news conference earlier in the day in Frankfort.  “We just don’t have a firm grasp on that. I wish we did – there are a lot of reasons why it’s nearly impossible,” he said. “But I want to make sure we’re not giving either false hope or faulty information.” The flooding last week swelled over roads, destroyed bridges and swept away entire homes, displacing thousands of Kentuckians, Beshear previously said. Vital electricity, water and roadway infrastructure was also knocked out. Some of it has yet to be restored, though cell service is returning in some of the state’s hardest-hit areas,  the governor said, which may help people connect with loved ones they’ve yet to contact. “I’ve lived here in this town for 56 years, and I have never seen water of this nature,” Tracy Neice, the mayor of Hindman, Kentucky, told CNN, saying his town’s main street looked like a stretch of river where one might go whitewater rafting. “It was just devastating to all of our businesses, all of our offices.” While reading a breakdown of those killed in each county during a news conference Sunday, Beshear became visibly emotional when he reached four children dead in Knott County. They were identified to CNN by their aunt as siblings Chance, 2; Nevaeh, 4; Riley Jr., 6; and Madison, 8. “It says ‘minors,’” the governor said looking at the list. “They are children. The oldest one is in second grade,” Beshear said.  The children – described as sweet, funny and lovable – died after the family’s mobile home flooded last week, forcing them to seek shelter on the roof, their aunt, Brandi Smith, told CNN on Friday.  “They were holding on to them,” Smith said of her sister and her partner. “The water got so strong it just washed them away.”  Sixteen of the deaths occurred in Knott County, about 130 miles southeast of Lexington, per the governor’s office. Seven people were killed in Breathitt County, two in Clay County, two in Letcher County and three in Perry County.   The governor believes recovery crews are “going to be finding bodies for weeks,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, “many of them swept hundreds of yards, maybe a quarter-mile plus from where they were last.” More rain in the forecast Officials are “still in search and rescue mode,” Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman told CNN on Monday, “because there is so much water.”  “All of our state roads are passable,” she said, but “we still have back roads and country roads that are broken off, and our bridges are out. So it’s really difficult to get to some of the most remote places.”  In Perry County, as many as 50 bridges are damaged and inaccessible, according to county Judge Executive Scott Alexander.   “What that means is there’s somebody living on the other side or multiple families living up our holler on the other side that we’re still not able to have road access to,” Alexander said. Things could get more difficult due to a slight risk of excessive rainfall throughout the region Monday, the National Weather Service said, and with the ground already saturated, more rain could bring yet more flooding.  “If things weren’t hard enough on the people in this region, they’re getting rain right now,” Beshear said Monday.  A flood watch will be in effect overnight, lasting from 9 p.m. Monday to 9 a.m. Tuesday. Forecasts predict thunderstorms and potential rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. Heavy downpours could cause excessive runoff and “result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,” said the weather service. Temperatures are expected to rise later this week, hitting the mid-80s and near 90 on Wednesday and Thursday, per the weather service, but it will feel much hotter because of the humidity. The heat indices – the temperature it feels like when heat is combined with humidity – are expected to peak around 100 degrees in some places, leaving rescue crews and displaced people facing oppressive heat as more than 14,000 customers remain without power. As the climate crisis fuels more frequent extreme weather events, several areas of the US are currently experiencing flash flood risk, including swathes of the desert Southwest, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Tucson, Arizona.   Region in desperate need of resources Meantime, state officials are immediately focused on getting food, water and shelter to the people who were forced to flee their homes.  Power outages and storm damage left 22 water systems operating in a limited capacity, a Sunday news release from the governor’s office said. More than 60,000 water service connections are either without water or under a boil advisory, it said.  Officials overseeing the recovery efforts say bottled water, cleaning supplies and relief fund donations are among the most needed resources as the region works toward short- and long-term recovery. FEMA is providing tractor trailers full of water to several counties.  “A lot of these places have never flooded. So if they’ve never flooded, these people will not have flood insurance,” the mayor of Hazard, Kentucky, Donald Mobelini told CNN on Saturday. “If they lose their home, it’s total loss. There’s not going to be an insurance check coming to help that. We need cash donations,” he said, referring to a relief fund set up by the state. Among those without flood insurance is Jessica Willett, a mother who tied herself to her two children using a cord she cut off her vacuum.  “I thought I could try to save us,” she told CNN Monday. “Or, you know, if we didn’t make it, then we could be found all together.”  Willett had no warning when the flooding began, she said. She heard some noises and when she opened her door, the water was there. Eventually, the house was swept off its foundation, and washed about a hundred feet down the road, Willett estimated.  The family finally escaped around 3 or 4 a.m., when Willett left her children and ventured out to wade through the water running across the road to see how deep it was. Once she knew she could get through safely, she went back for them.  Asked what she’ll do next, Willett said, “I don’t know.” “We have insurance but we don’t have flood insurance,” she said, holding back tears. “Because we weren’t in a flood zone. So I don’t know what to do.” Beshear established a Team Eastern Kentucky Flood Relief Fund to pay the funeral expenses of flood victims and raise money for those impacted by the damage. As of Sunday morning, the fund had received more than $1 million in donations, according to the governor. The federal government has approved relief funding for several counties. FEMA is also accepting individual disaster assistance applications from impacted renters and homeowners in Breathitt, Clay, Knott, Letcher and Perry counties, the governor said. On Monday he requested a number of other impacted counties be made eligible.  Beshear believes the losses will be “in the tens if not the hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said over the weekend. The extensive loss Kentuckians are suffering will likely also take a mental toll, Frances Everage, a therapist and 44-year resident of the city of Hazard told CNN. While her home was spared, she said some of her friends have damaged homes or lost their entire farms.  “When you put your blood, sweat and tears into something and then see it ripped away in front of your eyes, there’s going to be a grieving process,” Everage said. “This community will rebuild and we will be okay, but the impact on mental health is going to be significant.” CNN’s Sara Smart, Andy Rose, Lauren Lee, Raja Razek, Mike Valerio, Mark Biello, Cole Higgins, Robert Shackelford, Chris Boyette, Aya Elamroussi, Dakine Andone, Caitlin Kaiser and Tom Sater contributed to this report.

156,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/tech/musk-twitter-subpoenas/,"Twitter has subpoenaed a number of Elon Musk’s associates, according to court filings and public statements, as the company moves forward with its legal fight against the Tesla billionaire over his attempt to terminate their $44 billion acquisition deal. The list of those who have received subpoenas includes several prominent investment firms and venture capitalists, some of whom are part of the so-called PayPal mafia, a group of influential figures in the tech industry who worked at the payment company cofounded by Musk. According to a court filing, Twitter sent a subpoena to Founders Fund, a San Francisco-based VC firm established by Peter Thiel, the controversial billionaire who was also a cofounder at PayPal. Twitter is also said to have sent subpoenas to investors Joe Lonsdale and David Sacks, according to tweets from both individuals.  Lonsdale, a cofounder of Palantir and former PayPal employee, claimed in a tweet this week that his subpoena is part of a “giant harassing fishing expedition.” Sacks, a former PayPal exec and founder of Yammer, responded to the subpoena by tweeting a magazine cover with an image of a middle finger on it. Twitter declined to comment for this story. Musk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement last month, alleging that Twitter breached the deal by failing to hand over data he says he needs to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform. Days later, Twitter sued Musk to force him to follow through with the deal. A five-day trial is set to begin in Delaware on October 17 after Twitter pushed for an expedited process. By sending out subpoenas to investors and associates of Musk, Twitter could be trying to determine when the Tesla CEO decided to back out of the deal and his motive in doing so. “They’re trying to verify his story,” Charles Elson, founding director of Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, told CNN Business. “Was he really misled? Was he not? Was this a strategy, or was this a genuine concern about what they had told him or didn’t tell him?” Some analysts have suggested that Musk is using the bot explanation as an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in Twitter shares and the overall tech market. Tesla shares, which Musk is relying on in part to finance the deal, also declined after he agreed to the acquisition. (A lawyer for Musk has previously called that suggestion “nonsense.”)  Prior to moving to terminate the deal, Musk had lined up financing for the acquisition, including debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions as well as billions in equity financing from various tech investment firms.  According to a court filing, Twitter sent a subpoena to AH Capital Investments, a fund from Andreessen Horowitz, which was among the firms listed as agreeing to provide equity financing for the deal. Founders Fund and AH Capital Investments were not available for immediate comment.  Twitter also sent subpoenas to two of Musk’s companies, Tesla and SpaceX, according to court filings.

Over 100 million Americans have been under heat alerts for eight of the last 16 days, according to NOAA’s heat.gov site and now the heat will build eastward through the end of the week. More than 80% of the US population will experience temperatures over 90 degrees within the next week, including the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Heat indexes, the apparent temperature of your skin when humidity is factored, will range from 95 to 100 degrees for NYC and up to 105 degrees for Washington, Baltimore and Boston. Adding to the misery, overnight lows will struggle to drop below 75-80 degrees, limiting the body’s ability to cool off at night. Boston mayor declares a heat emergency for the city Mayor Michelle Wu declared a heat emergency for Boston lasting from Thursday through Sunday ahead of a four-day stretch with sizzling temperatures in the Northeast heading into the weekend. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a heat advisory for Boston that will start Thursday at 11 a.m., according to a tweet Monday. The heat index in the Boston area is expected to cross into triple-digit temperatures Thursday and Friday, reaching as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit Thursday and 101 degrees Friday, according to the NWS. The heat index will dip back down into the 90s during the weekend with forecast highs of 94 and 99 degrees on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. “We’re working quickly to make sure all of our Boston residents and families are protected during this week’s extremely hot weather,” Wu said in a release Wednesday. “I urge everyone to stay cool and safe and check on your neighbors during the week.” The release states that 16 cooling centers will open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Sunday at Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF) locations, where mask-wearing is “strongly recommended” due to rising Covid-19 cases. Pools will also be available at some of the BCYF community centers, according to the release. Public library locations will also offer cool spaces in addition to splash pads, and outdoor water play areas, which will be available at Boston parks and playgrounds, the release states.

492,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/media/alex-jones-trial-reliable-sources/,"The Texas jury’s decision last week to have Alex Jones face punitive damages of more than $45 million in a lawsuit filed by the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victim Jesse Lewis was a “reckoning that was 10 years in the making,” CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said.  A pair of Chicago-based podcast hosts have spent the past 5 years holding Jones and his Infowars network accountable. Their program, Knowledge Fight, has produced more than 700 episodes, and uses comedy to “cut through crazy lies,” Stelter said on Reliable Sources Sunday.   Hosts Dan Friesen and Jordan Holmes traveled to Texas to witness Jones’ trial first hand.  Friesen said the most powerful moment inside the courtroom was watching Jesse Lewis’ mom Scarlett Lewis give her testimony and speak directly to Jones. “I think it will stay with pretty much everyone there for the rest of their lives,” Friesen said.  The co-hosts have been covering Jones since 2017, watching his transformation from a seemingly untouchable figure to one that is now in serious legal and financial jeopardy.  “During this whole stretch of time, his content itself has been essentially hollow,” Friesen said. “Watching him from my perspective has gotten a lot less interesting.” But despite Jones’ legal woes, Holmes said that the culture he’s helped engender has gotten a lot bigger. “Conspiracy culture is something that is created through the cracks of our regular society,” Holmes said.  And although their podcast focuses on scrutinizing Jones and his tactics, Holmes said the trial was really about the victims. “People would like to focus on Alex being kind of a bombastic character that we can mock and make fun of, but this isn’t about him,” Holmes said.  The podcast format allows the hosts to go beyond Jones as a character and dive into the mechanisms of what he’s doing and why these conspiracy narratives exist.  “We approach it with the understanding that it’s a serious topic,” Friesen said. “But also that in order to make it interesting for anybody to listen to, we have to make it make something entertaining.”  Friesen has listened to countless hours of Jones’ program, and calls it an “incredibly boring experience.” “The reason that I do this is because I can stomach that boredom,” Friesen said. He endures the task in order to help others get insights into the misinformation phenomenon. “So they could be in a place where they could better understand what Alex is doing and what he brings to the table.”  Many hope that the legal and financial jeopardy Jones’ is now facing will help curtail misinformation and conspiracy culture. But Friesen isn’t convinced it will be a severe blow.  “The conspiracy producers and people who engage in the sorts of conduct that Alex does end up becoming a little bit savvier,” Friesen said. “They end up learning where the lines are … of what they can do and what they can get away with.”  ",Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Jesse Lewi;Brian Stelter;Scarlett Lewis;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Alex Jones;Jesse Lewis;Dan Friesen,Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,244;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,1891;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,1891;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1891;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,1891;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,250;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,250;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,250;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,86;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,655;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,812;TAX_FNCACT_CORRESPONDENT,264;TRIAL,27;TRIAL,567;TRIAL,724;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,179;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,717;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,874;TRANSPARENCY,409;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,1119;",Sandy Hook;New York;Chicago;Texas,615
379,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/lawrence-rudolph-guilty-safari-murder-cec/,"An American dentist and big-game hunter was found guilty of murder in the shooting death of his wife on an African safari. Lawrence Rudolph, 67, killed his wife, Bianca Rudolph, with a shotgun and defrauded multiple  insurance companies, a federal jury found Monday. Rudolph cashed in more than $4.8 million in life insurance payments after her death almost six years ago. Rudolph has maintained his innocence and said he believes the gun fired accidentally. “I did not kill my wife. I could not murder my wife. I would not murder my wife,” Rudolph told jurors when he took the stand in his own defense at a federal trial in Denver last week.  The Phoenix couple shared a passion for big-game hunting, and had traveled to the southern African nation of Zambia in September 2016 so Bianca Rudolph could add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. Two weeks later, as Bianca Rudolph was packing for the couple’s return home, she suffered a fatal blast from the Browning shotgun in their hunting cabin at Kafue National Park. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot at dawn while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents said. He told investigators he found her bleeding on the floor.   But federal prosecutors at Rudolph’s trial in Denver, where the insurance companies are based, described it as a premeditated crime. Prosecutors argued Rudolph killed his wife of 30 years for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend, Lori Milliron. Defense attorney David Markus had argued that Larry Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In court documents, he noted that Rudolph owns a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million.  “We are obviously extremely disappointed. We believe in Larry and his children,” Markus and fellow defense attorneys Margot Moss and Lauren Doyle told CNN in a statement after Monday’s verdict. “There are lots of really strong appellate issues, which we will be pursuing after we have had a chance to regroup.” The jury also found Milliron, Rudolph’s girlfriend, guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder, obstruction of justice and two counts of perjury based on her testimony before a grand jury, according to the Department of Justice.  Milliron, who was tried alongside Rudolph, said the couple had been in an open relationship, according to court documents. Milliron and Rudolph lived together from 2017 until his arrest last year, her attorney, John Dill, told CNN. “We are disappointed in the jury’s verdict, but that is our system,” Dill said. “Lori Milliron is innocent and we will continue to fight to exonerate her.”  An embassy official expressed suspicion after the shooting, the FBI said  In court documents, investigators alleged Rudolph raised suspicions when he sought to quickly cremate his wife’s body in Zambia. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge.  Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. But forensic evidence showed Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint said. US Attorney Cole Finegan welcomed the jury’s ruling. “Bianca Rudolph deserved justice,” Finegan said in a statement. “We can only hope this verdict brings Bianca’s family some amount of peace.”   A friend of Bianca Rudolph’s asked the FBI to investigate  But federal investigators maintained the shooting was premeditated so that Rudolph “could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleged.   Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of Bianca Rudolph asked the FBI to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Larry Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death.  Milliron worked as a manager at Larry Rudolph’s dental practice near Pittsburgh and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, according to court documents. Milliron moved in with Rudolph three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, court documents said.

187,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/carolyn-maloney-biden-reelection/,"Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York said Tuesday evening she doesn’t believe President Joe Biden will run for reelection in 2024, the latest Democrat to publicly cast doubt on a second Biden term. “I don’t believe he’s running for reelection,” Maloney said when asked if the President should run again during a congressional primary debate in New York’s 12th district.  Responding to the same question, Rep. Jerry Nadler, who is running against Maloney following redistricting, said it’s “too early to say” and that it “doesn’t serve the purpose of the Democratic Party” to deal with the question until after midterms. Maloney’s other opponent, Suraj Patel, simply answered, “Yes.”  Democrats have privately shared concerns about Biden, who is 79 and struggling with poor approval ratings, running for a second term in the 2024 election. The President and his aides have pushed back on any idea that he won’t run for a second term, and most Democrats have publicly said they will support Biden if he runs for a second term. Maloney told CNN on Wednesday that if Biden runs for reelection, she will back him. “If he decides to run, I’m supporting him. I’m supporting him and I don’t have other comment,” Maloney said over the phone. “I think that he’s done a terrific job and most recently the inflation reduction plan. There are so many good things in it for the economy and for people. And I’m supporting him if he runs. OK?” Pressed again on why she had said she didn’t believe Biden would run for reelection, Maloney reiterated: “I’m supporting him, if he runs. OK?” A CNN poll out last month found 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than Biden in the 2024 election, a sharp increase from earlier this year. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota went further than Maloney in an interview last week, stating he doesn’t want Biden to run for president in 2024. “I have respect for Joe Biden. I think he has – despite some mistakes and some missteps, despite his age, I think he’s a man of decency, of good principle, of compassion, of empathy, and of strength. But to answer your question directly, which I know is quite rare, uh no, I don’t,” Phillips said an interview on the Chad Hartman radio show on WCCO-AM. “I think the country would be well served by a new generation of compelling, well-prepared, dynamic Democrats to step up,” Phillips added.  This story has been updated with additional comments from Maloney. CNN’s MJ Lee and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.

216,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/europe/prince-charles-donation-money-bin-laden-intl/,"Clarence House, the residence of Prince Charles, has disputed claims reported in the UK’s Sunday Times that the heir to the throne brokered a deal in 2013 to accept a £1 million charity donation from Osama bin Laden’s half-brothers. The Sunday Times, citing unnamed sources, reported that Prince Charles accepted the donation from Bakr bin Laden and Shafiq bin Laden for The Prince of Wales’ Charitable Fund (PWCF) despite objections from key advisers at the time.  Clarence House disputed that assertion on Saturday, saying the decision to accept the money was made by the charity’s Trustees, and not Prince Charles. “The Prince of Wales’ Charitable Fund has assured us that thorough due diligence was undertaken in accepting this donation,” the Clarence House statement said. “The decision to accept was taken by the charity’s Trustees alone and any attempt to characterize it otherwise is false.”  Bakr bin Laden is the former chairman of the Jeddah-based construction company Saudi Binladin Group. Osama bin Laden was removed as a shareholder from the family company in 1993, when Bakr bin Laden was chairman, US court documents show.  Osama Bin Laden was the leader of al Qaeda when the network carried out the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001. He was killed by US special forces in an operation 10 years later. Neither Bakr or Shafiq bin Laden have any known ties to terrorist activities or appear on any counter-terror sanctions lists issued by the United Nations or the governments of the US, EU and the UK. According to the Sunday Times report, Prince Charles secured the funds after a meeting with Bakr bin Laden, and accepted the donation, despite the “initial objection of advisers at Clarence House” and the PWCF.   PWCF also responded to the Sunday Times’ report saying that “the donation from Sheik Bakr Bin Laden was carefully considered by PWCF Trustees. Due diligence was conducted, with information sought from a wide range of sources, including government.” A royal source told CNN that they disputed The Sunday Times’ claims that Prince Charles personally accepted the donation, that he brokered the deal and that advisors around Prince Charles pleaded for him to return the money at the time. A source close to PWCF said that “after a thorough examination of the issues, the Trustees concluded that the actions of one Bin Laden family member should not tarnish the whole family.” The Sunday Times reported in June that Prince Charles had accepted charitable donations in the form of cash from Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar, between 2011 and 2015. Clarence House also disputed the details of the June report and said that the “correct processes” were followed in terms of accepting the donation.",,Saudi Binladin Group;Prince Of Wale Charitable Fund;Prince Of Wale Charitable Fund;United Nations;Cnn,"GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1982;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1982;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,938;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1123;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,459;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISERS,1704;LEADER,2589;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,2589;TERROR,1383;ARMEDCONFLICT,1383;TAX_TERROR_GROUP_AL_QAEDA,1195;TAX_FNCACT_LEADER,1183;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,984;KILL,1270;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1270;SANCTIONS,1434;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,41;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,309;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,393;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,615;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,637;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,1572;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,2062;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,2161;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,2451;MILITARY,1291;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,2589;",United Kingdom;Jeddah;New York;Qatar,567
52,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/americas/mexico-miners-sabinas-intl-latam/,"Ten miners have been trapped in a flooded coal mine in northern Mexico for over 24 hours, as rescuers battle to reach them. The incident was reported Wednesday afternoon, when the miners encountered an abandoned tunnel with water that flooded the mine, authorities said. Rescuers managed to extract five people from the mine on Wednesday, and are now working to pump water out of the flooded area, according to National Coordinator of Civil Protection, Laura Velazquez, who is overseeing the rescue operation. “We have not slept, we are working day and night, uninterrupted,” said Velazquez on Thursday. “We are strategically putting pumps in each of these wells to be able to extract the greatest amount of water and have immediate access to the mines and rescue the miners as soon as possible,” she said. Early on Thursday morning, six special forces divers joined the rescue operations, General Agustin Radilla said. There has been no update on their findings as of yet, however. “They say the water is rising…I want my husband to come out all right,” said the wife of one trapped miner, Erika Escobedo, to Reuters. She told the news agency that she had spent “all night watching rescue efforts at the site.” Governor Miguel Riquelme, of Coahuila and Zaragoza state, traveled on Thursday to the municipality of Sabinas where the mine is located. “Five water extraction pumps totaling 150 horsepower are currently working and other submersible pumps are being installed, which are being sent by companies in the region and thus continue with the rescue efforts,” he wrote on Twitter.  Sabinas is no stranger to mining tragedies. In 2006, an explosion in a local mine killed 65 people. In 2011, 14 miners were trapped and confirmed dead following another mine blast in Sabinas.   According a statement released by Mexico’s Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare, the mine where the ten are currently trapped only began operations in January, and “does not have a history of complaints for any type of anomaly.” In his daily press briefing on Thursday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said any investigation into the mine would come only after the rescue operation had concluded. “Those responsible, the permits, the inspections, everything, all of that, we are leaving until after. We already have the basic information,” he said.  “But let’s not talk about that now, let’s look to save the miners.” Reporting contributed by Daniela Gonzalez-Roman in New York City and Karol Suarez in Mexico City.

337,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/texas-uvalde-shooting-dps-arrival/,"Body camera footage released by the city of Uvalde last month shows a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper was on the scene outside Robb Elementary School just 2 minutes and 28 seconds after the gunman entered, a timeline earlier than previously known. The department had only disclosed, in timelines and testimony, that the first state trooper entered the school hallway at 11:42 a.m., nine minutes after the gunman entered the school. But DPS had not stated when the trooper first arrived at the school itself. The more specific timeline raises further questions about DPS’s own transparency and role in the botched police response, even as the department leads the investigation into what happened. The body camera video was provided to CNN by Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, who has expressed his frustration with the department’s investigation and accused DPS of a “cover-up.” The head of the largest police union in Texas said the new timeline raised serious questions about the department’s trustworthiness. “I don’t know that we can trust them to do an internal investigation,” Charley Wilkison, the executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which represents some law enforcement officers in Uvalde, told CNN on Tuesday. “It would be best if the investigation were headed up by an outside independent source that the public can have total confidence in. “I would say that DPS was fast to wash its hands, to point fingers and to make sure that the general public, particularly the elected officials, knew that they were spotless, blameless and that this was a local problem,” he added. The new reporting comes more than two months after an 18-year-old gunman entered the school, opened fire inside two adjoining classrooms and slaughtered 19 children and two teachers. Officers arrived on the scene minutes later, but after taking fire from the gunman, they retreated to a hallway, and the gunman remained inside the classrooms for a total of 77 minutes before a tactical unit forced their way in and killed him, according to a timeline from the public safety department. The long delay contradicts a widely taught protocol for active shooter situations, which says that law enforcement should stop the gunman as fast as possible. Yet authorities have repeatedly offered conflicting timelines and muddled explanations as to what happened in that period. In June, DPS Director Col. Steven McCraw called the law enforcement response an “abject failure” in testimony before the Texas Senate. He placed sole blame for the delayed response on the on-scene commander, Uvalde School Police Chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo. “The only thing stopping the hallway of dedicated officers from entering rooms 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander, who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children.” Arredondo has said he did not consider himself to be in command that day, but body camera videos and other documents undermine that claim and show him giving orders and conveying and receiving information. The school district’s superintendent placed him on administrative leave in late June. What the body camera video shows The body camera video shows the hectic scene in the moments after the shooting as law enforcement raced to the school. The gunman entered the school at 11:33:00 a.m., according to the official Texas DPS timeline. In the body camera video, the Texas state trooper is seen running on the street leading to one of the entrances of the school at 11:35:28. While the image of the trooper is difficult to make out in the distance, closer images of the trooper can be seen in the minutes that follow as the trooper gets closer to the police officer wearing the body camera. At 11:36:01 the trooper is seen taking cover behind a vehicle and a second later the trooper is seen running toward one of the entrances of the school. At 11:40:32, the body camera video shows that the state trooper was at the east entrance of the building. Just over a minute later, the trooper is seen on body camera video inside the building at 11:41:44. The official timeline released by DPS noted that a Texas DPS trooper entered the east hallway at 11:42:24, but did not mention when the trooper first arrived outside the school. In his testimony to the Texas Senate, McCraw also revealed that a trooper was in the hallway at 11:42 but did not mention when the trooper arrived on scene. According to DPS, McCraw’s testimony only included the troopers who entered the building, with arrival times expected to be included in a detailed final report. “The timeline from the Director’s testimony was limited to officers entering the West building and that information was based on enhanced interior school surveillance footage and limited body camera coverage,” Texas DPS spokesperson Ericka Miller said in a statement. Miller added that the investigation is ongoing and investigators are working to synchronize body camera footage with the timeline of events.  Miller also said that state trooper Sgt. Juan Maldonado was among the first officers to arrive on the scene, accompanied by Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Officer Ruben Ruiz.

295,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/private-astronaut-mission-new-requirements/,"Private astronaut missions to the International Space Station will have to be chaperoned by a former NASA astronaut, per new proposed requirements from the US space agency.  NASA posted a public notice online on Tuesday that laid out a handful of updated requirements for future private astronaut missions, which the agency said are based on lessons learned upon completion of the first private astronaut mission to the ISS that took place last April. The first all-private mission to the orbiting laboratory was a multi-million dollar journey organized by Texas-based startup Axiom Space and launched via a SpaceX rocket, with a crew comprised of a former NASA astronaut and current Axiom Space employee, Michael López-Alegría, and three ultra-wealthy paying crewmembers. During the mission, dubbed AX-1, the four-member crew spent nearly two weeks off of Earth’s surface, at least in part conducting experiments and other scientific work. Other space tourism companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic only offer customers short trips that allow for a few minutes of microgravity. Among the most notable new policies for these pricey, private missions to the ISS is that “upcoming private astronaut missions include a former flown NASA (U.S.) government astronaut as the mission commander,” according to the NASA update.  The requirement is still being finalized, NASA added, but the agency noted that having a former, legitimate astronaut “provides experienced guidance for the private astronauts during pre-flight preparation through mission execution.” The former NASA astronaut also “provides a link” between residents on the ISS and the private astronauts, which the agency said “reduces risk” to ISS operations and safety.  Late last year, SpaceX launched the Inspiration4 mission, which was bankrolled by billionaire Jared Isaacman and had a four-person crew composed entirely of people without any prior spaceflight experience. This private mission, however, simply took a three-day spin around Earth in a SpaceX dragon capsule and did not dock at the ISS.  Axiom has already stated that its second private astronaut mission to the ISS, dubbed AX-2 and expected to launch next year, will have former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson as a mission commander. During remarks at the annual International Space Station Research and Development Conference last week, López-Alegría spoke about how he became mission commander for the AX-1 flight, saying he initially didn’t expect to return to space after retiring from NASA.  When Axiom was looking for customers, however, “It became pretty clear, first of all, that customers really didn’t want to fly with nobody who’d done it before,” he said. It also became apparent, he said, “NASA was a lot more comfortable having someone who’d been there before.”  “We were having a meeting and we looked around the room and I was the only guy who’d been to space, so I raised my hand. I volunteered,” López-Alegría quipped at the conference.  NASA is also adding additional requirements that appear to be a result of new information learned from the AX-1 mission. Future private missions to the space station will include more time for “microgravity adaptation,” as the floating environment of the ISS can often induce space sickness, which is akin to motion sickness.  The federal space agency will also be introducing clarifications to the ISS code of conduct for commercial visitors, requirements for more detailed plans regarding crew interactions with the media, as well as a requirement for additional time to evaluate research proposals before they are brought on board. Larry Connor, an AX-1 crewmember, told CNN in April that he and his crewmates were pressed for research time on the ISS. “If it were not for the NASA’s Crew-3 astronauts, and their phenomenal help, we would never - underscore the word never - have been able to accomplish all of our objectives,” Connor said at the time. “We underestimated the time on some of the projects. We had one project early on that we thought was two-and-a-half hours take five hours.” A NASA rep did not immediately respond to CNN Business’ request for further comment on the new requirements. They come, however, as the private spaceflight industry has officially lifted off after decades of people largely having to rely on government agencies and the extraordinarily selective astronaut hiring process if they wanted to go to space. Now, those who seek to leave Earth’s surface simply must have the means to pay for it.  While Axiom did not publicly disclose how much its first cohort of private astronauts shelled out for the AX-1 mission, the Washington Post reported that each crew member dished out $55 million for the flight.

461,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/kentucky-flooding-survivor-stories/,"With another flood watch in place in eastern Kentucky, people here are hoping and praying for one more miracle.  Some saw it as a miracle they survived the historic flooding more than a week ago. They might feel it could take another to survive the aftermath – the mud and debris of destroyed houses and businesses, the pain of dozens of lives lost and many missing, and the trauma of their experiences. Over the past week, across the now-declared disaster area, survivors have shared harrowing stories with CNN of barely escaping the rushing waters, incredible rescue missions, and desperate attempts to save their families and themselves.   But they also have stories of barely surviving the cruel wake once the water receded – being stranded by washed out roads and bridges, struggling to get food, medicine or water in the early days, being rescued by neighbors.  “We’re not victims here,” said Allen Bormes, police chief for the city of Fleming-Neon, where there’s little left besides debris and mud. “We’re survivors.” More than a week after the flooding, Fleming-Neon Mayor Susan Polis still cries when recalling the devastation she saw in its aftermath. “Well, I wasn’t prepared. But what can you do when your little town is, your little city is devastated? I mean, it was like a war zone,” she said. City Hall is destroyed, leaving officials this week to work out of a camper and a tent over a table set up in a parking lot. The water lines on buildings lining Main Street reach well over 6 feet.  The water and debris broke windows all along the main part of downtown, in shops, the town dental office, churches – nothing was spared. Like many other communities in the region, there isn’t any clean, running water.   “Our vision is to build this back better than it was before, before the rain,” said Bormes. With a catch in his throat, he took a moment to collect his emotions before continuing. “Because these people deserve it. They deserve to have what they had before and more.” Fleming-Neon was nearly impossible to reach in the first days after the flood, so help came from within the community. Polis recalled people being trapped in a holler until neighbors acted.  “They had a bridge to basically disintegrate. And for that night, for the rest of Thursday night and into Friday afternoon, there was no way in and no way out, for those people,” Polis said, “So, some citizens, before all this heavy equipment started coming in – the citizens, they fixed it.” Quick thinking in a close call with death Letcher Fire Chief Wallace Bolling Jr. still can’t believe he lived to tell how he survived the floods. Bolling, who people around town call Spanky, received a call that the fire station in nearby Jeremiah was flooding. He drove his pickup to the station, in part to move vehicles to avoid damage. In hindsight, he admitted the decision wasn’t good.   The water started to rise quickly as he pulled up to the station, trapping him inside his truck, which he said began floating with the current. His only option was to try to steer the truck into an old tanker he had left parked outside the station, he said.  Unable to open the truck’s door or window, “I reached and found my pistol in the back seat, and I shot the window out of my Chevy,” he said. Diving out the window, he made it to safety by climbing on top of the tanker, where he remained for 15 hours as flood waters, downed trees and debris rushed past him. “I had a lot of time to think about a lot of things,” Bolling said. “I found peace. I wasn’t scared. I had a long talk with the Lord.”  While stranded, Bolling texted his mother and father: “I love you, please don’t worry… everything is fine… I love you.” Dealing with post-traumatic stress The Letcher Fire Department was destroyed, with all vehicles damaged. Insurance won’t be enough to cover all the damages, according to Bolling. While Bolling plans to get the station straightened out, he also has to address his own trauma, he said. He hasn’t been able to sleep and often hears water when he closes his eyes. “I’m having a lot of trouble. I’m not going to lie,” he said. He plans to talk to a therapist and hopes others who survived the storm can do the same. “PTSD is real, and I kind of wondered about things, like how to go forward, but you know, I gotta fix myself first,” he said.   But along with the sorrow, there’s pride, too, in the way their Appalachian community has come together, with neighbors who lost everything helping neighbors in the same situation.  Volunteers from all over Appalachia have been sweeping and using small bulldozers to get mud out of buildings this week.  And while proud of their independent and resilient community, officials in Fleming-Neon admit the city is desperate for all the help it can get.  “Our infrastructure needs help from Washington, from Frankfort. We’re going to have to have a lot of help,” Fire Chief Bolling said. Gary Clink, who has lived just outside of Hindman for decades, was rescued, along with his wife and a neighbor, by his son-in-law, he said. Now he’s trying to save his wet furniture from mildew in the muddy interior of his home, which had more than 4 feet of water in it during the flood.  “It’s like someone turned the switch to maximum overdrive,” explained Clink as he sat on the porch looking at what was left of his belongings drying out on the lawn, “I’ve never seen water like that. It’s like a dam burst or a tsunami. “That’s the reason you see garbage wherever you look, houses wrecked. I’ve seen three homes I knew basically lifted up off the foundation base, as they washed down the stream and it ripped them apart.” And he worries that this catastrophe won’t be the last.  “I believe you’re seeing the effects of climate change right here,” Clink said. “Just given time, if we don’t turn it around, just given time, it’s going to get worse.”  Some are also concerned that people will leave the area because the devastation is too extreme. “This is literally the end of this little community,” Clink sighed, “These people, you’ll see a lot of them had decent appliances, decent furniture, decent clothes, but it is no longer decent. “If they didn’t have flood insurance or FEMA can’t step in and actually help… this is the end of the line for this community. I don’t see any way they are going to come back from it.” Bolling agreed. “It’s country back here. It’s slow. I mean, we love it. We stay back here,” Bolling said. “But at the same time, it’s never going to be the same. There will be a lot of people leave here. I know that. They have nothing to come back to.  But we’ll make it.

455,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/secret-service-personal-cell-phones-oversight/,"Personal cell phone numbers of US Secret Service agents have been provided to oversight bodies looking into the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi would not confirm which oversight entities, but stressed USSS is in full cooperation as multiple inquiries are ongoing. The agency was thrust into the center stage of the House select committee’s investigation into January 6 following former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony in June during a public hearing. Hutchinson claimed then-President Donald Trump attempted to force the Secret Service to take him to the Capitol as Congress worked to certify the 2020 election results. Multiple sources told CNN it is an unusual step to provide personal cell phone numbers of Secret Service agents to investigators. CNN previously reported that the US Secret Service erased text messages from January 5 and 6, 2021. The text messages at issue may have been deleted when the agency conducted a data migration of phones that began January 27, 2021. Multiple oversight bodies, including the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the National Archives and the House January committee, are either investigating or requesting more information about the USSS text messages. It’s not immediately clear whether these personal cell phone numbers from agents are related to those inquiries. CNN recently reported the current USSS director, James Murray, is delaying his retirement, stressing the agency’s commitment to the investigations, such as the January 6 investigation. “I feel strongly about using this time to oversee and ensure our agency’s continued cooperation, responsiveness, and full support with respect to ongoing Congressional and other inquiries,” he said in a message to his workforce.

689,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/how-to-stay-cool-while-sleeping,"Some people run hot all the time, some wake up hot, some find themselves sweaty in the middle of the night and some experience all of the above. It’s not always the greatest feeling, and it can be a sign of something serious, but many times it can be related to hormonal changes, menopause, premenopause or just an overheated environment. Feeling hot can also simply make it harder to sleep, and according to research, the ideal temperature for sleep is actually a chilly 65 degrees Fahrenheit. There’s good news, though! An overheated environment can be fixed with just a few tweaks to your sleeping situation, like cooling bedding and gels or lightweight toppers for when it’s ridiculously hot out. Ahead, we highlight some products that, according to reviewers, make sleeping cool as easy as ever, as well as picks that we’ve personally tried and loved. Best sheets for hot sleepers California Design Den 400-Thread-Count 100% Cotton Sheets Set From $30.38 at Amazon “When shopping for cooling sheets, breathable fabrics made of natural materials do a great job of creating a cooler sleeping environment,” says Liz Boscacci, Casper’s director of product development. “Cotton percale and Tencel are two examples of such materials.” With more than 31,000 reviews, this 100% cotton sheet set is an Amazon favorite. The set comes with a flat sheet, fitted sheet and two pillowcases, and you can take your pick of anything from pastel solids to paisley and polka dots. “I made my bed and being that it was a warm night it provided the opportunity to test them to see if I would feel too warm,” one reviewer writes. “It was a cool comfortable experience and had a perfect sleep in my new sheets!” See more of our cooling sheets picks here. Comfort Spaces Coolmax Cooling Sheets From $20.35 at Amazon “In terms of bedding and fabrics — look for moisture-wicking textiles. These materials are designed to draw water away from the skin, helping your body to regulate its own temperature,” says nurse Angela Ballard. For cooling sheets that aren’t going to set you back too far, look no further than this set. Made of ultra-fine microfiber with moisture-absorbing technology that actually pulls moisture away from the skin, you only need to look at a few reviews to be convinced of their magic. For example: “I live in Arizona, so cool sheets feel like a necessity to me,” one reviewer writes. “I was on the brink of ordering a very expensive set of bamboo sheets from a specialty site when I saw the reviews for this set on Amazon. I’m so happy to report that these sheets are exactly what they purport to be. They are EXTREMELY comfortable and soft. They are also very cool. My husband doesn’t believe in ‘cool’ sheets because he sleeps very hot — he wakes up sweaty more often that not, usually — but he exclaimed last night that these sheets are very cool.” Parachute Linen Sheet Set From $189 at Parachute The winner of the best linen sheets of 2022, this Parachute set is made from 100% European flax in a family-owned factory in Portugal. Light and airy with the ability to get even softer after every wash, the colors couldn’t be dreamier too. “On the summer night we first tested these, the sheets were soft but also firm,” our reviewer wrote. “If this sounds uncomfortable, it was the converse: cool, light and luxurious. Our first mental note was that we felt like we were sleeping on a cloud.” My Sheets Rock The Regulator From $149 at My Sheets Rock “Bamboo rayon has many benefits for hot sleepers, as bamboo fabric wicks moisture, reduces humidity and stretches, all while staying extremely soft,” says Christopher Sun, founder of My Sheets Rock. Made with said bamboo rayon, these are designed to wick away moisture and even minimize smell. We’ve tried them ourselves and love how silky they look too. Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set $319 From $255.20 at Cozy Earth Another bamboo option, these sheets (which Oprah is a fan of), have made several Underscored editors fall head over heels. Made specifically with viscose from bamboo, these sheets are cool to the touch and even moisture-wicking. Luckily, the brand just branched out to supply more colors other than white too, so we’ll definitely be buying another set. Buffy Eucalyptus Sheet Set $149 From $126.65 at Buffy These sheets are made from 100% eucalyptus fiber, giving them a bit of a sheen and a cool-to-the-touch effect that’s simply irresistible for hot sleepers. An Underscored-editor favorite, one staffer who’s a particularly hot sleeper says that since she first tried these sheets three years ago, she hasn’t slept on another set since. Best pillows for hot sleepers Weekender Ventilated Gel Memory Foam Pillow From $34.99 at Amazon Cooling pillows for hot sleepers come in a variety of materials like shredded foam, gels and cotton. Look for one that holds in coolness and wicks away moisture. This well-priced, high-rated foam pillow is infused with a temperature-regulating gel for a cool night’s sleep. “I too had bought every pillow on the market over the years and this one is certainly the most comfortable, most cooling and best support yet,” writes one reviewer. “This is what a pillow should do! Cradle and support your head. My first thought was it wasn’t high enough and wouldn’t feel comfortable. Boy was I wrong. The second my head hit this pillow, I realized what I have been missing all along.” See more of our favorite pillows here. Snuggle-Pedic Original Memory Foam Pillow $54.99 From $44.99 at Amazon The bamboo cover and shredded memory foam make this pillow super breathable, with one happy reviewer writing, “I normally toss and turn all night. I don’t think I’ve moved much since I started using the pillow; it’s absolutely wonderful.” Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow $189 From $139 at Amazon or $199 at Tempur-Pedic From the experts at Tempur-Pedic comes this cooling pillow with gel on both sides to keep you cool all night long. “I’ve purchased close to 20 pillows over the past three years, trying to find one that stays cool while also being comfortable to sleep on. I’ve tried all types (memory foam, feather, real goose down, etc.),” writes one reviewer. “I’ve had this one for three months and have never had a better one. By far the coolest pillow I’ve used, and I don’t think I’ve ever had to flip it over. I’m a back/side sleeper, and the comfort also exceeds nearly every other pillow I’ve purchased. Best sleep I’ve had in years.” Casper Foam Pillow $89 From $66.75 at Casper With cooling foam and a three-layer design meant to make it extra huggable (and who doesn’t want that?), this is one of our favorite pillows to sleep on night after night. You can use the code CNNSLEEP10 for 10% off your entire order. Best blankets for hot sleepers Bearaby Tree Napper From $269 at Bearaby Weighted blankets can be extremely hot under, so when we find one that doesn’t make us sweat, we are elated. Enter: the Bearaby Tree Napper. As one editor observed: “The Tree Napper is especially cooling, as it’s made from moisture-wicking Tencel that uses eucalyptus fiber, a material that’s naturally even cooler than linen, not to mention super soft. In fact, it’s so cool to the touch that sometimes I find myself layering it with another blanket because I’m too chilly — not a sensation I’m used to in July! It’s the ideal summer option for weighted blanket aficionados who appreciate a chunky knit.” See more of our editor-favorite cooling blankets here. Brooklinen Linen Quilt From $279 at Brooklinen If a comforter is always too much for you, look no further than this linen quilt, which thrilled one Underscored editor. As she wrote: “Every night this summer I’ve slept on cooling sheets and a cooling mattress cover and used a cooling pillow. So really the final step in my cool-as-possible sleep setup was a cooling quilt, and this one I can say is just magic. Apart from being impossibly light and easy to bundle yourself in during even the muggiest of nights, it looks fantastic against any sheet color I’ve paired it with. I love the diamond stitching and can even see using it year-round under my heavier comforter.” Tranquility Cool-to-the-Touch Weighted Blanket $78.95 From $60 at Walmart We’ve tried this weighted blanket for several months now and we absolutely adore it. Cool on one side and plush on the other, it’s available in both 15- and 20-pound versions. As one editor wrote: “I made it so the cooler material was against my skin and soundly slept for a solid 10 hours. I never once kicked it off me in the middle of the night.” Bedsure Cooling Blanket From $32.99 at Amazon Looking for a good throw blanket that won’t make you sweat? Check out this one. As one editor wrote: “It’s thin enough that it can roll up really, really small, so it’s great for smaller apartments and storage as well. After hanging out with this blanket on the couch for a few days, I realized that it was a lovely barrier between my hot laptop and my legs, and I never felt the need to kick my legs out from underneath it like I usually have to do with blankets.” Cooling accessories Lasko Portable Electric 42-Inch Oscillating Tower Fan From $74.99 at Amazon With more than 23,000 reviews on Amazon, shoppers love this machine for how quietly it runs and, at the price, just how powerful its cooling powers are. Need more convincing? Just read this review: “One evening I needed a little help with cooling off,” one reviewer writes. “Within five minutes of turning this thing on, it was like an angel had come down from heaven to personally blow cool air on my face. I was genuinely close to tears. If this thing only lasts a month it will have been worth the money.” Need we say more? Honeywell QuietSet 5-Speed Oscillating Tower Fan $49.99 at Target Cooling fans allow a gentle breeze to calm your temp down while you drift to sleep. With more than 500 reviews, this fan is a Target shopper fave, with one writing, “I use it in all the bedrooms and family room, and it seems to circulate the air across most of the room.” Vornado VFan Mini Personal Vintage Air Circulator $39.99 at Amazon Personal fan more your jam? This vintage-looking cutie that reviewers love will sit on your nightstand and keep you cool while you snooze. Best mattresses for hot sleepers Nest Cooling Topper From $219 at Nest Not a mattress itself, but we wanted to start this section with a product that one editor thinks can actually make any mattress a cooling mattress. (Plus, mattresses are expensive, you know?) Made with cool-to-the-touch foam that you sink right into, she says this has “completely changed the way I sleep.” Purple Hybrid Mattress From $1,899 at Purple A unique mix of a gel grid, supportive coils and foam make this one of the coolest mattresses on the market. According to the brand, the pocketed coils allow for greater airflow compared to many other gel and entirely foam beds. “This mattress is fantastic,” writes one reviewer. “It took a couple nights to get used to it, but I sleep more soundly now than I ever did before and much cooler! The grid is what feels so different. It truly is amazing how much spring the mattress has, but when you move it doesn’t affect your partner.” Classic Brands Cool Gel Chill Memory Foam 14-Inch Mattress From $349.99 at Amazon This memory foam mattress is available in three different cooling options — cool gel chill, cool gel cloud and cool gel ice — each with its own benefits so you can really get the mattress of your dreams. “My foam topper I had previous to this mattress always made me too hot,” writes one reviewer. “But this cool gel mattress really does stay cool compared to the foam topper. And it is not too hard. It seems to adjust nicely with my body weight. Glad I bought it.” Leisure Town Cooling Mattress Pad From $49.90 at Amazon With more than 8,500 reviews, this top-rated cotton mattress topper is filled with a down alternative to deliver comfort that reviewers love without heat and sweat. “I had tried several other toppers with the hope that it would provide some cooling relief,” writes one reviewer. “This topper did the trick. Not only did it make my mattress even MORE cozy, it is considerably cooler to sleep on. I would highly recommend this product.”",Napper Chelsea;Angela Ballard;Honeywell Quietset;Liz Boscacci;Rachel Lubitz;Christopher Sun,Walmart,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,2484;TAX_ECON_PRICE,10630;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,1182;TAX_FNCACT_EDITORS,4071;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,7072;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,7777;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,8487;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,8796;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,10540;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,9668;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,10124;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,10207;NATURAL_DISASTER_CHILL,11400;NATURAL_DISASTER_CHILL,11537;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,11569;TAX_FNCACT_STAFFER,4573;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATOR,3523;TAX_DISEASE_MENOPAUSE,293;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,901;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,3588;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,4530;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,4727;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,4838;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,6853;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPERS,10410;TAX_FNCACT_FOUNDER,3721;WB_137_WATER,1951;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPER,4604;TAX_WORLDFISH_SLEEPER,6442;TAX_WORLDBIRDS_GOOSE,6258;WB_135_TRANSPORT,8908;WB_1174_WAREHOUSING_AND_STORAGE,8908;WB_793_TRANSPORT_AND_LOGISTICS_SERVICES,8908;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,341;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,564;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1138;AFFECT,5465;GENERAL_HEALTH,2035;MEDICAL,2035;TAX_FNCACT_NURSE,2035;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,12153;TAX_DISEASE_BODY_WEIGHT,11892;",Arizona;California;Leisure Town;Portugal,2764
269,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/tech/pelosi-taiwan-flight-tracker/,"US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s flight to Taiwan, which bolstered American support for the island nation but angered China, was the single most heavily tracked flight in the history of the online flight tracking site Flightradar24. The website, which uses a network of receivers to track planes’ location and speed, said Wednesday that more than 708,000 people across the globe were tracking the flight when it landed in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei. And more than 2.9 million people tracked at least a portion of the flight amid uncertainty about whether Pelosi would follow through on her pledge to visit the island nation, whose independence is not recognized by China. Though the stop in Taiwan was not part of Pelosi’s offical schedule for her tour of Asia, a Taiwanese and US official confirmed to CNN on Monday that she would be making the stop off. The decision came amid warnings from Biden administration officials, who raised concerns about how China would respond. Pelosi, whose visit to Taiwan was the first of its kind in 25 years, said she intended the trip to make it “unequivocally clear” that the United States would “not abandon” the democratically governed island. She was greeted by Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, in a televised meeting. She thanked Pelosi for visiting and praised her commitment to democracy and bestowed on her Taiwan’s highest civilian honor. Beijing warned that Pelosi’s trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations” and responded with a series of military exercises that began on Tuesday. Pelosi traveled from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, to Taipei aboard a Boeing C-40C jet (a military version of the Boeing 737 jetliner) operated by the US Air Force, according to the flight tracker. The flight flew under the call sign “SPAR19.” Flightradar24, which started as a passion project by two aviation enthusiasts, said in a blog post that traffic on its website became so intense that it nearly brought down the tracker, and it was forced to limit access to the site for non-subscribers by implementing a waiting room feature. “An unprecedented, sustained interest in this particular flight led to extremely heavy load on Flightradar24 infrastructure. Our teams immediately began efforts to maintain the stability of our services. Unfortunately, due to the volume of users, it was necessary to deploy our waiting room functionality, which meters access to Flightradar24 for non-subscribers.” Shortly after Pelosi’s flight landed, the company was able to restore normal access for all users.

201,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/kentucky-flooding-race-deconstructed-newsletter-reaj/,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. Catastrophic floodwaters in Kentucky have killed more than three dozen people. Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Tuesday that the water “swept some people miles away from where they were” and that “it’ll take weeks to account for everybody.” Climate change has supercharged extreme weather events, including the deadly flooding that struck Kentucky, Missouri and Arizona last week. Yet the flooding throws a light on a wider truth: Low-income communities and communities of color bear the brunt of the climate crisis. Deke Arndt, the chief of climate science and services at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, recently underscored the uneven impact of climate change. “Lots of images of people getting rescued from high water this week. I worked with emergency (management) for 10 years, and here’s the truth: they never pull folks from their homes in affluent neighborhoods. Once you see it, you won’t unsee it,” Arndt tweeted last Thursday. “In the context of our changing climate, Big Weather, but especially flash floods, aggressively targets the vulnerable and underinformed,” he added.  Sixteen of the deaths in Kentucky occurred in Knott County, according to the governor’s office on Monday. Seven people were killed in Breathitt County, two in Clay County, two in Letcher County and three in Perry County. These five counties are among the poorest counties in the US, per data from the 2020 US Census. “The reality is that when creeks get up and out of their banks, they almost always find the folks who are already living closer to the margins, whether these are people in manufactured housing or mobile homes or people in homes that are well within the floodplain,” Arndt told CNN. “We saw it in eastern Kentucky last week. We saw it in my home region of western North Carolina last summer.” It’s an unrelenting theme, experts say: Flash floods, in particular, punch hard on already vulnerable communities. To help protect against climate-related hazards, we must think about disaster mitigation not as a short-term goal – but rather as a long-term one. Growth pushes vulnerable groups to the margins There are a few reasons why the climate crisis afflicts some communities more than others, said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy and the author of the 2021 book “Disasterology: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the Climate Crisis.” For one, over the course of many decades, low-income communities and communities of color have been built in locations that are more physically vulnerable to extreme weather events. “As a city expands, certain groups are usually pushed into marshlands or bayous or other high-risk areas,” Montano told CNN. Infrastructure also plays a role. Low-income communities tend to receive far less investment in their infrastructure, which in turn becomes more vulnerable. “So, when there is a rainstorm or another hazard happens, the infrastructure isn’t able to withstand those impacts like the more up-to-date infrastructure in a wealthier community can,” Montano continued.  Other social vulnerability issues matter, too. Wealthier people have the money to construct their homes using higher-standard building materials and building codes. Further, wealthier people have more money to spend on mitigating hazards. “Think of the infamous example of celebrities in California hiring private firefighters,” Montano said. “They’re better able to protect themselves when these hazards happen.” Njoki Mwarumba, an assistant professor of emergency management and disaster preparedness at the University of Nebraska Omaha, echoed some of Montano’s sentiments. “One thing that’s consistently misunderstood and that doesn’t receive the attention it needs is the fact that people don’t wake up and decide to be vulnerable,” Mwarumba told CNN. “Often, when we try to address people in their communities from a point of vulnerability, we miss the systems that made that vulnerability.” Miseducation, historical trauma in Native American and Black American communities, marginalization and disinvestment: Many variables compound to create vulnerability. What ought to happen next? Mwarumba explained that we should direct more of our attention – our knowledge, our data – toward addressing some of these root causes of unsafe conditions. “This is important, because during recovery, you want to think about not only the immediate response but also long-term mitigation,” she said. In the aftermath of a disaster, people frequently say that they want to go back to “normal.” That impulse is understandable, but people shouldn’t strive to return to normal, because normal was the problem in the first place. “You want to rethink your building needs,” Mwarumba said. “Because if you’re trying to quickly get back to normal, what that means is that you’re predisposing yourself to another event. And that event is actually going to be compounded, because you’re going to be dealing with the effects of the event you’re currently going through.” In other words, disasters are very comprehensive, as CNN’s Rachel Ramirez recently stressed, and it’s vital to consider what recovery and preparedness mean beyond just the present moment. Montano pointed out the significance of full, vigorous media coverage. “These disasters aren’t one-off events. The problems we see in Kentucky are going to look remarkably similar to the problems we see in Arizona, Missouri and anywhere else affected by a disaster,” she said. “This is important for the public to understand, because when you see problems come up again and again, that means these are systemic problems.” Sustaining media coverage matters, too. “The reporting on Kentucky is going to drop off in a few days, but in some ways, that’s when the disaster is really just beginning,” Montano said. The recovery from the flooding is going to be long and difficult. It’s crucial that media outlets continue to cover what’s happening and hold governments accountable. Indeed, what governments choose to do, or refuse to do, after a disaster matters greatly, and can have tremendous consequences for the people at the center of an extreme weather event. “We often frame climate change as a science issue or a technology issue or an energy issue or a politics issue,” Arndt said, “but it’s ultimately an anthropological issue.” Put a little bit more bluntly: Which lives do we value? And which do we put in harm’s way?",Njoki Mwarumba;Deke Arndt;Rachel Ramirez;Samantha Montano;Andy Beshear,University Of Nebraska Omaha;Massachusetts Maritime Academy;National Centers For Environmental Information;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOODS,1199;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLASH_FLOODS,2081;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,2456;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,3852;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,441;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,2790;NATURAL_DISASTER_EXTREME_WEATHER,6478;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,441;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,2790;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,6478;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,441;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2790;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,6478;MARITIME_INCIDENT,2516;MARITIME,2516;WB_1773_CLIMATE_CHANGE_IMPACTS,850;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,401;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,661;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,717;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,843;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1157;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2375;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2613;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,6510;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4348;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4365;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,2537;KILL,211;KILL,1403;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,211;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,1403;WB_571_CLIMATE_SCIENCE,725;TRANSPARENCY,6296;TAX_DISEASE_TRAUMA,4329;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4329;TAX_ETHNICITY_NATIVE_AMERICAN,4348;ETH_INDIGINOUS,4348;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,1199;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,2081;WB_699_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT,3910;WB_820_DISASTER_RISK_MANAGEMENT,3910;WB_1705_DISASTER_PREPAREDNESS,3910;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,3910;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,480;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,552;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODING,6169;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,480;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,552;CRISISLEX_C06_WATER_SANITATION,6169;AFFECT,894;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODWATER,3362;NATURAL_DISASTER_HIGH_WATER,910;EDUCATION,2466;EDUCATION,3862;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2466;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,3862;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_MASSACHUSETTS,2507;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,5592;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,5966;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,6224;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,5592;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,5966;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,6224;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5592;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,5966;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,6224;LEADER,1364;TAX_FNCACT_GOVERNOR,1364;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,408;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,850;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,6517;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,408;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,850;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,6517;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,408;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,850;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,6517;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODWATERS,187;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,187;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,706;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_BEAR,636;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3928;WB_137_WATER,293;WB_137_WATER,910;SCIENCE,725;SCIENCE,6530;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,3437;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,4243;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,4294;WB_1160_SHOCKS_AND_VULNERABILITY,4461;WB_695_POVERTY,3437;WB_695_POVERTY,4243;WB_695_POVERTY,4294;WB_695_POVERTY,4461;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6588;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,779;WB_756_VULNERABLE_GROUPS,2318;WB_421_SOCIAL_INCLUSION,2318;WB_134_SOCIAL_DEVELOPMENT,2318;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,4356;",Letcher County;Breathitt County;North Carolina;Knott County;Arizona;Nebraska;Washington;Clay County;Perry County;Kentucky;Missouri;California;American,1321
161,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/brittney-griner-trial,"American women’s basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time Thursday in a case that has raised concerns she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Judge Anna Sotnikova of the Khimki city court delivered the sentence and fined Griner 1 million rubles, or about $16,400. She said the court took into account Griner’s partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail. Prior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech. “I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” Griner said. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom. “I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,” she added. After the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, “I love my family.” The verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry. Griner’s lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal. “We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in the statement. “This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.” Speaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole. Griner “is not doing fine today,” said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held. Sentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations The harsh sentence comes amid the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s saber-rattling with the US and Europe. The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely. Charge d’Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a “miscarriage of justice,” and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was “unacceptable.” “Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement. Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence “puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.” He said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. “This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department’s,” Blinken said. It’s now “up to the Russian side” on whether Griner’s conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.  “We’re still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they’re more empowered to do that, then so be it,” Kirby told reporters in Thursday’s White House briefing. Kirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul and Brittney home.” CNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia’s court proceedings are not legitimate. “This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,” he said. “What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.” Last week, CNN reported that the Biden administration proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, but US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer. The Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.” Griner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.  The Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a “We Are BG” T-shirt,  said after the game the verdict was devastating. “Nobody wanted to even play today,” she told reporters. “How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.” Earlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict “a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare” of her detention. “We are inspired every day by BG’s strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,” the statement reads. Head coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner’s sentence is “unacceptable.” “It’s just heartbreaking,” the coach said. “To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.” In a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.” “The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,” they said. Defense asked for leniency in closing arguments  The court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant’s cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason. In closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued. Even if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor’s prescription, she added. She couldn’t have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said. Boykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication. Boykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, “Basically, it means that you are guilty.” Throughout the trial, Griner’s attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution’s case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport. Her detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.  After she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.  No lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest. On Tuesday, at the seventh hearing in her case, a defense expert testified that the examination of the substance contained in Griner’s vape cartridges did not comply with Russian law. Blagovolina also told CNN her team’s experts identified “a few defects” in the machines used to measure the substance. At trial, Griner testified she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said. “We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said.

555,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/chips-semiconductor-manufacturing-science-act/,"Congress has passed a bill that will invest more than $200 billion over the next five years to help the US regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing.  With bipartisan support, the CHIPS and Science Act was passed by lawmakers in late July, and President Joe Biden signed the bill into law Tuesday. Once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing, the US has lost ground as other countries like China ramped up production, forcing many American manufacturers to import chips – which are essential to the production of cars, smartphones and medical equipment.  The new funding is intended to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the US and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions. The current global chip shortage has limited production of new vehicles, for example, leaving Americans facing stubbornly high car prices. Chip maker Intel is already expected to reap some of the benefits of the new funding, specifically to help boost its previously announced investment to build a semiconductor plant in Ohio.  “This new law gives people like me a chance and allows us to grow our businesses,” said Joshua Aviv at the bill signing event at the White House on Tuesday. Aviv is the CEO and founder of an electric vehicle charging company called SparkCharge that manufactures its parts at a factory in Buffalo, New York.  “For years, my industry has been at the mercy of the supply chain,” Aviv added. The legislation will spend money on a variety of manufacturing incentives aimed at boosting American chip manufacturing as well as investments in research, development and workforce training.  The spending is not paid for by any offsets and instead will add to the federal deficit.  Here’s what is in the spending package, according to summaries by Democratic leadership.  $52.7 billion for chip manufacturing and research The package will invest $39 billion over five years to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing. It will provide companies incentives to build, expand and modernize US facilities and equipment.  The legislation will also create a new 25% tax credit for companies that invest in semiconductor manufacturing equipment or the construction of manufacturing facilities. Private companies that receive financial assistance will be restricted from expanding certain chip manufacturing in China for 10 years.  The law will provide $11 billion over five years to the Department of Commerce to help spur research and development in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, to invest in new technologies and expand workforce training opportunities.  Another $1.5 billion will fund the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund to help telecommunications companies compete with Chinese telecom giant Huawei and limit the scope of other telecommunications companies with close ties to China. Millions of dollars will target workforce development to make sure workers are available to support more manufacturing. $170 billion for scientific research, innovation and space exploration The legislation calls for a historic investment in scientific research and development that amounts to nearly $170 billion over five years, an $82.5 billion increase in the federal government’s baseline authorization.  The majority of that funding will funnel through two government agencies: the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. The investments will help create a National Science Foundation Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships to accelerate American development in technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced manufacturing, 6G communications, energy and materials science.  The federal funding will also fund the creation of new regional technology hubs across the country, strengthen small manufacturers as well as reduce long-term supply chain vulnerabilities in areas such as advanced manufacturing, next-generation communications, computer hardware and pharmaceuticals. About $13 billion will go to education in the science, technology, engineering and math fields – known as STEM – including scholarships and fellowships, with a focus of increasing access to education in these fields in rural areas.  Universities, community colleges and high schools may be eligible for the money in an effort to strengthen America’s workforce so that it can support new chip manufacturing. “There is a great deal of money focused on providing the needed talent,” said Rep.

476,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/media/netflix-wall-street/,"Netflix has had a terrible 2022. In April, it said it lost subscribers for the first time since 2011. Its stock has tumbled more than 60% so far this year. Yet its recent struggles may not be the start of a downward spiral or the beginning of the end for the streaming giant. Rather, it’s a sign that Netflix is becoming a more traditional media company. Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) was originally valued as a Big Tech company, part of the Wall Street acronym, “FAANG,” which stood for Facebook\n            \n                (FB), Apple\n            \n                (AAPL), Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN), Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) and Google\n            \n                (GOOG). Wall Street once valued the company at about $300 billion — a number on par with many Big Tech companies that Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX)’s business model ultimately couldn’t live up to. “I think Netflix was extremely overvalued,” Julia Alexander, director of strategy at Parrot Analytics, told CNN Business. “Unlike those companies that have different tentacles, Netflix does not have a lot of tentacles.”   But Netflix was never really a tech company.  Yes, it relied on subscriber growth like many companies in the tech world, but its subscriber growth was built on having films and TV shows that people wanted to watch and pay for. That’s more a like a studio in Hollywood than a tech company in Silicon Valley. Netflix looked a lot more like a tech company than, say, Disney, Comcast, Paramount or CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. But as those traditional media companies start to look a lot more like Netflix, Netflix in turn is starting to take page out of its rivals’ playbooks: It’s going to start serving ads and it has been releasing some shows over the course of weeks and months rather than all at once. Netflix has said that its cheaper ad tier and clampdown on password sharing may come next year. It’s partnering with Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) for its ad business. “I think in many ways the moves Netflix are making suggest a transition from tech company to media company,” Andrew Hare, a senior vice president of research at Magid, told CNN Business. “With the introduction of ads, crackdown on password sharing, marquee shows like ‘Stranger Things’ experimenting with a staggered release, we are seeing Netflix looking more like a traditional media company every day.” Hare added that Netflix’s former business strategy, which was “once sacrosanct is now being thrown out the window.”  “Netflix once forced Hollywood deeply out of its comfort zone. They brought streaming to the American living room,” he said. “Now it appears some more conventional practices could be what Netflix needs.” At Netflix right now, “a lot of these strategic moves are being made as they mature and move into the next phase as a company,” noted Hare. That includes focusing on cash flow and revenue rather than just growth. “In other words, old school business,” he said. — CNN Business’ Moss Cohen contributed to this report.",Julia Alexander,Warner Bros;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Netflix;Comcast;Disney;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,1001;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1079;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,790;EDUCATION,3052;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3052;TAX_FNCACT_VICE_PRESIDENT,2222;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,355;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1590;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2174;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2462;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,355;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,1590;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2174;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2462;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,355;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1590;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2174;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2462;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,48;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,2305;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2712;ECON_STOCKMARKET,130;MEDIA_SOCIAL,492;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,681;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,842;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1981;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2263;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2522;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3061;MEDIA_MSM,1288;LEADER,2222;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2222;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,2222;TAX_DISEASE_CONVENTIONAL,2773;TAX_FNCACT_SENIOR_VICE_PRESIDENT,2222;WB_290_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_ORGANIZATIONAL_DESIGN,687;WB_288_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_SECTOR_POLICY_AND_REGULATION,687;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,687;",Hollywood;American;New York,653
105,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/health/monkeypox-response-cavalry-sanjay-gupta/,"It’s hard to believe we are face-to-face with a new health crisis, monkeypox, before we are even out of the woods with the previous – but still very much current – crisis, Covid-19. The pandemic, which has held the United States and almost every other country in its grip, should have taught us valuable lessons about how to manage a public health emergency, but it seems we are making some of the same mistakes we made not even three years ago, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus started to spread.  Testing for the monkeypox virus, once very limited, is now more available, but underused. The demand for vaccines is outpacing the supply. There are nearly 2 million courses the highly effective TPOXX antiviral sitting in the Strategic National Stockpile, but many health care providers are still having a hard time getting the medication for their patients. We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, spending more than $4 trillion dollars a year on health care, more per person than anywhere else. With all those resources and technology, it’s not as if the United States is incapable of mounting a significant response to an emerging outbreak. And there is little doubt we will eventually do what should have already been done: declare monkeypox a public health emergency, appoint a national coordinator and mount a more significant response. But why do we wait so long, drag our feet and endure so much suffering in the meantime?   As I have learned over the past few years, there is a significant difference between preparedness and response, even though the two are often conflated. The United States is extraordinarily prepared, ranked No. 1 for pandemic preparedness in the 2021 Global Health Security Index.  Instead, we are leading in a different way. As of today, we have the most confirmed cases of monkeypox on the planet, more than 5,000. That is almost 25% of the global numbers, even though we are just under 5% of the world’s population.   It is now clear: Preparedness alone does not guarantee a rapid response. With Covid-19, and now monkeypox, we were too slow to respond. It was as if we are sitting in a turbo-charged Ferrari, capable of massive acceleration, but instead only idling in the driveway.  Cavalry culture Over the past three years, we have witnessed something counterintuitive. It was predominantly wealthy countries that were hit hardest during the Covid-19 pandemic. They had some of the highest death rates, despite their enormous resources.  While there are many reasons for this, including misinformation, lack of public trust, and the entangling of public health and politics, I think there is something else, as well: We have adopted what I call a “cavalry culture.” We wait for the cavalry to ride in and rescue us, instead of taking smaller preventive steps – such as establishing modern and reliable data systems, mastering our supply chain along the way, and acting early to head off the outbreak in the first place.   If that sounds familiar, it’s because we too often do the same with our personal health matters. According to research published in The Lancet Public Health, nearly half of chronic disease in the United States is mostly preventable, with lifestyle changes. Even knowing that, however, the medical system is set up for the cavalry to come in with expensive medications and high-tech interventions, instead of providing equitable access and incentives for preventative care. There are a couple of important axioms in public health. One is, by the time you think you must act to contain an outbreak, it is already too late. And, if you think you are overreacting, you are probably reacting just the right amount. In the case of Covid, and now monkeypox, we seem to have forgotten those basic public health principles. And, the real question now seems to be: When will the government finally hit the gas pedal on our highly tuned Ferrari? I don’t want to suggest any of this is easy. There are significant issues of uncertainty and unpredictability. Much like a hurricane forming at sea, we often don’t know exactly where or how hard it will hit. We want to be measured, calm in our response and to cause as little disruption as possible. We want to be thoughtful and gather as much information as is available.  And therein lies one of our biggest problems: basic data. I have often wondered, how is it that a numbers-driven, high-tech country like the United States can’t get basic data right?  Data disaster As long as I’ve been reporting on the Covid pandemic, I have always had to offer the caveat that case numbers are probably off, sometimes wildly so. We have probably never had a clear vision on just how widely the virus was spreading at any given time in the United States, and going into the fall 2022, the situation isn’t really any better.  In early July, the Institute for Health Metrics, a research center at the University of Washington, released a model suggesting that actual Covid-19 cases are seven times higher than reported cases. At times, it seems the tech platforms for Snapchat and Twitter offer more data analytics than the patchwork of state and federal systems that underpin the public health of our country.  “First, there’s a lack of data access needed to understand where disease outbreaks are spreading. This is due to data collection limitations that Congress needs to fix,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives and a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  He said there is also a need to update analog systems and connect them to each other – getting them to speak the same language. Right now, it’s the Tower of Babel.  “Second, we lack sufficient numbers and, in some cases, skills of people and systems at the federal, state and local levels that can deliver services and communicate effectively with communities. Finally, we are in perpetual panic and neglect funding cycles,” he said. As a result of all of the things Frieden is describing, our current data collection and reporting system leaves important information fractured into dozens of states and territories, and thousands of county pieces for the CDC to puzzle together. “I have been struck as we at CDC are now conquering another public health challenge – monkeypox – as to how little authority we at CDC have to receive the data,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told the Washington Post.  Walensky is talking about basic data, like where the vaccine has gone, who has been vaccinated, whether the vaccine is working, and even monkeypox case data like who is getting infected, their age and race/ethnicity. Why might this be so?  “States don’t routinely share vaccine doses administered data with the federal government – Covid was really the first time that we were able to successfully put data use agreements in place,” Claire Hannan, the executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, told CNN. Part of the reason is because “states have laws in place to protect identifiable information.” Some information has been getting to the CDC, but it is challenging to get and incomplete. The CDC director told the Washington Post, “We have been speaking to our state and local partners probably at least three times a week, all of them. … That is not how you synthesize data. We need … standardization of those data, and we need to have those data come to us in a standardized fashion so that they can be connected, we can compile them and rapidly report them out. We cannot at CDC collect the data and make informed decisions by calling 64 jurisdictions, and honestly, 3,000 counties.”  The CDC is currently working on agreements that would broaden the agency’s access to states’ data, as they successfully did with Covid. Hannan explained, “The need to quickly get the [monkeypox] vaccine out left no time to get data sharing agreements in place.” But even if those agreements were in place, it still doesn’t mean the states’ ability to actually obtain vaccine doses would be made any easier. That’s because the states wouldn’t be using the same data system for ordering and tracking doses they generally use. Because the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response are in charge of monkeypox vaccine distribution, there would be yet another data system involved.  “They were asking states to request the vaccine using paper forms and email,” said Hannan. “They were asking states to complete forms [with fillable fields] on those who were receiving the vaccine and return these forms to the federal government.”  The problem was there weren’t even the right fields for the specific questions being asked, such as reason for vaccination or type of exposure or risk, Hannan said. It wasn’t that the necessary forms weren’t being filled out, it was that they couldn’t be filled out because of disparate data platforms.  It is a baffling level of bureaucracy in the middle of an unfolding outbreak. Testing, vaccines, therapeutics As things stand now, the issues with data collection, testing, vaccines, treatments and communication are sounding a lot like the ones we experienced with Covid-19.  But, to be clear, monkeypox is not that much like Covid. For now, it seems to spread primarily through sores or lesions during close, personal touch and shared objects like towels and linens, as well as respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact.  The monkeypox outbreak is also different for another fundamental reason. Unlike with Covid, which was caused by a novel virus, the basic tools already exist either for monkeypox or its close relative, smallpox. We didn’t have to build them from scratch. That means we could have had them or put them to better use by now. Take testing. At the start of the outbreak, testing capability was capped at about 6,000 tests per week, which meant that doctors really had to ration them to a narrow group of people – primarily a subset of men who have sex with men. Since then, the CDC has partnered with five labs to scale up our capabilities and we should soon be able to process up to 80,000 tests a week. But the tests are being underutilized, according to CNN reporting. Experts blamed the low uptake on several factors, including a lack of awareness among doctors about the virus and the fear of stigma among patients. So, just as with Covid, the real scope of the monkeypox outbreak is probably underappreciated. Confirmed or probable cases stand around 5,000, according to CDC data, but the number could be several fold higher.  Another tool that could be tremendously helpful is testing of wastewater. As we have seen with Covid, it can better define the scope of the outbreak and where it will emerge next. Two months into the outbreak, we still aren’t doing this widely for monkeypox.    And then there are vaccines. Unlike Covid, where we spent upward of $20 billion to develop, test and distribute vaccines, we already have a vaccine specifically approved for monkeypox. Supplies were limited and the initial US vaccination strategy focused on known monkeypox cases and their immediate contacts. But the outbreak continued to grow, and the strategy had to change. The count of people eligible for the two-dose Jynneos vaccine has now expanded to an estimated 1.5 million.  With that same cavalry culture, we are woefully behind in getting those doses to people who want them. At this time, only 336,710 doses have been shipped to states. Ordering only just began for about 800,000 more doses. This scarcity has created long lines in monkeypox hotspots like New York City, which has the highest number of cases in the country.  It also means that the vaccine, which can be given within 14 days of exposure (but preferably within four) to prevent or reduce the severity of disease, is currently being used more as a treatment – a post-exposure prophylaxis – rather than as a real preventive measure. As National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CNN, that focus will have to shift.  “It’s very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,” Fauci said. “What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure but go well beyond that.” It’s a missed opportunity that won’t be rectified immediately, even with the soon-to-arrive 786,000 doses announced by HHS this week. Needs will still outstrip supply. Finally, there is the issue of treatment. The CDC has made the antiviral smallpox treatment tecovirimat, called TPOXX, available to monkeypox patients who have or are at high risk of severe disease under an “alternate regulatory mechanism.” There are 1.7 million courses of TPOXX stockpiled. But once again, getting the medication to patients who could immediately benefit has proven to be bureaucratically burdensome for both patients and providers. “You’re talking about a five, six-day time lag to get that medication to you at a local doctor’s office, no matter where you are. And the paperwork, and all of the bureaucracy to make that happen is very cumbersome, takes a few hours of your time. And that’s the barrier,” Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the LGBTQ-centered Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, told me recently.  Fortunately, those rules were loosened somewhat last week, allowing patients to get treated more quickly and reducing the amount of documentation needed. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration are working to further streamline the process.  In the meantime, though, patients are suffering. Even though most cases are “mild,” they are still uncomfortable, or downright painful, depending on where sores appear. Plus, there is a risk of long-term complications if the pox lesions develop in areas around the eye or GI tract. All of these gaps have the hardest hit community on edge. “Largely public health officials know how this has spread. They know how to vaccinate people … we know how to treat it, and we know how to prevent it,” says Samuel Garrett-Pate, managing director of external affairs of Equality California, the largest statewide LBGTQ+ civil rights organization. “It unfortunately seems that despite two years of building up our public health infrastructure to prevent what happened with Covid-19 from ever happening again, despite the fact that we are better prepared in terms of already having a vaccine available, the CDC and FDA seem to be caught flat-footed once again. And I think as a result, you’re seeing very real and understandable fear anxiety among the LGBTQ community.” Is it too late? Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current board member of Pfizer, has been pessimistic about the trajectory of monkeypox in the United States. “We’re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that’s persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed and if it hasn’t closed, it’s certainly starting to close,” he said on Face the Nation on July 17.  CDC’s Walensky pushed back on Gottlieb’s assessment calling it “misinformed and off base,” saying that while it’s true there is much work to do, the US has made dramatic progress on priorities like testing, vaccines and education. There has been measurable progress in these areas, no doubt.  But, I do worry that we once again waited too long. We sat idling in our Ferrari, perhaps not wanting to believe that somehow we had suddenly found ourselves in the middle of yet another outbreak. I remember when I first saw a case of monkeypox – it was in 2008, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the handful of countries in Africa where the disease is endemic. To tell you the truth, I never thought I would see it in the United States. After all, it was a virus that hadn’t traveled much since it was first identified in DRC in 1970. My guess was that most of my medical colleagues in the United States would likely only see pictures of the distinctive pox lesions in textbooks.   The world, however, is changing, as we have been reminded of twice in the last few years. There are new pathogens emerging, and existing pathogens are more easily traveling the world. We have learned painful lessons in the last few years, and we are now in the midst of our first significant test since the Covid pandemic began, to see if we do any better this time around.  There is no doubt we are capable, and we are prepared. The question is will we use all those remarkable resources and respond, or we will wait and suffer until the cavalry has to rescue us once again?

389,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/politics/trump-wins-cpac-straw-poll-dallas-texas/,"At the Conservative Political Action Conference Texas on Saturday, former President Donald Trump overwhelmingly won an unofficial straw poll of attendees who were asked who they preferred as the Republican nominee for president in 2024. “He’s more popular than ever,” said Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump who conducted the straw poll. McLaughlin announced the results from the CPAC Texas main stage about two hours before Trump’s scheduled appearance. Among the attendees who voted, 69% said they preferred Trump, with 24% saying they would prefer Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. When asked about who they would prefer if Trump did not run for president, 65% of respondents said they preferred DeSantis, while 8% said they would support Donald Trump Jr. The straw poll is not a scientific survey, with a pool limited to CPAC attendees, and is not representative of the broader GOP electorate. The results are reflective of straw polls at previous CPACs since Trump left office, which showed the former President with a large lead among the conservative activists and DeSantis as the favorite alternative. In February, Trump won a straw poll at CPAC in Orlando, Florida, with 59% of the vote. DeSantis came in second in that poll with 28% of the vote, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came in a distant third with 2% of the vote. In a July 2021 CPAC straw poll, Trump topped the GOP field with support from 70% of conference attendees, compared to 21% who selected DeSantis last year. In an interview with New York Magazine last month, Trump said he was still deciding when – not if – he should announce a 2024 campaign. DeSantis is also widely considered to be a contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.

1,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/media/texas-dpr-lawsuit-uvalde/,"More than a dozen major news organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Texas Department of Public Safety to obtain public records relating to the Robb Elementary School massacre. The coalition includes CNN, the Texas Tribune, and many of the state and the country’s biggest news outlets.  The news organizations have been fighting for weeks to obtain information on behalf of the public amid serial falsehoods and stonewalling from Texas officials in the aftermath of the mass shooting. The lawsuit, filed in state court in Austin, arises under the Texas Public Information Act, which enables news outlets and members of the public to pursue litigation to obtain records. The news outlets cited many previous requests for information and an “ensuing failure to disclose public records concerning this abhorrent tragedy.”  “The Texas Department of Public Safety has offered inconsistent accounts of how law enforcement responded to the Uvalde tragedy, and its lack of transparency has stirred suspicion and frustration in a community that is still struggling with grief and shock,” said Laura Lee Prather, a First Amendment lawyer at Haynes Boone who represents the plaintiffs. “DPS has refused numerous requests by these news organizations even though it’s clear under Texas law that the public is entitled to have access to these important public records. We ask that the court grant our petition so that the people of Texas can understand the truth about what happened.” The suit notes that the public safety department has “selectively disclosed” information, but has dismissed more thorough records requests. Thus the news outlets want the court to order the department “to produce all responsive records.”  The other participating news organizations are ABC, CBS, NBC, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones, The Washington Post, and ProPublica; local TV and media companies Gannett, Graham Media, Scripps and TEGNA Nicole Carroll, the editor in chief of Gannett’s USA Today, said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” last month that the coalition is necessary because “we need to get to the truth.

Here, inside the gang-held territory of Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti’s SWAT team has driven into a gunfight that has already torn up a civilian bus.  “Can you see where it came from?” the SWAT members breathlessly asked each other inside the armored vehicle. It provides only a tiny sliver of a window onto the streets outside, which at one moment appear deserted, the next teeming with civilians trying to flee to safety.  In the past 72 hours, police have killed a leader of the 400 Mawozo gang and rescued six hostages from them, they say. But the gang - one of dozens terrorizing the capital - have not been dislodged from these streets.  “Can you see that red sign ‘SMS’? That’s them,” said a SWAT officer, indicating the gunmen’s position. Like his team, he did not want to be named, citing their safety. He pointed down the road towards a small shack, as dozens of people flooded from a side-alley into the street.  “Get away,” he said to the crowd, over the armored car’s loudspeaker. “You’re too exposed. It’s dangerous.”  The officer ordered the vehicle to move into a new position. “When we get to the spot, open up on anything that moves,” he said. Heavy gunfire between police and gang members followed.    It is a common scene of injury, gunfire and panic in one of the dozens of neighborhoods controlled by gangs as Port-au-Prince appears to descend into a full-blown war between police and increasingly well-equipped and organized criminal groups.  And this is a familiar routine: Police probe into gang areas to show their reach, and gangs respond with intense volleys of bullets.  In the area of Cité Soleil, ten days of violence in July left more than 470 people dead, injured or missing, according to the UN, after the G9 gang tried to expand its reach in the area, taking territory from rival gangs.  Social media video from inside the area shows gangs using a bulldozer covered with steel plates to act as armor demolishing homes, presumably those of rivals. Other houses had been burned, with other video showing dozens of locals fleeing the area on foot at night, during the peak of the fighting.  Civilians who fled Cité Soleil found little respite, with dozens receiving food handouts from the World Food Programme and sheltering in the open air of the Hugo Chavez recreational park.  Flies blanket the rain-sodden concrete floor of the sporting amphitheater stage, where children as young as four months struggle to sleep, exposed to the elements. One has bruises from a fall, another a painful and ugly rash, but they are alive.  Here, Natalie Aristel angrily shows us her new, unpalatable home.   “Here’s where I sleep in a puddle,” she said, pointing at the water. “They burned my house and shot my husband seven times,” she says, referring to gang members.  “I can’t even afford to go see him [in hospital]. In this park, even if they brought some food, there’s never enough for everyone. The kids are dying.”  Others are missing. “I have four kids, but my first is missing and I can’t find him,” another woman said. “We’ve been totally abandoned by the state and have to pay to even use a toilet,” another added.  A young boy added: “My mother and father have died. My aunt saved me. I want to go to school but it was torn down.”  Locals speak of a perfect storm of calamities – and warn the country increasingly feels on the verge of societal collapse.  What remains of the country’s emergency interim government, created last year after the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, is beginning to crumble and steeped in accusations of inactivity. His successor, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, has pledged to combat insecurity and hold new elections, but so far shown little progress toward either goal.  Meanwhile, analysts calculate inflation in the country at 30%. Gas is scarce and the subject of angry queues at stations. The UN has warned gang violence may put the youngest children in areas of active fighting at risk of imminent starvation, as their parents cannot access food or go to work.  One Haitian security forces source speaking to CNN estimated that gangs control or influence three quarters of the city.  Frantz Elbe, Director General of the Haitian National Police, rejects the assertion. “It is not a general problem in the metropolitan area,” he told CNN, declining to give a percentage.  Yet it is indisputable that vital parts of the national infrastructure are now entirely in criminal hands. The city’s vital port – Haiti’s main – is controlled by gangs, who dominate the road outside. So is the main highway to the country’s south, which means the fragile part of the country that was hit by an earthquake last year has been effectively cut off from the capital. Gangs are also expanding their control in the city’s east, where Croix-des-Bouquets lies, and in the north, around Cité Soleil, observers said.  Kidnappings are rampant and indiscriminate – one of few thriving industries in Haiti. Seventeen American and Canadian missionaries were kidnapped last year after visiting an orphanage in Croix-des-Bouquets, and only released after a ransom was paid to the 400 Mawozo gang.  Police, often outgunned, are doing what they can, Elbe tells CNN.  “The gangs are changing the way they fight. It used to be with knives, and now it is with big weapons. The police need to be well-equipped. With the little we have, we will do what we can to fight the gang members,” he said.  The challenge they face is exposed by a brief checkpoint set up in Croix-des-Bouquets, where a truck has been dragged across a main road by the gangs, and torched.  Police bring in an armored military bulldozer to push the wreckage to the roadside, which is already littered with other truck carcasses. The bulldozer operator, asked if he works under fire, replies: “Often.”   SWAT police set up a perimeter, scanning nearby rooftops. Locals and the vehicles they travel in are stopped and checked. One man says the situation is “bad, very bad,” before another gives him a stern glance.  He suddenly changes tone: “We know nothing.”  Fear is the currency of this war, though it is unclear if he fears speaking to the press, or the police, or what the gang may learn he said later.  To flee this fear, however, requires enduring more. A short boat journey from the mainland is the island of La Gonave, a hub for human traffickers.    The lackadaisical tempo and blue water of one tiny inlet on La Gonave belies its poverty. Heat, trash, hunger and the business of leaving dominate this world.  One, a smuggler who introduced himself as Johnny, calmly explained how his business works.  The journey is often one-way for the boat, so each endeavor requires the boat to be bought outright, at a cost of about US $10,000, he says. To cover that cost, Johnny needs at least two hundred customers, who will huddle in its disheveled hull.  Shreds of netting appear to plug any gaps between in the hull, and loose wooden planks will make up the boat’s interior. Johnny shows where the pump and motors will eventually go.  “If we die, we die. If we make it, we make it,” he said.  He added he hoped to pack his boat with 250 passengers, as he considered it in “good” condition.  The ultimate destination is the United States, with Cuba and the Turks and Caicos islands sometimes accidental stops along the way.  And it is from these three places that the International Organization for Migration has reported surging numbers of forced repatriations of Haitians in the first seven months of this year, with 20,016 so far, compared to 19,629 for all of 2021.  Some Haitians appear to be getting closer to the journey’s end, with the US Coast Guard interdicting 6,114 Haitians between October and late June – four times as many as between October 2020 and October 2021. In the past weekend alone, more than 330 migrants from Haiti were rescued by the US Coast Guard near the Florida Keys.   The numbers are as staggering as the risks. Previous journeys from this inlet have ended in tragedy. Johnny is unclear on the timing of the last boat, but precise about the potential losses: One recent trip he organized led to the deaths of 29 people.  “The boat had an engine problem,” he said. “Water got inside the boat. We called for help, but they took too long. The boat was sinking while I was trying to save people. When help came, it was too late.”  While CNN cannot independently confirm Johnny’s account of the system, two other locals who said they were involved in trafficking described similar details independently. Authorities in the neighboring Caribbean nations the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos have repeatedly reported finding the remains of would-be migrants after boats capsized in their waters.  Despite the risks, many Haitians are still desperate for a way out. Locals on La Gonave told CNN that at least 40 people who aimed to attempt the boat trip were already on the island and the rest would follow from the mainland once Johnny said the boat was ready.  One potential passenger, a university graduate who was once a teacher, described why he would risk all to take the voyage.  “I worked as a teacher, but it did not work out. Now, I am driving a motorcycle every day in the sun and the dust. How will I be able to take care of my family when I have one?”  He said he saved a year’s money to make the journey, and did not fear the rickety conditions of the boat. “I can be eaten by a shark or make it to America.”",Ariel Henry;Hugo Chavez;Jovenel Mo;Natalie Aristel;Frantz Elbe;Frantz Elbe,International Organization For Migration;Haitian National Police;World Food

561,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/wisconsin-senate-race/,"Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes are political opposites. But as the two prepare for what could become one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2022 cycle, they are leveling similar attacks to define each other: Casting their opponent as too extreme and out of touch with Wisconsin voters, while arguing the other is not a true representative of the state’s working class. “The problem is Ron Johnson has turned his back on working people and I’ve fought for working people my entire career, even before I was an office,” Barnes said when asked for the single biggest difference between himself and Johnson, who made millions running a plastics manufacturer before he entered public office. “His wealth isn’t the problem – it’s the fact that he is ultra-wealthy and out of touch.” Johnson’s campaign declined to make him available to CNN, but a Johnson campaign adviser previewed a notably similar message.  “(Barnes) is out of touch with where the majority of the state is,” said adviser Ben Voelkel, citing some of the more liberal positions Barnes has backed throughout his career. “Mandela Barnes talks a lot about his dad working the third shift work. … Mandela Barnes hasn’t done any of that. He has been a career political activist.” Johnson has already described Barnes as Democrats’ “most radical left candidate,” adding that “a radical left Senator from Wisconsin is not the solution.” Johnson recently called him “a progressive puppet out to fundamentally change America.” The attacks – delivered ahead of Tuesday’s Wisconsin Senate primaries, which appear to be already decided – are previews of what will likely become an acrimonious race, one that experts expect will see tens of millions spent on negative advertising as each side attempts to solidify their base voters in November. Johnson, the incumbent, faces no primary challenge after he opted to run for a third term. The senator, who promised to only serve another full term when he ran for reelection in 2016, waffled on the third term for months, but eventually decided to get into the race because “America is in peril” and he wants to end Democratic control of Washington. Barnes initially had significant primary challengers, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who spent more than $11 million of his own money airing ads throughout the state. But over the span of a week last month, Barnes’ three top primary opponents – Lasry, Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson – all dropped out of the race and endorsed the lieutenant governor, effectively ending the primary. “I could not have imagined it ending up this way,” Barnes told CNN. “To me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the democratic majority is.” As the two candidates turn their focus on each other, Wisconsin represents yet another example of a high stakes Senate race where the contrast between candidates is significant, including Republican Herschel Walker vs. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Republican Mehmet Oz against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Republican Blake Masters vs. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona.  ‘The most vulnerable Republican incumbent’  The Barnes strategy is to define Johnson as a changed man, someone who went to Washington as an insurgent candidate but then enmeshed himself into the Republican Party led by former President Donald Trump. The attacks will include Johnson’s own admission that the 2017 tax bill passed by Republicans in Washington benefited his own company; his reported role in attempting to push a slate of fake electors after the 2020 election; and his more recent suggestion that Social Security and Medicare, two popular social spending programs, be changed from mandatory to discretionary spending, something experts argue could effectively end the programs. “What we ought to be doing is we ought to turn everything into discretionary spending so that it’s all evaluated so that we can fix problems or fix programs that are broken that are going to be going bankrupt,” Johnson said earlier this month. Barnes wasted no time jumping on the comment, using it to argue that Johnson’s personal wealth makes it impossible for him to understand what these programs mean to working class people. “If he wants be anti-Social Security, that’s on him,” Barnes told CNN, using the Johnson comment to inoculate himself from Republican charges of being too extreme. “That’s much more extreme than wanting working families and people all across Wisconsin have a fair shot.” With the primary all but decided, Barnes put out an attack ad earlier this month that hit Johnson on outsourcing jobs, using the senator’s defense of a company that took jobs out of Wisconsin. “Ron Johnson couldn’t be more out of touch with Wisconsin,” the ad says. Democrats are also preparing to paint Johnson as a candidate who has become a conspiracy theory promoter, including questioning the push to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, calling climate change “bullsh*t,” and suggesting – without any evidence – that the FBI had more inside knowledge than it let on about the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. Republican operatives working on Senate campaigns acknowledged the impact some of Johnson’s comments have had on his image. A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 46% of Wisconsin voters viewed him unfavorably, compared to 37% who had a favorable view. But one operative argued that some positive Johnson messaging over the summer, including significant spending by an outside group focused on inflation and a Johnson campaign ad focus on legislation that allowed for more experimental drug treatments, have done some rehabilitation. “His numbers are moving in the right direction,” the operative said, adding that, no matter what, “it is going to be a close race.” Democrats see negative views of Johnson as central to their plan of turning the general election into a referendum of the senator. “Ron Johnson is, without a doubt, the most vulnerable Republican incumbent on the map,” said Amanda Sherman Baity, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ‘Defined by all these left-wing positions’ The attacks on Barnes center on accusations that he is too extreme for the state, using his time as a community organizer, a state assemblyman from a solidly Democratic district and a “longtime leader” in the Working Families Party against him as he runs for Senate. The hits include his ties to members of the “Squad,” a group of liberal lawmakers in Congress who are often attacked by Republicans; a photo taken of him holding up an “Abolish ICE” T-shirt; and positions like ending cash bail, supporting the Green New Deal and a host of other views the Johnson campaign believes are too “extreme” for Wisconsin voters. Barnes has said he does not support abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but supports “addressing the concerns and issues and challenges that people have so that we can have a fair, comprehensive immigration reform system.” “All of these things are positions that might get you applause at a Working Families Party rally or get you the endorsement of AOC or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but when you look across the state, that is not where 50+1 of the state sits,” Voelkel said. One issue that Barnes’ campaign must confront is the fact that polls show that many Wisconsin voters don’t know enough about him to have an opinion – something that can be both helpful and hurtful. “Barnes is not nearly as known in the state as Johnson,” said Charles Franklin, pollster for the Marquette Law School poll, citing a recent poll that found over 50% of Democratic primary voters didn’t know enough about the lieutenant governor to form an opinion. “That is an opportunity for the Johnson side … to really try to step in and define Barnes.” And they plan to do just that, with the Johnson campaign and outside groups already gearing up to cast Barnes as out of step with most Wisconsin voters. “He is going to be defined by all these left-wing positions that he took in the past,” said Jack Pandol, spokesman for Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC focused on Senate races. “There is a lot that voters are going to be made aware of in the coming months and that will be the first information that some voters are getting about Barnes.” Barnes responded to these attacks by saying Republicans “tried to say the same thing about Tammy Baldwin,” and she went on to win the state’s other Senate seat in 2012 and reelection in 2018. “People like Ron Johnson are going to lie about whatever, anything he can think of, to take the heat off his own bad behavior,” he said. ‘We were polarized before it was cool’ The question among experts in Wisconsin is whether, after years of polarization and remarkably tight elections, there are even enough persuadable voters in the state to make the general election anything more than a base-focused race. Wisconsin has been a swing state for years. When Trump won it in 2016, he was the first Republican to win it since 1984. While Biden won the state back in 2020, the state has long had years of Republican governors, including Scott Walker from 2011 to 2019, and Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. “We were polarized before it was cool,” said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic operative in Wisconsin, arguing that the fights around union rights in 2011 and 2012 led to the state being deeply polarized long before the arrival of Donald Trump. “So that shrinking segment of swing voters is kind of the ball game. Yes, the political environment may be bad, but Republicans’ brand is rotten with those voters.” This is why political watchers like Franklin and others expect a deluge of negative ads in the contest, with both sides running campaigns that “reflect that polarization that we have had for a good 12 years.” Democrats are confident that if they can turn the race into a referendum on Johnson, there are enough votes who have backed him in the past who are ready for an alternative. “There is absolutely a world of ticket splitters, a world of persuadable voters and a world of people who might or might turn out,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.  Democrats do, however, face a difficult national environment, with President Joe Biden’s poll numbers slumping and voters across the country skeptical of Democratic leadership in Washington. With this in mind, Barnes argued it would be Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers – not the president – who would have the most direct impact on the contest. Evers himself is up for reelection. While he did not have a primary challenge, he will likely face a tough race against whoever emerges from what has been a tight Republican primary race on Tuesday. “This is a very Wisconsin focused race,” he said, citing a recent poll that found 48% of Wisconsin voters approved of Evers. “I would say that people know the work that we’ve been doing here in state and this race isn’t going to be determined about what people think about national politics.”",John Fetterman;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Mehmet Oz;Tom Nelson;Ben Voelkel;Scott Walker;Elizabeth Warren;Alex Lasry;Joe Biden;Charles Franklin;Ben Wikler;Raphael Warnock;Tammy Baldwin;Herschel Walker;Joe Zepecki;Jack Pandol;Tony Evers;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Amanda Sherman Baity;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Sarah Godlewski;Mark Kelly,Senate Leadership Fund;Republican Party;Democratic Party Of Wisconsin;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Marquette Law School;Marquette Law School;Families Party;Families Party;Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee;Wisconsin Senate,"TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,904;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,1021;EDUCATION,5414;EDUCATION,7699;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,93;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1263;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9651;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9747;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,394;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,25;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3032;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3108;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3179;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3269;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3457;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4516;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5273;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6127;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,8239;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9119;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9220;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9689;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,10821;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,25;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3032;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3108;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3179;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3269;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3457;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4516;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5273;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6127;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,8239;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9119;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9220;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9689;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,10821;LEADER,2611;LEADER,7820;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,1335;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,704;ELECTION,339;ELECTION,1808;ELECTION,5453;ELECTION,6898;ELECTION,7492;ELECTION,7772;ELECTION,8080;ELECTION,8301;ELECTION,8406;ELECTION,8947;ELECTION,9605;ELECTION,9723;ELECTION,10182;ELECTION,10416;ELECTION,10953;",Pennsylvania;Outagamie County;Wisconsin;Arizona;America;Georgia;Washington;Milwaukee,2247
80,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/perspectives/cryptocurrency-government-regulation/,"Editor’s Note: Emily Parker is executive director of global content at CoinDesk and a former policy advisor at the US State Department and writer/editor at The Wall Street Journal. She is the author of “Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From the Internet Underground.” The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.  Cryptocurrency is having an existential crisis. Last month, crypto lender Celsius filed for bankruptcy protection. It has frozen withdrawals since June 12, and it’s unclear if or when customers will get their money back. But Celsius is just one domino to fall. Crypto lender Voyager Digital also recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Ordinary investors who deposited their money into Voyager likely don’t know if or when they will see their funds again. Bitcoin, meanwhile, recently fell more than 70% off its all-time high from last year. And back in May, TerraUSD (UST), a so-called stablecoin that was supposed to trade at $1, saw its price fall well below that, causing steep losses for those who held it or its sister coin Luna (Luna’s value was linked to UST). The underlying problem is a combination of risky lending, poor risk management and opaque finances. So when crypto prices crashed, likely as a result of fears of rising inflation and the possibility of a recession, some crypto companies didn’t have the capital to cushion the blow. The result has been the disappearance of billions of dollars in value, often with ordinary investors paying the price.  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are supposed to be independent of any government. But we have now reached the point where stronger government regulation of the crypto industry is both necessary and inevitable. At the same time, the industry can’t just wait for the government to act. Crypto companies must also try to better police themselves.  That starts with providing more transparency. While transparency is one of the core ideals of blockchain technology — all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are viewable for the world to see, for example — some crypto companies are strikingly opaque. In the case of Celsius, Vermont’s Department of Financial Regulation has said that “customers did not receive critical disclosures about its financial condition, investing activities, risk factors, and ability to repay its obligations to depositors and other creditors.” At the very least, companies need to put much clearer warning labels on their products outlining the risks of depositing or investing with them, as well as more information about how customers’ deposits are being used. With stronger regulation, the Celsius situation might have played out differently. Its model was essentially to take user deposits and use them for risky and illiquid investments, and users enjoyed high interest rates in return. Celsius was essentially acting as a bank, without the regulatory protections or FDIC insurance. “Prudential regulation, such as those applying to banks, would almost certainly have prevented many of the problems in our sector,” Caitlin Long, CEO of depository institution Custodia Bank, said in an interview. “Prudential capital requirements, investment restrictions, background checks on all executives, annual supervisory exams — all those things don’t apply to the crypto industry. They do apply to banks though.” This kind of regulatory overhaul isn’t likely to come anytime soon, however. That’s why venture capitalists and ordinary investors alike should push companies for greater transparency and accountability, demanding audits and disclosures about lending practices and capital reserves. When crypto prices were sky-high, few took a hard look at these companies’ business practices.  The same was true with the stablecoin UST. When the market was strong, few publicly pointed out what are now obvious red flags, and those who did risked being shouted down by crypto enthusiasts on social media. Now, UST’s dramatic collapse may well hasten stablecoin regulation in the United States.  There are widespread concerns that some of the leading stablecoins are not nearly as stable as they claim to be. The fear is that if investors decided en masse to redeem their coins for the US dollars that supposedly back them, the stablecoin issuer would not have enough cash on hand to fulfill these orders. US lawmakers were reportedly closing in on a bipartisan deal to regulate stablecoins, but consideration for the bill has been delayed until after August. The bill, which is not yet public, would treat stablecoin issuers more like banks and subject them to federal supervision. It would also include strict requirements for the assets that back a stablecoin.  Another bill by Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand aims to bring more regulatory clarity overall by creating a standard for deciding which digital assets are commodities and which are securities. That would help clarify which assets are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission vs. the Securities and Exchange Commission. A clearer and more consistent regulatory framework around what companies can and can’t do, as well as which federal agency regulates which digital assets, could bring greater protections for ordinary investors. Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the SEC, has long argued for more regulatory clarity. “If we decided that crypto lending is an area that we can implicate the securities laws, we could have sat down a long time ago and hammered out some rules around that that made sense,” she said in an interview, speaking in her personal capacity.  Instead, what you often get is regulation by enforcement, where companies are punished after the fact. One of the problems with these one-off enforcement actions is that they don’t necessarily cover the whole crypto landscape. “Not only is that not particularly fair, because sometimes enforcement actions come late, and sometimes it’s a question of ‘why did you go after this project instead of this project,’ but also because it allows people who are really doing bad things to get lost in the shuffle,” Peirce said. These proposals are all steps in the right direction for starting a serious conversation about crypto regulation. But given other priorities in Washington, it’s unclear when new regulations would take effect or what they will look like in their final form.  Smart regulation is necessary, but it won’t be enough. Crypto innovation moves faster than any government’s attempt to rein it in. Political negotiations can also delay the passage of bills. Furthermore, with every new crisis, cryptocurrency loses more credibility. This could lead regulators to crack down harder than they would have otherwise, stifling innovation in a still-evolving field. An industry that prides itself on decentralization shouldn’t rely on the government to save it from itself.",Emily Parker;Hester Peirce;Luna Luna;Cynthia Lummis;Kirsten Gillibrand,Exchange Commission;Commodity Futures Trading Commission;Vermont Department Of Financial Regulation;Us State Department;Prudential;Prudential;Custodia Bank;United States;United States,"UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2175;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1624;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1688;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3265;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,6707;ECON_INFLATION,1247;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,1247;WB_442_INFLATION,1247;TAX_ECON_PRICE,946;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1449;EPU_CATS_FINANCIAL_REGULATION,2854;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_DOLLARS,4164;TAX_FNCACT_COMMISSIONER,5214;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,2835;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,3322;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,4721;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,5012;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,5263;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,193;DELAY,4407;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,4407;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,4407;ECON_BUDGET_DEFICIT,2708;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,370;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,6527;TRANSPARENCY,1837;TRANSPARENCY,1857;TRANSPARENCY,3478;SECURITY_SERVICES,1778;TAX_FNCACT_POLICE,1778;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1778;SCIENCE,6375;SCIENCE,6669;SOC_INNOVATION,6375;SOC_INNOVATION,6669;MEDIA_SOCIAL,3877;WB_652_ICT_APPLICATIONS,3877;WB_662_SOCIAL_MEDIA,3877;WB_658_ENTERPRISE_APPLICATIONS,3877;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR,48;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1531;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1590;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,1722;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6408;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,6778;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1531;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1590;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,1722;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6408;EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,6778;WB_845_LEGAL_AND_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK,5359;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,5359;WB_969_CAPITAL_MARKETS_LAW_AND_REGULATION,5359;WB_853_FINANCIAL_LAWS_AND_REGULATIONS,5359;TAX_FNCACT_DIRECTOR,48;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,6441;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,4085;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVE,39;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,3877;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,3877;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,3877;LEADER,4287;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,4287;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4287;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,4287;WB_1973_FINANCIAL_RISK_REDUCTION,2864;WB_435_AGRICULTURE_AND_FOOD_SECURITY,2864;WB_337_INSURANCE,2864;WB_1967_AGRICULTURAL_RISK_AND_SECURITY,2864;ECON_WORLDCURRENCIES_US_DOLLARS,4164;NEGOTIATIONS,6454;WB_840_JUSTICE,6454;WB_2473_DIPLOMACY_AND_NEGOTIATIONS,6454;WB_939_NEGOTIATION,6454;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,6454;WB_936_ALTERNATIVE_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,6454;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,6454;WB_843_DISPUTE_RESOLUTION,6454;WB_2471_PEACEKEEPING,6454;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,6;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,147;USPEC_POLICY1,96;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,96;TAX_FNCACT_EXECUTIVES,3179;ECON_BITCOIN,338;ECON_BITCOIN,6544;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,2758;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,2758;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,2758;ECON_ENTREPRENEURSHIP,3404;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATORS,6595;TAX_FNCACT_WRITER,140;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,3019;WB_698_TRADE,925;LEGISLATION,5359;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,1601;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,2126;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,2569;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,2889;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,3944;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,5563;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,6147;EPU_POLICY_REGULATION,6321;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,1601;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2126;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2569;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,2889;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,3944;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,5563;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,6147;EPU_CATS_REGULATION,6321;UNREST_CRACKDOWN,6609;",Washington;Vermont;United States,1300

View more opinion on CNN. “Jesse was real. I’m a real mom.”  It’s an unthinkable statement for a grief-stricken parent to have to make: testifying that her 6-year-old son, murdered while he sat in school, had actually lived, and that she was the woman who had given birth to him and raised him for the too-few years he was alive. But that was the testimony Scarlett Lewis gave this week at a hearing to determine damages against Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and media personality. (Jones was held responsible for defamation in a default judgment earlier this year.)  After 20 children and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jones began to spin lurid conspiracies that the shootings never happened and that the shattered families were simply actors. The conspiracy triggered years of harassment as conspiracists targeted the mourning parents, who have had to hire security to protect themselves. Since the defamation suits were filed, Jones has apologized and claimed he was in the grip of a “form of psychosis” that caused him to believe the conspiracy theory. The Sandy Hook conspiracy made Jones the talk-radio equivalent of the Westboro Baptist Church, which staged vile anti-gay protests at soldiers’ funerals. But within just a few years, Jones would become part of the right-wing power structure, from his interviews with soon-to-be president Donald Trump to his alleged role as an organizer at the January 6 insurrection.  More than that, many in the Republican Party and conservative movement increasingly sound like Jones, with talk of false flags, crisis actors and pedophile rings now a mainstay of right-wing rhetoric. And while the Trump presidency opened the door for the mainstreaming of Jones, it’s important to understand how ripe the GOP was for Alex Jonesification.  From its beginning in the 1940s and 1950s, the modern conservative movement embraced a conspiratorial mindset. From books that argued former President Franklin Roosevelt allowed the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor to unite Americans behind him in war, to the anti-fluoridation conspiracies of the John Birch Society, to the communist-around-every-corner witch hunts of the McCarthy era, conspiracy theories have become a core component of conservatism in America. But with the exception of McCarthyism, the conspiracy-minded right remained distinct from the Republican Party. Even right-wing politicians, especially those eyeing the presidency, shied away from the wild-eyed conspiracy-mongers popular with their conservative base.  That changed in the 1990s, as politics, entertainment and conspiracy became increasingly intertwined. Pat Robertson, the televangelist who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, published his conspiracy tract, “The New World Order,” in 1991. Drawing from several decades’ worth of conspiracies about “one-world government,” Robertson detailed a coalition of the Trilateral Commission, Illuminati, Bilderberg Group, Free Masons and others working to bring about a single global governance and, ultimately, the End Times. It was a New York Times bestseller.  Robertson wasn’t the only Republican presidential candidate warning about the new world order. It became a staple of Pat Buchanan’s speeches in all three of his presidential runs between 1992 and 2000. And while the phrase spoke to anxieties about the geopolitics of a post-Cold War world, it also nodded to the conspiracy theories that were becoming increasingly popular not just among the conservative base but for Republican officeholders as well. During the Clinton years, members of Congress held inquiries into black helicopters (a staple of 1990s conspiracies) and mainlined countless conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton.   Outside of Congress, the newly powerful right-wing radio of the 1990s and 2000s likewise paved the way for an embrace of Jones. Glenn Beck’s radio program cycled through conspiracies with breathtaking speed, pinging from Common Core to George Soros to Agenda 21, a United Nations-based conspiracy theory. He mixed politics and conspiracy not only in his content but his advertising.  Warning that the End Times were near, that catastrophe lurked around every corner, Beck pushed everything from gold to food storage to “survival seeds,” all aimed at helping listeners survive the impending collapse of society. (In the years since, Beck has admitted that he “played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart.”) These threads came together in the Obama years, as Beck became one of the most prominent voices in the Tea Party movement and conspiracism ran rampant on the right. That provided real opportunity for someone like Jones to make headway in US politics. While his grotesque Sandy Hook conspiracies did not gain traction in Republican circles, others did, such as the Jade Helm 15 conspiracy of 2015. Jones turned the routine military exercise in Texas into a new conspiracy theory, telling his audience falsely that it was a covert government effort to prepare for martial law.  That conspiracy theory quickly escaped InfoWars circles, making its way to right-wing talk radio and to Republican politics. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state militia to monitor the exercise. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, preparing for a presidential bid, also legitimated the conspiracy, saying that while he’d been assured by the military that it was a routine training exercise, “I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don’t trust what it is saying.”  Cruz’s pivot helps explain why the space between Jones and the GOP collapsed in the 2010s. The Republican Party spent decades arguing that government was corrupt, if not illegitimate, and grew increasingly reliant on right-wing media for the party’s messaging. So, it took very little effort to tip over into the world of wild conspiracies – especially once, with the election of Trump, Republicans realized there would be no price to pay for doing so.  The last few years have suggested that the bill is coming due – Trump lost the presidency and the Congress, Jones lost his defamation trial and several right-wing media outlets are facing hefty defamation suits for their election conspiracies.

427,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/dan-newhouse-doug-white-washington/,"Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse and Democrat Doug White will advance to the general election out of the top-two primary in Washington’s 4th Congressional District, CNN projects. Newhouse is one of the 10 Republican House members who voted for then-President Donald Trump’s impeachment in January 2021 following the attack on the US Capitol. Trump had endorsed Republican challenger Loren Culp in the district.  Washington holds open primaries in which all candidates, regardless of party, appear on the same ballot, with the top two finishers advancing to the November general election. Despite facing anger from his own party over his impeachment vote, Newhouse had a number of factors going his way this week: The incumbent handily outspent his challengers, the field was large and fractured, and Washington state’s open primary system allowed people to vote for any candidate, regardless of affiliation. Newhouse’s victory is a loss for Trump, who made defeating the 10 House Republicans who joined Democrats to impeach him a central goal to his post-presidency. By moving on from the primary, Newhouse is likely to keep his congressional seat. His district, which stretches from Washington’s borders with Oregon and Canada, overwhelmingly leans toward Republicans. Aside from White and Culp, the field also included former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler and state Rep. Brad Klippert. Local Republican operatives, many of whom censured and criticized Newhouse after his impeachment vote, worried that many people had moved on from impeachment and caused Republicans to focus on other issues as they went to the polls on Tuesday. Newhouse also seized on his agriculture expertise, using it to appeal in the largely rural district and draw some of the focus away from impeachment.

366,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/tech/uber-q2-earnings/,"Even higher gas prices and soaring inflation aren’t slowing down Uber’s rebound from the worst days of the pandemic.  Uber\n            \n                (UBER) on Tuesday said its revenue hit $8.1 billion during the three months ending in June, more than doubling from the year prior as more customers turn to the ride-hailing service.  The number of consumers and drivers using its platform are “at all-time highs,” the company said in its quarterly earnings report. Uber recorded 122 million people using its platform each month, up 21% from the prior year. Perhaps more stunning for a company with a history of substantial losses is that Uber said it had become cash flow positive, meaning it took in more money from its operations than it spent, excluding capital expenditures, which typically includes property and other physical assets. The company said it generated $382 million in free cash flow during the quarter. But Uber continued to be unprofitable in large part due to its investments. Uber recorded a net loss of $2.6 billion, much of which ($1.7 billion) was related to its investments in other, international ridehail businesses like Didi and Grab. (Didi, in particular, has been hit by a tremendous amount of regulatory pressure in China.) Uber’s business offers a unique window into consumer trends more than two years into the pandemic which initially decimated demand for travel (hurting Uber’s Rides business) and accelerated adoption of online food delivery (helping its Eats business). During the previous quarter ending in March, the company reported that its Rides bookings had exceeded pre-pandemic levels and delivery bookings were up 12% year-over-year. Uber has continued to push its delivery offerings. Late last month, Uber announced a new grocery ordering service. While ordering groceries through Uber Eats has been available on the platform for two years, the update includes new options to incentivize use, such as advanced scheduling of deliveries, live order tracking and product replacements recommendations. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement accompanying the results Tuesday that the company “delivered balanced growth” and did so “on a platform that’s larger than ever, with the number of consumers and earners using Uber now both at all-time highs.”  “No one wishes for a tough economic environment or elevated inflation that’s affecting so many of us, including Uber drivers,” Khosrowshahi added on a conference all with analysts Tuesday. But he said the economic environment has allowed Uber to show its strengths. Shares of Uber jumped more than 15% in early trading Tuesday following the results.  Uber’s results come as much of the tech industry is turning to hiring freezes and layoffs in an effort to weather a financial downturn marked by soaring inflation, rising interest rates, fears of a looming recession as well as the fallout from war in Ukraine. Khosrowshahi told staff in May that the company would cut costs and rethink its approach to hiring amid a “seismic shift” in the market. On the call Tuesday, Khosrowshahi stressed that the company can be, and has been, diligent about its expenses and still continue to grow. He also noted that Uber benefits not only from its size but also from its range of business offerings. “When we look at the competitive environment, this is the strongest we felt competitively globally since Nelson and I probably started here,” Khosrowshahi  said, referring to himself and the company’s CFO, Nelson Chai. Khosrowshahi has been at the helm of Uber since 2017. In a striking departure from the growth-at-all-costs model Uber popularized years ago, Khosrowshahi also noted: “You can’t spend your way to glory in any business.” Khosrowshahi said Uber has been able to “apply discipline” as it makes improvements to the platform to serve drivers better. That includes better onboarding to make it easier for workers to sign up and an easier way to toggle between driving and delivering. “Right now, the machine is working,” he said. Last week, Uber announced it would expand its Upfront Fares feature to more cities in the United States to give drivers more information about earnings and the customer’s destination before accepting a ride. Khosrowshahi said on the call that this feature is one of the top requests from drivers, while noting that “there’s a lot of algorithmic work that has to go into pricing that trip properly.”",Nelson Chai;Dara Khosrowshahi,Cnn;United States,"ARMEDCONFLICT,2930;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,2930;ECON_INFLATION,47;ECON_INFLATION,2412;ECON_INFLATION,2843;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,47;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2412;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,2843;WB_442_INFLATION,47;WB_442_INFLATION,2412;WB_442_INFLATION,2843;EPU_ECONOMY,2379;EPU_ECONOMY,2553;GENERAL_HEALTH,115;GENERAL_HEALTH,1427;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,115;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1427;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,115;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1427;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,115;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1427;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,115;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1427;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,115;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1427;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,115;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1427;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,115;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1427;FUELPRICES,27;ECON_GASOLINEPRICE,27;ECON_HEATINGOIL,27;ECON_EARNINGSREPORT,413;ECON_INTEREST_RATES,2867;EPU_POLICY_INTEREST_RATES,2867;EPU_CATS_MONETARY_POLICY,2867;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,1315;TAX_ECON_PRICE,27;WB_698_TRADE,2651;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1361;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1499;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1572;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3304;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,3745;PROTEST,3599;STRIKE,3599;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2107;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,3056;AFFECT,2427;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,3932;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2391;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2565;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3361;TAX_FNCACT_CFO,3516;TAX_FNCACT_ANALYSTS,2521;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,863;WB_713_PUBLIC_FINANCE,863;WB_718_PUBLIC_INVESTMENT_MANAGEMENT,863;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,321;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,2466;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,3862;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,4168;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVERS,4338;",Ukraine;China;United States,911

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Justice Samuel Alito stirred controversy with a speech at Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome last week. The video of the event was publicized Thursday by the school.  In what began as a serious speech about the need to protect religious liberty, Alito mocked foreign leaders who criticized the controversial decision he authored in the Dobbs v. Jackson case, which ended a federal right to abortion last month.  He then told his audience of mostly friendly law professors on a Roman holiday, “I had the honor this term of writing, I think, the only Supreme Court decision in the history of that institution that has been lambasted by a whole string of foreign leaders who felt perfectly fine commenting on American law…”  “One of these was former Prime Minister Boris Johnson,” Alito said before pausing for comedic effect. “But he paid the price,” he went on to add, in reference to Johnson’s resignation earlier this month.    Undoubtedly emboldened by the scattered laughter and light applause inspired by his Boris Johnson snipe, Alito then followed with a comment that fell completely flat. “But what really wounded me, what really wounded me, was when the Duke of Sussex addressed the United Nations and seemed to compare the decision, whose name may not be spoken, with the Russian attack on Ukraine.”    The Ukraine comment elicited an uncomfortable silence, which seemed to indicate the audience was confused about whether the story was meant to be funny or merely a reflection of Alito’s seemingly low opinion of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.  Alito’s comments about the Prime Minister and the Duke of Sussex were inappropriate for any Supreme Court Justice speaking in a foreign country or, for that matter, even in the United States. The court usually declines ruling on issues that involve foreign policy as the Constitution generally leaves these matters exclusively to the president, with the occasional advice and consent of Congress. There is no mention in the Constitution of roving Supreme Court Justices attacking foreign leaders who disagree with the court’s pronouncements.  This is a critical time for the reputation and stability of the Supreme Court, given the substantial anger expressed by many Americans concerning the reversal of Roe v. Wade after 49 years. There have been “court-packing” proposals supported by many in Congress. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Joe Biden have suggested a commission to study the idea. The proposal would increase the number of Supreme Court justices, thereby diluting the power of the court’s current conservative wing. With his speech in Rome, Alito demonstrated that he is no Antonin Scalia, whose wit and charm in public speaking appearances impressed many, including even those who disagreed with his conservative politics. Lots of Americans were undoubtedly surprised that Alito or any Supreme Court justice would be permitted to make public comments about a recent Supreme Court decision. Televised congressional hearings concerning nominees appointed to the Supreme Court have schooled Americans that they will always decline or deflect direct answers relating to any issue that may come before the court.   At his own confirmation hearing in 2006, Alito deflected questions about Roe v Wade with a version of an answer given by many other conservative nominees to the court saying that the decision was “an important precedent of the Supreme Court” and “it has been on the books for a long time.” This answer was then supplemented by an Alito comment suggesting that he wouldn’t pre-commit to his position on future cases because he wouldn’t want any litigant to believe he had already made up his mind about a case without first hearing the facts. Many Americans were probably shocked to hear a Supreme Court justice making a public speech of any kind. Although the justices do occasionally make public speeches, they are normally scrupulous in avoiding any discussion of issues related to pending or prospective cases. And issues regarding abortion are always on the docket of federal courts across the nation on their potential journey to the Supreme Court. The Dobbs v. Jackson case will not end litigation concerning the nuances of abortion-related laws throughout the nation.  Public confidence in the court does not require justices to avoid all speech-making, but it does require them to be sensible and discreet in the topics they choose. Alito has demonstrated extraordinarily bad judgment in discussing the Roe v. Wade controversy in a foreign nation, even in jest, while cases related to the abortion issue are pending in the United States. Discussions concerning this important issue by Supreme Court justices should take place in open and public American courtrooms rather than before a private group in the auditorium of a foreign nation.

339,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/defense-department-missing-january-6-texts/,"The Defense Department wiped the phones of top departing DOD and Army officials at the end of the Trump administration, deleting any texts from key witnesses to events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, according to court filings.  The acknowledgment that the phones from the Pentagon officials had been wiped was first revealed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit American Oversight brought against the Defense Department and the Army. The watchdog group is seeking January 6 records from former acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, former chief of staff Kash Patel, and former Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, among other prominent Pentagon officials – having filed initial FOIA requests just a few days after the Capitol attack.  Miller, Patel and McCarthy have all been viewed as crucial witnesses for understanding government’s response to the January 6 Capitol assault and former President Donald Trump’s reaction to the breach. All three were involved in the Defense Department’s response to sending National Guard troops to the US Capitol as the riot was unfolding. There is no suggestion that the officials themselves erased the records.  The government’s assertion in the filings that the officials’ text messages from that day were not preserved is the latest blow to the efforts to bring transparency to the events of January 6. It comes as the Department of Homeland Security is also under fire for the apparent loss of messages from the Secret Service that day.  Miller declined to comment. Patel and McCarthy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The US Army Public Affairs media relations chief, Col. Cathy Wilkinson, said in a statement that, “It is our policy not to comment on ongoing litigation.”  Paul Ney, former general counsel for the Department of Defense, told CNN that Tuesday’s revelation is the “first I’ve heard about DoD litigation in which there is any issue with the cell phone I turned in when I left DoD on January 20, 2021.  “I did not wipe the phone before I turned it in (or ever that I can recall),” Ney continued. “When I turned the phone in, I did not know what was going to be done with that device nor do I know what actually was done with that device after I turned it in. If DoD represented in litigation that the device was wiped after I left DoD on Inauguration Day, I believe that is very likely what happened and when it happened, but I do not know why.” American Oversight is now calling for a “cross-agency investigation” by the Justice Department to investigate destruction of the materials.  “It’s just astounding to believe that the agency did not understand the importance of preserving its records – particularly [with regards] to the top officials that might have captured: what they were doing, when they were doing it, why they were doing, it on that day,” Heather Sawyer, American Oversight’s executive director, told CNN.  Sawyer said that her organization learned the records were not preserved from government attorneys earlier this year, and that acknowledgment was then memorialized in a joint status report filed with the court in March.  “DOD and Army conveyed to Plaintiff that when an employee separates from DOD or Army he or she turns in the government-issued phone, and the phone is wiped,” the government said in the filing. “For those custodians no longer with the agency, the text messages were not preserved and therefore could not be searched, although it is possible that particular text messages could have been saved into other records systems such as email.”  The acknowledgment that the records were not preserved has taken on new significance in the wake of the ongoing scandal over the loss of Secret Service agents’ texts from January 6.  “It just reveals a widespread lack of taking seriously the obligation to preserve records, to ensure accountability, to ensure accountability to their partners in the legislative branch and to the American people,” Sawyer said.  The Secret Service has said that its texts were lost as a result of a previously scheduled data migration of its agents’ cell phones that began on January 27, 2021, exactly three weeks after the attack on the US Capitol. Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph Cuffari first learned those texts were missing as early as May 2021, CNN previously reported.  The pattern across multiple agencies has prompted her organization to write to Attorney General Merrick Garland, who is already facing a request from congressional Democrats that he take over the DHS’ probe into the missing Secret Service texts.  “American Oversight accordingly urges you to investigate DOD’s actions in allowing the destruction of records potentially relevant to this significant matter of national attention and historical importance,” the letter said, while citing calls from Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin that the Department of Homeland Security be investigated for similar failures, the letter, shared with CNN on Tuesday, said.  After filing the FOIA requests with the Defense Department and the Army, American Oversight says the Pentagon acknowledged the request on January 15, 2021. American Oversight then filed a lawsuit that March to force disclosure of the records. In addition to the FOIA obligations American Oversight says the Pentagon has ignored in failing to preserve the records, Sawyer also pointed to a separate federal records law also require that the government preserve records that have “informational value of the data in them.”  “I think it’s highly unlikely that anyone could argue with a straight face that communications happening between these top officials on January 6 would not have the type of informational value that the Federal Records Law is meant to reach,” Sawyer said. American Oversight is seeking records for several other Pentagon officials – some of whom remain within government service.  “For those custodians still with the agency, Army has initiated a search for text messages responsive to the FOIA requests, and estimates completing their supplemental search by the end of September,” the Justice Department said in the July joint filing said in the case.  A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. What the Pentagon was hearing from the White House as the Capitol attack unfolded has been a focus of the House January 6 investigation, and lawmakers say that addressing the security lapses of that day is an aim of their probe. The House January 6 committee last week released testimony Miller gave to the panel denying that former President Donald Trump ever game him a formal order to have 10,000 troops ready to be deployed to the Capitol on January 6. “I was never given any direction or order or knew of any plans of that nature,” Miller said in the video. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment on records related to the Pentagon. A former Defense Department official from a previous administration told CNN that it is ingrained into new hires during their onboarding that their work devices were subject to the Presidential Records Act and indicated their communications would be archived. The source said it was assumed when they turned in their devices at the end of their employment, any communication records would be archived. This story has been updated with additional details.

564,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/09/entertainment/bob-odenkirk-cpr-intl-scli/,"Bob Odenkirk has said he would have been “dead in a few minutes” if he had not received CPR after suffering a heart attack on the set of “Better Call Saul” last year.  In July 2021, Odenkirk collapsed on the Albuquerque, New Mexico, set while filming the sixth and final season of the show. He later confirmed that it had been due to a “small heart attack.” The star, who has been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and Emmy Awards for playing the titular character, has now revealed that he stopped breathing during the frightening episode but was saved thanks to emergency medical care on set.  Though he cannot recall the immediate aftermath of the incident, he now knows it happened at around 5:30 p.m. when the cast and crew were changing shots. At that time Odenkirk, now 59, mounted an exercise bike he used between shoots to watch a Chicago Cubs baseball game on TV, he said. In an interview with the Radio Times magazine this week, the actor recalled: “I went down on one knee, and then I went all the way down. I guess I said, ‘I don’t feel very good.’” The star, who plays con-artist-turned-lawyer Jimmy McGill who takes on the pseudonym Saul Goodman, said his co-stars Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler, and Patrick Fabian, who plays Howard Hamlin, grabbed his head and hand and “started yelling at me to stay on Earth.” “I wasn’t breathing,” he continued. “I mean, if nobody had been there, if they didn’t do that CPR, I’d have been dead in a few minutes.” He had three shots of the defibrillator then emergency surgery to clear the artery he called “the widowmaker.”   “Better Call Saul” is a prequel to the AMC hit “Breaking Bad,” which ran for five seasons between 2008 and 2013. That show introduced Odenkirk as Goodman, an attorney for Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston. In the final season of the show, actors Cranston and Aaron Paul reprise their “Breaking Bad” roles of White and Jesse Pinkman. Odenkirk told the Radio Times that the reunion was “the greatest joy ever,” adding: “The first episode I did on ‘Breaking Bad’ was a big scene with those guys in the desert, at 2 a.m., in a sandstorm. So to revisit the relationship now … I can’t say more than that. Because it’s a mindblower, man.” The series finale is scheduled to air on August 15.",Patrick Fabian;Saul Goodman;Howard Hamlin;Bob Odenkirk;Bob Odenkirk;Bob Odenkirk;Rhea Seehorn;Jimmy Mcgill;Kim Wexler;Walter White;Bryan Cranston;Bryan Cranston;Bryan Cranston;Aaron Paul;Aaron Paul;Aaron Paul;Jesse Pinkman,Cnn,,Albuquerque;New Mexico;Chicago,542
345,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/us/wisconsin-tubing-stabbing-suspect-charged-with-homicide/,"The suspect accused of stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death and injuring four others while they were tubing in a Wisconsin river Saturday appeared in criminal court Monday, charged with intentional homicide. Nicolae Miu, 52, has been charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide and four counts of first-degree intentional attempted homicide, according to court records. Jeremiah Harrelson, a state public defender at the hearing, said Miu was tubing on the river with his wife and friends when they were separated as he was searching for a lost cellphone.  The attack stemmed from an “unanticipated random encounter” between Miu and the victims, Harrelson said. Miu said he acted in “self-defense,” the complaint said.  The complaint states Miu had brandished a knife when two females confronted him before a physical altercation broke out. One victim told investigators she was punched by Miu in the face, which gave way to a physical struggle as the group proceeded to push Miu, who fell into the water after he was punched by a male. Miu, who repeatedly called the attack “self-defense,” told Brandie Hart, a lieutenant with St. Croix County court, he approached the group while searching for the cellphone with his snorkeling gear to ask if they had seen the device. He said they started insulting him, took his snorkel gear, threw it into the river and attempted to pull his pants down, according to the complaint. Miu said he doesn’t remember anything after people hit him and got on top of him until he ran back to his wife and friends, according to the complaint. Miu was arrested about an hour and half after the attack as he was exiting the river downstream. The 17-year-old who died in the stabbing was identified in a statement by his family to CNN affiliate KARE as Isaac Shuman. “Isaac entered every room with a big smile, infectiously positive aura and lifted everyone around him up,” the statement reads. “He had an incredibly bright future ahead of him, and we are all heartbroken and devastated beyond words that his future has been tragically and senselessly cut short.” Miu’s next court appearance is scheduled for August 5, according to court records.",Jeremiah Harrelson;Brandie Hart;Nicolae Miu;Isaac Shuman,Cnn;Cnn,"TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,829;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,829;TAX_FNCACT_CRIMINAL,171;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1065;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,62;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_LIEUTENANT,1321;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT,1321;WB_137_WATER,1201;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIM,1046;TRIAL,27;KILL,604;KILL,683;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,604;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,683;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,604;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,683;SOC_GENERALCRIME,199;SOC_GENERALCRIME,264;ARREST,1789;WOUND,73;TAX_FNCACT_PUBLIC_DEFENDER,442;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,442;WB_840_JUSTICE,442;WB_942_ACCESS_TO_JUSTICE,442;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,627;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,706;",Wisconsin River;Wisconsin,454
241,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/investing/robinhood-berkshire-hathaway-trading/,"It’s no secret that Warren Buffett isn’t a fan of Robinhood.  The Oracle of Omaha has been sparring with the online brokerage platform since 2021. Until now, the fight has been over a difference in their philosophical views of the stock market.  A recent paper by three academics may have made it more personal, though.  At more than $440,000 per share, there typically isn’t a lot of trading activity around Buffett’s prized Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) A stock: Between 2010 and 2020, an average of 375 shares were exchanged daily. Then, in February 2021, trading volume shot up to nearly 2,000 shares per day, where it’s remained ever since.  The increased activity captured the attention of market watchers but remained a mystery. Some speculated that there was a superbuyer scooping up the stock.  But research published last month by professors at University of California, Berkeley, Columbia Law School and Cornell University found that the turbo boost in trading hasn’t been the result of any superbuyer. Instead, volumes of the most expensive stock in the US have been artificially inflated by the way brokers like Robinhood report fractional trading. The increases come from what researchers call “phantom, non-existent trading.” When a brokerage makes a private, off-exchange stock trade, like the fractional trades executed by Robinhood, they are required to report the trades to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as though they were for a full share. Under this “rounding up rule” an investment as small as 1/100th of a share in Berkshire Hathaway would count as a purchase of a full $440,000 share.   Researchers say that this “well-intentioned but misguided” FINRA rule has added an additional volume equivalent of more than a billion dollars a day to Berkshire Hathaway A shares. The reported phantom volume represents 80% of their daily trading volume. DriveWealth, which processes stock trades for investing apps like Cash App, also reported fractional share trades in Berkshire to the FINRA database and drove up trade volume, the study found. “The FINRA reporting rule for fractional trading has created significant distortions,” wrote the authors of the paper.  A FINRA representative told CNN Business that the agency “is already actively working on the issue, and is engaged in ongoing discussions with firms and regulators.”  Fractional trading brokerages like Robinhood, meanwhile, are “a fly in the ointment,” to Buffett, Robert Bartlett, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and co-author of the study.  “Buffett wants to keep the price of his Class A shares high to attract long-term value investors,” he said. “Those aren’t the people buying these fractional shares, and so they are undermining his main vision for the stock.”  ‘Adversaries’ of change vs. ‘casino’ groups  Buffett doesn’t mince words when speaking out against Robinhood. The brokerage is “a very significant part of the casino aspect, the casino group, that has joined into the stock market in the last year or year and a half,” he said at his Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in 2021, referring to the recent meme-stock craze.  Charlie Munger, Buffett’s right-hand man, joined in at this year’s shareholder meeting, calling the brokerage’s  business model “disgusting.”  Robinhood counters that it is “democratizing” Wall Street by creating an easily accessible trading platform that allows investors to engage in fractional trading, buying small percentages of stock shares.  “There is an old guard that doesn’t want average Americans to have a seat at the Wall Street table so they will resort to insults,” the company said in a statement last year.  “Adversaries of this future and of change are usually those who’ve enjoyed plentiful privileges in the past and who don’t want these privileges disrupted,” Robinhood added, saying that the “new generation of investors aren’t a ‘casino group.’” Either way, Robinhood may have other troubles ahead.  Robinhood announced on Tuesday that it will lay off about 23% of its staff following a sharp decline in trading activity on the platform. This is the second round of layoffs this year and part of a broader reorganization effort led by CEO Vlad Tenev.",Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Robert Bartlett;Charlie Munger,University Of California;University Of California;Columbia Law School;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Berkshire Hathaway;Financial Industry Regulatory Authority;Cnn;Cornell University,"TAX_ECON_PRICE,1030;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,1981;WB_667_ICT_INFRASTRUCTURE,1981;WB_669_SOFTWARE_INFRASTRUCTURE,1981;WB_2945_DATABASE,1981;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,1981;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSOR,2438;KILL,1314;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,892;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2503;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,892;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2503;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1394;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICANS,3521;SCIENCE,1182;SCIENCE,1613;TAX_FNCACT_GUARD,3486;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,1405;WB_698_TRADE,378;WB_698_TRADE,537;WB_698_TRADE,950;WB_698_TRADE,1138;WB_698_TRADE,1217;WB_698_TRADE,1820;WB_698_TRADE,2074;WB_698_TRADE,2327;WB_698_TRADE,3355;WB_698_TRADE,3418;WB_698_TRADE,4040;EDUCATION,270;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,2169;TAX_FNCACT_REGULATORS,2306;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,4165;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,830;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,913;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,2456;TAX_FNCACT_RIGHTHAND_MAN,3161;LEGISLATION,885;LEGISLATION,2510;EPU_POLICY_LAW,885;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2510;TAX_FNCACT_PROFESSORS,816;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,3161;WB_290_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_ORGANIZATIONAL_DESIGN,3245;WB_288_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_SECTOR_POLICY_AND_REGULATION,3245;WB_286_TELECOMMUNICATIONS_AND_BROADBAND_ACCESS,3245;",California;Berkeley;Americans,894
13,https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/25/world/europe/uk-terror-arrests/,"Nine men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, London’s Metropolitan Police said Thursday. The men, ages 22 to 51, were detained Thursday morning in London on suspicion of being members of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism. They were taken to police stations in central London and remain in custody, a police statement said. Eighteen homes, business premises and community buildings across London are being searched as part of the investigation. Officers are also searching a home in Stoke on Trent in the English Midlands. “These arrests and searches are part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist related terrorism and are not in response to any immediate public safety risk,” said the Met Police statement. Police did not give the identities of those arrested nor name the banned organization concerned. But the UK’s Press Association news agency cited sources as saying radical British cleric Anjem Choudary was among those arrested. Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN last month that the world had been split into two camps. There’s a “camp which believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to God. They are the Islamic State, at the head of which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,” Choudary said. “In the other camp you have those people who believe sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man. At the head of that camp is Barack Obama.” “I believe this Islamic State will spread, rapidly, and I believe it will be in Europe and even America within decades.” Cameron lays out plans to counter UK jihadi threat Parliament recalled UK Prime Minister David Cameron called Wednesday for Parliament to be recalled Friday to debate the nation’s response to a request from the Iraqi government for airstrikes to support operations against ISIS in Iraq. Speaking in New York, where he’s attending the U.N. General Assembly, Cameron said he was convinced that ISIS is “a direct threat” to Britain and that the nation should join international efforts against the group in Iraq. “What we are doing is legal, it is right, it does not involve British combat troops on the ground. But as ever with our country when we are threatened in this way, we should not turn away from what needs to be done,” he said. “I am confident we will get this through Parliament on an all party basis, and I think it is right for our country to be united at this time.”  Any action against ISIS in Syria would require a separate parliamentary debate and vote, he said.  Terror threat level raised The Home Office has listed 60 international proscribed terrorist organizations as of August 2014.  They include networks such as ISIS and al Qaeda, as well as UK-based groups such as Al Muhajiroun, which emerged in 1996 and has operated under a range of other names since being disbanded in 2004. The UK Home Office last month raised its terror threat level from “substantial” to “severe.”  The government also announced new measures to combat the threat from Islamist extremism, including a radical new measure to ban Britons from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad. UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups.

315,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/asia/extreme-heat-migrant-workers-climate-intl-hnk-dst/,"It was mid-afternoon on a sweltering Saturday when Raj, a laborer from northwest India, started feeling dizzy as he hauled heavy bags of concrete mix and sand on a construction site in downtown Singapore.  Temperatures had reached 34 degrees Celsius (94 degrees Fahrenheit), but Raj carried on despite the heat and soon developed a splitting headache. Within minutes, he collapsed to his knees and vomited.  “I felt very weak,” Raj said. “My head was spinning and my legs (gave way).”   The 32-year-old father of two is among millions of migrant laborers in Asia working on construction sites, shipyards, mines, factories, farms and plantations, who experts say are left vulnerable due to their prolonged outdoor exposure to high heat and humidity. “The heat scares me,” said Raj, who is being identified by only his first name because he fears repercussions from his company as well as the Singapore authorities for speaking about his working conditions.  “I have no choice. I have to work to support my family.”  For years, scientists warned that the climate crisis would amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. Now, many parts of the world are experiencing dangerous levels of heat – with little relief in sight.  Countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, France and China recently issued extreme heat alerts and scientists predict even higher temperatures to come. “It’s been troubling to see events unfold the way science has predicted,” said Radhika Khosla, an associate professor at Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and Environment. “We are seeing fewer trees and more built up concrete areas that result in higher rates of heat stress, especially in vulnerable communities. “We’ve clearly not listened and adapted.”  Few places to escape the heat During recent heat waves, governments and global bodies like the United Nations advised people to remain indoors and switch on air conditioning to prevent heat-related illnesses. But that advice is all but impossible for migrant laborers and other workers who lack access to cooling technology. “Migrant workers are too often excluded and forgotten from most global conversations about the climate crisis even though they are clearly one of the most vulnerable groups at risk,” said British researcher and migrant worker rights specialist Andy Hall.  Hall highlighted concerns shared by many migrant workers on construction sites in countries like Singapore and Malaysia, who said that they were still being made to work outdoors despite extreme heat. They said they were not permitted to enter most air-conditioned public spaces like shopping malls and other buildings because of rules by landlords and tenants prohibiting their entry and to avoid complaints being made by members of the public, Hall said. Instead, they escape the heat by resting in parks or under trees, bridges and highways, he added. “They are unable to benefit from these (cool air solutions) due to systemic restrictions as well as discrimination. It’s disappointing,” Hall said. “Their welfare in the ongoing heat crisis needs to be a bigger topic of discussion.”  Prolonged heat exposure is also a problem in other Asian countries like India, which saw crop yields significantly reduced in May due to heat stress faced by farmers and workers, and Thailand – where activists say sugarcane cutters reported severe heat exhaustion in April from working long periods in the fields. Ahnaf, a laborer from Bangladesh, said he endures grueling 12-hour work days on an oil palm plantation in southern Malaysia, followed by hot, sleepless nights in an overcrowded and poorly ventilated dormitory room he shares with seven other men.  Like Raj, he is using only one name because he fears potential repercussions from his employer and the Malaysian government for complaining about his working conditions. “Working all day is tiring but it’s also hard to sleep and rest at night when it is so crowded and hot,” he said.  Jason Lee Kai Wei from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS) said that the lack of access to convenient cooling systems like air conditioning was “a matter of life and death” for many migrant workers. “If their working and living conditions do not improve, they could end up paying a high price with their lives,” he said.   Lee, also director at the NUS Heat Resilience and Performance Centre, said there were “solutions at hand,” on the part of companies that employ migrant laborers, like enforcing proper breaks during the hottest time of the day to protect workers’ health and safety. “But at the end of the day, employers must be convinced that the health and productivity (of migrant workers) can be achieved in tandem – not one or the other,” he said. “The problem is many of these work sites do not offer these solutions to workers.”   Leading Singaporean migrant worker rights activist Jolovan Wham said that the government had not imposed “stop work orders”  for migrant workers during the recent hot spell. “So companies can still insist that their workers continue even when temperatures are higher than normal,” Wham said.   Heat has always been an issue for migrant laborers, as well as domestic workers, in the city-state, he added. “They will not speak up about the terrible living and working conditions due to the heat because they are afraid,” he said.  “They carry on because at the end of the day, their jobs are too important and they can’t afford to lose work.”  Li, the owner of a construction company in Singapore, told CNN that many of his migrant workers were “severely affected” by the heat. He said they were given appropriate rest breaks but were still bound by other official protocols such as wearing heavy safety gear like helmets and thick rubber boots that trap huge amounts of heat. “It all adds up,” said Li, who didn’t want his full name published for fear of government repercussions. “The heat isn’t dying down or going away and that affects overall productivity – but we still have building projects to complete,” he said.   In an official report addressing work place heat stress, Singapore’s Manpower Ministry recommended measures including acclimatising workers to the local weather by adjusting workloads and monitoring workers for early signs of heat stress. “Working in Singapore’s hot and humid weather puts workers at an increased risk of heat injuries,” the ministry said in the report. “Employers have a duty to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, necessary measures to ensure that the work environment is safe and without risk to their employees’ safety and health.”  A spokesperson for the ministry told CNN that companies employing migrant workers are required to make provisions during periods of excessive heat and would be “subjected to enforcement actions under the Workplace Safety and Health Act if they failed to comply.”   Cooling gap between rich and poor As the climate crisis causes global temperatures to increase, the gap between rich and poorer nations is set to widen, according to a 2021 study by the Climate Impact Lab global research initiative.  “Richer populations can protect themselves from the impacts of warming but the global poor don’t have this luxury,” said Solomon Hsiang, a co-author of the paper. He added that access to air conditioning and electric fans would still remain “out of reach for more than half of the global population” in the coming decades.  In a strongly worded recent report that addressed extreme heat, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on governments to act to protect vulnerable people from “current and foreseeable harms of extreme heat.” “Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard (and) certain people are exposed to far more heat than others such as those often doing low-paying work outdoors or in hot kitchens and warehouses,” said HRW senior environment researcher Katharina Rall.  Scientists say increasing access to cooling technology for vulnerable people should be “immediate priorities” for governments around the world. “Air conditioned public spaces are go-to places during extreme heat,” said Winston Chow, an associate professor at the College of Integrative Studies at Singapore Management University. “Restricting access to cool spaces for vulnerable people like the elderly, disabled and migrant workers who spend a disproportionate amount of time outdoors working, would be the worst thing to do when heat waves are happening.”  Oxford professor Khosla pointed to the tremendous amounts of energy consumed by standard air conditioners and said that cooling technology needs to shift towards long-term sustainability. “Air conditioning is necessary given the rising levels of heat but it has to be much more energy efficient,” she said. She added that replacing air conditioning units with more eco-friendly models would be financially costly but consuming less electricity and reducing carbon footprints would go a long way in helping the environment.  “High energy efficiency models without damaging refrigerant gases that run on fossil fuel-free electricity sources are our best options,” she said. After suffering signs of heat stress, Raj said he was taken to a hospital in Singapore near the construction site where he worked.  He waited for about an hour in an air-conditioned room before being examined by a doctor and given a clean bill of health. “It was very nice and cold and I felt better,” he said. “The last time I had air conditioning was when I was on the plane to Singapore.”  “I work outdoors every day and there is no air conditioning in the dormitory. We have ceiling fans but they are (adjusted) to low speed so my friends and I rotate our sleeping arrangements so we can sleep under the fans,” he said.  “It’s not much, but at least it’s something.”",Jason Lee Kai Wei;Winston Chow;Katharina Rall;Radhika Khosla;Heather Chen;Andy Hall,Yong Loo Lin School Of Medicine;Performance Centre;United Nations;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Oxford University

600,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/us/muslim-men-file-discrimination-lawsuit-alaska-airlines-reaj/,"Two Muslim men have filed a federal discrimination suit against Alaska Airlines for being removed from a plane prior to takeoff after a passenger alerted the crew that the men were texting and speaking in Arabic. According to a complaint filed last week in federal district court, the plaintiffs, Abobakkr Dirar and Mohamed Elamin, allege they boarded a flight from Seattle to San Francisco on February 17, 2020, and after being seated in their first-class seats, they started speaking and texting in Arabic. Another passenger, who did not speak Arabic the complaint says, saw some of Dirar’s text messages and told the crew who removed Dirar and Elamin from the flight due to what they claimed to be a “ticket issue.”    Once Dirar and Elamin were off the flight, the men spoke with an Alaska Airlines manager who translated their text messages and the messages were deemed not to be a threat, but the men were subsequently surrounded by law enforcement, according to the complaint. Dirar and Elamin, the complaint says, felt humiliated for being taken off the plane and being surrounded by law enforcement while allowing other passengers to observe “humiliating Plaintiffs before their fellow passengers by unnecessarily deplaning said passengers and allowing them to observe Plaintiffs surrounded by uniformed law enforcement personnel.”   According to the complaint, they are seeking damages against the airline.  The pair was booked on subsequent flights separately to San Francisco, but Elamin had to sit in a downgraded seat and both passengers arrived at their destinations hours later than originally intended.  Dirar and Elamin’s attorney, Luis Segura, told CNN in a statement that Alaska Airlines could have handled the situation better after finding that the complaining passenger’s claims were baseless.   The airline “…could have acted responsibly by calming tensions, apologizing to our clients for their mistreatment, and allowing our clients to remain in their rightful seats, he said. “Instead, Alaska Airlines chose to pile onto the bigotry by using these two Black, Muslim American passengers as props in an admittedly unjustified, unnecessary, and self-serving display of security theater. By bringing this lawsuit, our clients not only seek justice for themselves, but also for an entire community tired of being scapegoated to justify discrimination in air travel.”   When asked why it took more than two years to file a lawsuit, Segura told CNN that in December of 2020, Alaska Airline’s counsel stated that they would be conducting an internal investigation into the matter but never reached back out to his clients. In a statement to CNN, Alaska Airlines says it takes discrimination complaints very seriously. “Our greatest responsibility is to ensure that our flight operations are safe every day, and that includes complying with federal regulations on investigating any passenger safety reports.  Since this case remains pending litigation, we’re unable to share any further comment or details at this time.” ",Mohamed Elamin;Abobakkr Dirar;Luis Segura,Alaska Airline;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines;Alaska Airlines,"TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,798;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,2563;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,2563;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,2563;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,2563;TAX_RELIGION_MUSLIM,13;TAX_RELIGION_MUSLIM,2095;TAX_ETHNICITY_MUSLIM,13;TAX_ETHNICITY_MUSLIM,2095;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,2203;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,2797;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2104;SOC_EXPRESSREGRET,1898;TRIAL,1652;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,1652;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,939;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1093;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1311;JUSTICE,2277;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,2277;DISCRIMINATION,53;DISCRIMINATION,2374;DISCRIMINATION,2691;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,53;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2374;UNGP_FREEDOM_FROM_DISCRIMINATION,2691;SECURITY_SERVICES,939;SECURITY_SERVICES,1093;SECURITY_SERVICES,1311;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,939;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1093;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1311;WB_840_JUSTICE,939;WB_840_JUSTICE,1093;WB_840_JUSTICE,1311;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,939;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1093;WB_1920_FINANCIAL_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1311;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,939;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1093;WB_328_FINANCIAL_INTEGRITY,1311;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,939;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1093;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1311;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,939;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1093;WB_2082_LAW_ENFORCEMENT,1311;USPEC_POLICY1,2860;LEGISLATION,927;LEGISLATION,1081;LEGISLATION,1299;EPU_POLICY_LAW,927;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1081;EPU_POLICY_LAW,1299;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,212;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,504;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_ARABIC,550;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,879;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,2086;",Alaska;San Francisco;American,580
387,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/world/utah-ice-age-human-footprints-discovery-scn/,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Research on ancient footprints has previously challenged what’s known about when people arrived in North America, and a new discovery could shed more light on the story. Scientists have found 88 fossilized prints belonging to adults and children, likely dating back 12,000 years, in shallow riverbeds on the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. This is only the second set of human tracks from the Ice Age to be identified in what is now the United States.  Footprints record a specific type of evidence that most people cannot get from other types of archaeological or fossil records, said Kevin Hatala, paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was not involved in the discovery.  “You can understand how large these individuals were,” Hatala said. “You can understand how they were moving. When you see multiple trackways of footprints within the same site, you can start to understand how many people were likely there.” “Were they likely traveling together or were they moving in different ways?” he added. The fossils can offer important insight on present-day populations as well, said Daron Duke, principal investigator for the research and archaeologist for the Nevada-based Far Western Anthropological Research Group. “It also connects the people ancestral to the area to the finds,” he said. An inadvertent find The discovery occurred somewhat by accident, according to Duke and Tommy Urban, a research scientist at Cornell University in New York. Duke and Urban were searching Utah Test and Training Range in early July for remnants of purposeful prehistoric campfires, which were used by ancient humans as a source of light and heat. As they were driving around the Air Force base and talking about what fossilized footprints look like, Urban noticed one and the men stopped to inspect the print. After further examination, they identified dozens more in the area.  At first, they were unsure the footprints had been made by humans. But after several days evaluating the tracks’ size, shape and stride length, the researchers determined they were the work of barefoot human adults and children. While the archeologists are still working to confirm the age of the footprints via radiocarbon dating, they believe the tracks are 12,000 years old based on the previously dated sediment layer beneath them, and the fact that the prints were exposed to the surface around the same time as artifacts found to be 12,300 years old, Duke said. Additionally, the freshwater wetlands needed to preserve the prints have not existed in the area for at least 10,000 years.  In 2021, scientists used radiocarbon dating to find that 61 footprints discovered in 2020 in White Sands National Park in New Mexico – many belonging to teenagers and young children – were 21,000 to 23,000 years old. This would mean that humans inhabited North America during the Pleistocene era, or Ice Age, around 7,500 years earlier than previously thought. “Once I realized that (the Utah tracks) were barefoot human footprints, it was very exciting,” said Urban via email. “I had been working on footprints at White Sands for the previous five years, so it was astounding to think that we had just stumbled onto a second White Sands.” Going forward, the researchers need to preserve and protect the Utah prints and find out who the prints belonged to and when exactly they are from, Duke said. A distant human connection The find is an exciting one for the field of archaeological research, said David Madsen, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada-Reno. He was not involved in the discovery.  “Now that we have this human element, the story of the very early people becomes more real. There’s more funding available, there’s more interest in it, there’ll be more recovery,” Madsen said.  The location of the latest footprint discovery is near a site in northwestern Utah where researchers found numerous human artifacts in 2015, including stone tools and the earliest evidence of human tobacco use in the world. The relics date back to around the same time the prints were made. The proximity of the sites and the fact that the evidence is likely from the same time period tells archeologists a greater story about the people who may have inhabited the area during the Ice Age, Duke said.  Additionally, learning more about the prints may offer a better understanding of the Indigenous population in the western US.  There are 21 Indigenous communities in the region, and people from these communities are helping the researchers in the examination of the footprints.  “Their perspective, presence and understanding is invaluable,” said Anya Kitterman, the Air Force Base’s cultural resource manager, in a news release. “Our shared human history and stories are what truly unites us and it’s been an unbelievable experience to walk beside those who have gone before.”  ",Anya Kitterman;David Madsen;Daron Duke;Kevin Hatala,Tommy;Anthropological Research Group;Us Air Force Utah Test;Cnn;Cornell University;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;United States;University Of Nevada,"TAX_FNCACT_MANAGER,4891;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,522;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,2281;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3182;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3596;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3817;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4104;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4176;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,4929;WB_1789_PHYSICAL_AND_CULTURAL_RESOURCES,4883;WB_901_ENVIRONMENTAL_SAFEGUARDS,4883;TAX_FNCACT_INVESTIGATOR,1318;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,451;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1887;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4854;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,542;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,3071;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,4463;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,4188;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,4188;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,4188;WB_1439_TOBACCO_USE_AND_CONTROL,4188;URBAN,1593;URBAN,1681;URBAN,1959;URBAN,3229;TAX_FNCACT_SCIENTIST,1616;MILITARY,457;MILITARY,1893;MILITARY,4860;EDUCATION,804;EDUCATION,1638;EDUCATION,3733;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,804;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,1638;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_UNIVERSITY,3733;TAX_FNCACT_ARCHAEOLOGIST,1351;TAX_FNCACT_ARCHAEOLOGIST,3715;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1233;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCIPAL,1305;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIR_FORCE_BASE,1898;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_AIR_FORCE_BASE,4865;TAX_ETHNICITY_INDIGENOUS,4579;TAX_ETHNICITY_INDIGENOUS,4635;ETH_INDIGINOUS,4579;ETH_INDIGINOUS,4635;SCIENCE,37;WB_3007_NATIONAL_PARKS,2880;WB_1833_PROTECTED_AREAS_SYSTEMS,2880;WB_1829_ECOSYSTEM_MANAGEMENT,2880;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,1822;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,2143;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMANS,3012;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2669;WB_594_WETLANDS,2669;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2669;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,386;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2299;TAX_FNCACT_CHILDREN,2947;CRISISLEX_T11_UPDATESSYMPATHY,4998;",Pennsylvania;New Mexico;Utah;Chatham;United States;America;New York;White Sands;Cornell University,1018

166,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/business/oil-prices-selloff/,"The selloff in the oil market gathered momentum Thursday on growing concerns about weakening demand for gasoline. US oil dropped 2.3% to $88.54 a barrel, the weakest settle since February 2. Brent crude, the world benchmark, fell around 3%. A government report released Wednesday unnerved oil traders by revealing an unexpected build in both crude oil and gasoline stockpiles, suggesting demand is cooling off. Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, noted that the weekly Energy Information Administration report showed a decline in refinery usage, rising gasoline inventories and a shrinking amount of gasoline supplied. “I can’t stress enough those three things are not supposed to happen in summer,” Yawger said. “It implies there is a bad demand situation out there.” The EIA report indicates that Americans are using less gasoline than they were during not just last summer (when prices were lower), but even during the summer of 2020 when Covid-19 was still restraining travel. The four-week moving average of gasoline supplied for the week ending July 29 stood at 8.6 million barrels per day, down about 9% from the same period of 2021 and slightly below the same period of 2020. the EIA said. Some people stopped driving as much when gasoline surged above $5 a gallon in mid-June. Since then, the national average for regular gas has declined 51 days in a row, dropping to $4.14 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. That is down 14 cents in the past week and 67 cents in the past month.

686,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/economy/inflation-reduction-bill-corporate-profits/,"Even as some business groups cry foul over the tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, economists at Goldman Sachs say the landmark bill will barely put a dent in massive corporate profits. To pay for historic climate investments, the legislation that passed the Senate on Sunday imposes a 15% minimum corporate tax and a 1% tax on stock buybacks. But the fallout from these tax provisions will be minimal, according to Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS). The buyback tax and minimum corporate tax will lower per-share profits next year among S&P 500 companies by just 1.5%, according to a Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) analysis published early Sunday. Companies that pay low effective tax rates – such as health care and technology firms – would see a bigger hit, the bank said. Overall, Goldman Sachs said the net fiscal impact of the Inflation Reduction Act “look very modest,” translating to less than 0.1% of GDP over the next several years. That’s because the new spending and new taxes “roughly offset,” the bank said. Citigroup\n            \n                (C) echoed that sentiment, saying the minimum tax and buyback components of the legislation will have a “minimal impact” on S&P 500 profits. Citi’s early read, the bank said, is that the 15% minimum tax will negatively impact consensus earnings estimates by just 0.42% for 2023 — and even that estimate might “overstate” the impact. CEOs weigh in The findings stand in contrast with warnings from some major business trade groups that have argued the new tax provisions will backfire. The Business Roundtable, an influential CEO lobby, said in a statement on Saturday that while it supports policies in the bill to incentivize clean energy, the minimum corporate tax would suppress domestic investment and “undermine the competitiveness of America’s exporters.” “Imposing more than $300 billion in tax increases during a downturn is the wrong policy at the wrong time,” Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the statement, noting that the US economy has faced two consecutive quarters of declining GDP and “remains at risk of a protracted economic decline.” The American Petroleum Institute, the biggest oil and gas trade group, said over the weekend it is “encouraged” by the bill’s extension and expansion of carbon capture tax credits and provisions on onshore and offshore lease sales. However, the API said much-needed permitting reform is “glaringly absent” from the bill, and criticized its tax provisions. “We remain opposed to policies that raise taxes and discourage investments in US oil and natural gas,” said API CEO Mike Sommers.",Mike Sommers;Joshua Bolten,Senate On;Goldman Sachs;Goldman Sachs;Goldman Sachs;Goldman Sachs;American Petroleum Institute,"ENV_CARBONCAPTURE,2230;TAX_FNCACT_ECONOMISTS,115;ECON_INFLATION,88;ECON_INFLATION,828;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,88;WB_1104_MACROECONOMIC_VULNERABILITY_AND_DEBT,828;WB_442_INFLATION,88;WB_442_INFLATION,828;ECON_TAXATION,60;ECON_TAXATION,335;ECON_TAXATION,345;ECON_TAXATION,395;ECON_TAXATION,472;ECON_TAXATION,496;ECON_TAXATION,673;ECON_TAXATION,1070;ECON_TAXATION,1218;ECON_TAXATION,1476;ECON_TAXATION,1689;ECON_TAXATION,1810;ECON_TAXATION,2234;ECON_TAXATION,2401;USPEC_POLICY1,60;USPEC_POLICY1,335;USPEC_POLICY1,345;USPEC_POLICY1,395;USPEC_POLICY1,472;USPEC_POLICY1,496;USPEC_POLICY1,673;USPEC_POLICY1,1070;USPEC_POLICY1,1218;USPEC_POLICY1,1476;USPEC_POLICY1,1689;USPEC_POLICY1,1810;USPEC_POLICY1,2234;USPEC_POLICY1,2401;EPU_POLICY_TAX,60;EPU_POLICY_TAX,335;EPU_POLICY_TAX,345;EPU_POLICY_TAX,395;EPU_POLICY_TAX,472;EPU_POLICY_TAX,496;EPU_POLICY_TAX,673;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1070;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1218;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1476;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1689;EPU_POLICY_TAX,1810;EPU_POLICY_TAX,2234;EPU_POLICY_TAX,2401;EPU_CATS_TAXES,60;EPU_CATS_TAXES,335;EPU_CATS_TAXES,345;EPU_CATS_TAXES,395;EPU_CATS_TAXES,472;EPU_CATS_TAXES,496;EPU_CATS_TAXES,673;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1070;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1218;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1476;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1689;EPU_CATS_TAXES,1810;EPU_CATS_TAXES,2234;EPU_CATS_TAXES,2401;ENV_OIL,2122;ENV_OIL,2497;WB_1458_HEALTH_PROMOTION_AND_DISEASE_PREVENTION,1654;WB_1462_WATER_SANITATION_AND_HYGIENE,1654;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1654;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1654;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,2433;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,1858;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,237;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,2084;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,2036;ECON_STOCKMARKET,354;GENERAL_HEALTH,694;MEDICAL,694;LEGISLATION,267;LEGISLATION,1110;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,267;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1110;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,267;EPU_POLICY_LEGISLATION,1110;ENV_NATURALGAS,2511;WB_368_LEASING,2283;EPU_ECONOMY,1968;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,34;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1434;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1517;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1887;WB_1847_CLIMATE_FINANCE,249;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,249;EPU_POLICY_SPENDING,953;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1549;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,1902;TAX_FNCACT_CEO,2526;WB_698_TRADE,1440;WB_698_TRADE,2134;EPU_CATS_HEALTHCARE,699;EPU_POLICY_REFORM,2344;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,2242;WB_382_TAX_CREDITS_AND_DIRECT_SUBSIDIES,2242;WB_376_INNOVATION_TECHNOLOGY_AND_ENTREPRENEURSHIP,2242;WB_377_FIRM_INNOVATION_PRODUCTIVITY_AND_GROWTH,2242;WB_380_FUNDING_INNOVATION,2242;",America;American;New York,542

Miller is accused of stealing alcohol in May from a Vermont home while the owners were away, according to state law enforcement.  Vermont State Police found probable cause to charge the actor with felony burglary into an unoccupied dwelling in the town of Stamford, according to a news release from police.   After being alerted to a possible burglary on May 1, police found that several bottles of alcohol had been taken from the residence, the release said. Surveillance footage and statements gave police probable cause to charge Miller, according to the release, but it gave no details.  The actor, who previously appeared as The Flash in multiple DC superhero films, was issued a citation on Sunday, according to state police spokesperson Adam Silverman.  Miller is ordered to appear in Vermont Superior Court on September 26 for an arraignment on the burglary charge, the release said.   CNN reached out to Miller’s representatives for comment but has not heard back.   The actor is starring in an upcoming “The Flash” film, which is a DC Films production. DC Films is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, which is also CNN’s parent company.  In March, Miller was arrested in Hilo, Hawaii, and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment following an incident in a bar, according to police. On April 19, the actor pleaded no contest and was fined $500 for the disorderly conduct charge, a court record shows. The harassment charge was dismissed. Correction: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong name of the company behind “The Flash.” It is a DC Films production.

Arkansas County Northern District Judge Jeremiah Bueker, 48, was in Jefferson County for “recreational travel” with his loved ones, but at some point during the trip he “ventured off alone” and was not seen alive again, according to a Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office news release. His death is being investigated as an accidental drowning, the office said. Bueker was last seen near Mud Lake, where his body was later found, the sheriff’s office reported. “After time had passed and no one had seen or heard from Bueker, worry began to set in,” the release said. “A search for Bueker by family and friends began.” After the sun set, the family had still not found Bueker, so they called 911, the release said. An extensive ground and water search was conducted late into the night and early morning by the sheriff’s office and wildlife officers with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Eventually, the search had to be paused due to low visibility, the sheriff’s office said.  On Sunday morning, the search resumed as authorities scoured the lake using boats with side-scan sonar, which allowed them to get “a birds-eye view of the water,” Sheriff Lafayette Woods Jr. said in the release. “At approximately 9:16 a.m., the side-scan sonar revealed a body on the bottom of the lake,” and deputies pulled the body from the water, the sheriff’s office said. The family helped authorities identify the recovered body as Bueker’s and an autopsy will be performed by the State Medical Examiner, the sheriff’s office said.  “I truly pray that the successful recovery of Judge Bueker’s body by our deputies and Arkansas Game and Fish Wildlife Officers brings some sense of closure to the Bueker family and those who knew him best,” Woods said. CNN has reached out to the Stuttgart District Court, where Bueker served as district judge. April Davis, the deputy coroner for Jefferson County who responded to the scene, said there were no signs of foul play. She noted the body was intact with no signs of trauma. According to Davis, a State Medical Examiner’s Office autopsy is standard procedure. The body was transported to the office on Sunday and the autopsy is expected to be performed this week, with a report expected in about three to six months, she said. Mud Lake is in Jefferson County and lies about 75 miles southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas. Correction: An earlier version of this story, along with a map, gave the wrong location for Mud Lake. It is in Jefferson County, Arkansas. CNN’s Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.

504,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/muriel-bowser-dc-national-guard-request-denied-migrants/,"The Pentagon has declined Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for aid from the DC National Guard to help with migrants entering the city by bus, according to a US defense official.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin rejected the request because the Department of Defense has “determined providing this support would negatively impact the readiness of the DCNG and have negative effects on the organization and members,” the official said. The official said grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program is sufficient. “We understand SAMU First Response has received grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program and has indicated that sufficient EFSP funds exist at this point to provide migrant assistance.” Bowser told reporters on Friday that she wants to continue to work with the Pentagon to ensure political considerations “are not a part of their decision.” The Democrat, who has served as the District’s mayor under US presidents of both parties, alluded to the use of the National Guard during the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol: “Having the experience where the use of the DC National Guard was politicized, that puts the District in unsafe territory,” she told reporters Friday. “We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs, and to assure that any political considerations are not a part of their decision,” she added. In a letter from the Department of Defense, Bowser said the Pentagon highlighted “the concern about the open-ended nature of our request, and their ability to respond to it.” “So having just looked at their letter, they appear to say a more specified request would help them understand our needs,” Bowser added. According to the office of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, more than 6,500 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 160 buses.  The city has facilitated the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a $1 million grant, the mayor said at a news conference last week. However, city officials and non-government organizations have been increasingly concerned about the pace of arrivals over recent weeks. The mayor’s office requested to convert the DC Armory, Joint Base Bolling, Fort McNair or other “suitable federal location in the National Capital Region” into a processing center for the migrants. The regional welcome center established to aid the migrants in Montgomery County, Maryland, is at capacity, according to the request. “I’ve asked for the deployment of the Guard as long as we need the Guard to deal with the crisis that we expect to escalate,” Bowser said last week. “The number of people crossing the border seeking asylum we expect to only go up. And we need to make sure that there is a national response, not an ad-hoc, city by city, state by state response.” Bowser also highlighted the differences in the situation in DC compared to other states.  “We need to ask the President for the use of our National Guard, which we know can be very helpful in these logistical matters,” she said at the time.

566,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/entertainment/i-just-killed-my-dad-review/,"As titles not to watch with the kids go, “I Just Killed My Dad” has to rank pretty high on the list. Yet there are enough twists in Netflix’s latest true-crime docuseries to keep audiences engaged, with another sensational case that’s more of a whydunit – given the killer’s immediate confession – than who. The phrase in the title was uttered in 2019 by then-17-year-old Anthony Templet, who had just shot his father in their home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Over three episodes, director Skye Borgman (also responsible for Netflix’s “Girl In The Picture”) teases out the events that preceded those actions, including allegations of abuse and child abduction, as well as the decision by Anthony’s father, Burt, to home school him and demand that he know the boy’s whereabouts at all times. “I Just Killed My Dad” thus gradually peels back layers on this sordid saga – “sordid” being the operative word for almost everything that Netflix does in the true-crime space, including its recent entries “The Most Hated Man on the Internet” and “Our Father.” What makes it all vaguely chilling is Anthony’s numb, unemotional response – seemingly convinced he hasn’t done anything wrong – and his overall manner, which indicates that not all has been right within the home. After the initial flurry of twists, the tale does bog down in the middle, giving way to Anthony’s lawyer and the prosecutor in the case trying to find a path that feels like justice given all the extenuating circumstances. As the latter notes, there’s understandable concern about appearing to sanction murder, and how letting the boy go might be perceived. (The case was resolved in 2021, but not knowing how adds to the viewing experience.) Frankly, “I Just Killed My Dad” seems to exist largely because of that attention-getting title, which weds old-fashioned exploitation movies with the fare normally found on channels like Investigation Discovery. Netflix has gone a bit overboard with these kind of docuseries in terms of sheer volume, but to be fair, so has everyone else. Moreover, these projects reliably light up social media for a lot less money than going out and hiring an all-star cast. While something like “I Just Killed My Dad” might not be the kind of material that’s fun for the whole family, it’s the sort of formula that usually ensures a trip right to the top of the service’s most-watched tier. “I Just Killed My Dad” premieres Aug. 9 on Netflix.

562,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/us/eastern-kentucky-floods-mutual-aid-cec/,"Kayla Slone hops out of the bed of her husband’s pickup truck as it stops in front of what used to be a house. A friend hands her a couple of Styrofoam takeout containers from the stacks that fill the truck, and Slone makes her way toward an elderly couple sitting outside a shed. This is all that’s left of their home after the recent floods in eastern Kentucky that left at least 37 people dead. “Ya hungry?” she calls out cheerfully. The couple is pleased to see her again. Slone has become a familiar face over the last few days, delivering scores of home-cooked meals to people in the remote reaches of Knott County. On the menu today: Sloppy Joes and corn salad. As Slone hands over the food, she notices a disassembled bed frame and mattress sitting out front. She asks if they need it put together – her husband and a friend who are out with her today have the muscles for the job, she jokes – but the couple tells her not to worry.  She also mentions that she’s working on getting them an air-conditioning unit – she suspects the couple has been sleeping in the shed, and temperatures have been unbearably hot. “Everybody’s come together and just done what we have to do to support each other,” she tells CNN. “That’s just what we do.” Slone, a hairdresser whose home in nearby Littcarr was spared from the worst of the floods, says she’s fortunate that she can afford to take time off to care for more vulnerable members of her community. Many people in eastern Kentucky were already struggling when disaster struck, and the needs right now are vast and urgent. In a region long derided and dismissed by outsiders, Slone and others in eastern Kentucky know their neighbors can’t count on support to come from elsewhere. So they’re doing what they’ve always done: Helping one another survive. People here were already struggling The homes and livelihoods wiped away by the flooding were already on shaky ground. After cycles of boom and bust over the last century, eastern Kentucky’s coal industry has declined steeply since the ’80s as companies laid off workers in favor of automation and mechanization. As demand for alternative energy sources increased and coal became less profitable to mine, many of the region’s workers were out of a job.  The miners who were still employed were prescribed opiates for pain from their injuries, a phenomenon that helped give rise to the ongoing opioid epidemic. After decades of disinvestment in the region, parts of eastern Kentucky are experiencing an exodus. Knott County and Letcher County, two of the areas hit hardest by the floods, saw their populations decline by about 12% each between 2010 and 2020, according to data from the US Census Bureau. Poverty rates in counties across the region are more than twice the national average, and unemployment rates are similarly grim. Those conditions translate to a shrinking tax base, providing local governments little funding to improve infrastructure. The beautiful, rugged landscape, a point of pride for the region, also presents challenges. Eastern Kentucky is made up of hills and “hollers,” or narrow valleys cut by streams. But the steep slopes are prone to landslides, leaving the valleys vulnerable to flash flooding. Building in the hills could mitigate flood risks, but doing so is extremely costly, says Bill Haneberg. “People have really very little choice except to live in floodplain areas,” adds Haneberg, state geologist and director of the Kentucky Geological Survey at the University of Kentucky. When historic levels of rain began to fall in late July, the creeks along the valleys turned into raging rivers, knocking already fragile homes off their foundations. The floodwaters washed away dirt roads and small bridges, and some lost their vehicles. Many were left stranded. As a warming planet threatens to make extreme weather events like this more common, there are concerns about how decades of coal mining and fossil fuel extraction have altered the region’s landscape.  “It’s likely we would have had extremely severe flooding even if there had never been a coal mine in eastern Kentucky,” Haneberg says. “The question that we don’t know the answer to is: How much might this amount of disturbance have increased the severity of the current floods?” One county formed an aid network These circumstances are part of why Slone feels so compelled to be there for her neighbors. After a few days of cooking and delivering meals with the help of her mother and sister, she realized there were people in the community who weren’t being reached. So she enlisted some friends with off-road vehicles to go into the hollers where their truck can’t. They travel deep into these remote communities to deliver meals and cleaning supplies, asking the residents they encounter how many more houses are past them. If they have to get out of the vehicle to climb their way there, they do. “A lot of people are stuck,” Slone says. “And there’s a lot of people that people don’t know that are stuck. We find people every day.” Slone funded the first day of meals herself, then called for donations to keep the work going. She says she received about $800 initially, and money kept rolling in. Soon, she was getting requests for items besides food – one person needed a propane tank so their generator could keep running their medical device, another needed to borrow a side-by-side for the day. What started as a small operation kept expanding. Another community member involved in aid efforts across Knott County reached out and asked if Slone would be willing to take the lead on addressing needs that arise in the communities of Pine Top and Caney. Slone is now part of a team of volunteers that spans the county. Group members communicate using the walkie-talkie app Voxer, and voice messages come into the chat titled “Knott Flood” all day. While on her route in Pine Top, Slone opens the app: A man wants to know if anyone has a trailer that can be used to haul a church parking lot’s worth of supplies. Slone responds that her husband has one that he might be able to borrow. In another voice message, she mentions that she’s trying to procure two AC units for residents in need. Specific requests are also coming in for her designated areas, whether someone needs diapers or toothpaste. “Even if I can’t get to it, I make sure it gets done,” Slone says.  A mutual aid group gives out cash Others throughout the region are showing up in similar ways. EKY Mutual Aid, a Facebook group that started in 2020 to help people through the pandemic, is one example. Like other mutual aid networks across the country, it’s a community of people working together to address each other’s needs – neighbors helping neighbors without a top-down leadership structure.  People post to the group about what they need – one man whose house was flooded needs money to pay for the motel where he and his kids are sleeping, another feels overwhelmed as he cares for elderly relatives and just needs someone to talk to. Other members of the group offer support as they are able. The idea is solidarity, not charity, says one of the group’s administrators Misty Skaggs. Over the last two years, EKY Mutual Aid grew from about 60 to 4,000 members, with at least half participating regularly, Skaggs says. A week-and-a-half after the floods hit, the group now exceeds 5,000 members. The numbers are relatively large for a rural region with such a small population, and Skaggs credits the community’s strength to Appalachia’s culture and history. “When you’re struggling, you learn to struggle together a little better,” she says. Community members are also giving out what many need most urgently: Money. At a makeshift supply center in downtown Whitesburg, Jessica Shelton is discussing the challenges her community is up against when a woman walks in the door. “Are you guys still handing out $200?” the woman asks. “I’ve got someone here that could use it.” Shelton, who is organizing mutual aid efforts in Whitesburg and also works closely with EKY Mutual Aid, directs her to someone who can help. The woman walks out with the funds, no questions asked.  “Giving them $200 is just saying, ‘You are worth something and you deserve this. I’m not going to ask you what you’re doing with that money, but I know you need it,’” says Shelton, who is also director of the Appalachian Media Institute at the nonprofit cultural arts organization Appalshop. She says she’s personally received about $25,000 in donations to help flooding victims, nearly $10,000 of which has been distributed as direct aid. But she stresses that she’s not alone in this work – communities all over eastern Kentucky are lifting each other up. “I know there’s people out there helping their neighbor muck out their house or lending them whatever they can,” Shelton says. “Truly everyone is doing mutual aid, whether they’re calling it that or not.” Locals feel they’ve long been overlooked In eastern Kentucky, caring for one’s neighbors isn’t just a benevolent gesture – it’s survival. “One thing that we realized over the course of mutual aid is most people around here are of the mindset that the government and these institutions that we’re supposed to rely on really don’t care if poor people live or die,” says Skaggs. “And I believe that.” That feeling of neglect runs deep in the region, resurfacing in the aftermath of the floods. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited on Monday, along with Gov. Andy Beshear and the state’s first lady Britainy Beshear. Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have been in the region surveying the damage, and the agency has announced that uninsured or underinsured people in 12 counties can apply for disaster assistance. Meanwhile, Beshear said in an August 3 news conference that the state had collected more than $3 million in donations to assist those affected by the floods, and that the state legislature was considering a special session to discuss relief. But such assistance could take time to get approved, if it gets approved at all. And for some in eastern Kentucky, these announcements are just a drop in the bucket for what’s truly needed to address the challenges facing the region. “We had a housing crisis before this flood. We’ve had environmental crises before this flood,” Shelton says. “No one that has any power to do anything has been doing anything about it – no matter how much we scream about it.” Others, like fourth-generation Fleming-Neon resident Sam Quillen, are skeptical, too. He would have liked to see some kind of federal presence sooner, and he’s unsure whether the funding that will ultimately be approved will be enough for his town to recover. “We’re kind of on the end of the spectrum of getting anything,” he says. “And that’s the way we’ve always been treated. We don’t have enough population to warrant enough clout.” Barely a week after the disaster, Quillen and others say it feels like national attention is already fading.  But many are committed to staying As Crystal Watson surveys what’s left of the Isom Vendors Mall and Flea Market, she wonders how her business – and the region – will recover. People came to the indoor antique mall in Letcher County from surrounding counties to score discounted appliances, furniture and other items. With few other economic opportunities in the area, the market that she and her husband owned for seven years also kept many of her vendors afloat.  The floods wiped out thousands of dollars in inventory, as well as entire livelihoods, Watson says. A 96-year-old woman at the market worked here for extra income, while a couple in between jobs relied on it to make ends meet.  Watson, her staff members and some friends have been working since last week to remove the mud that cakes the floor. While the destruction of the place where she spent so many of her waking hours is hard to stomach, she knows many people have it much worse. So she’s doing her best to reopen. “This is a needed thing for this area, because people can’t afford new,” Watson says. “Everybody’s on fixed incomes or they’re elderly. They need this stuff.” Others are coming to a different conclusion. In Quillen’s town of Fleming-Neon, a few elderly business owners have already told him that they don’t plan on reopening. Rebuilding will take time and money that they don’t have, and they’re better off relocating. But plenty see the potential in eastern Kentucky, and are pushing for a better future. Years ago, Slone moved for a time to Morgantown, West Virginia. It wasn’t home, though, and she soon returned. “I missed the ‘What are you putting in your pot roast?’ in the grocery store, and ‘How’s your mom?’” she says. “This is where you want to be when something happens.” Slone doesn’t know how long she’ll be cooking meals and delivering supplies to her neighbors. But as long as there’s a need, she says she’ll be out there – showing up for the people who make this beautiful, complicated region worth it.",Britainy Beshear;Jill Biden;Maris Hovee;Jessica

189,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-parliament-visit/,"During a historic trip to Taiwan Wednesday, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her visit was intended to make it “unequivocally clear” that the United States would “not abandon” the democratically governed island. China responded to Pelosi’s trip launching military exercises, which China’s Ministry of Defense said began on Wednesday with drills in both the seas and airspace surrounding Taiwan. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said 27 Chinese warplanes made incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and 22 planes crossed the median line dividing the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday – an unprecedented number since Taiwan began publicly releasing information about China’s air incursions about two years ago.  As the California Democrat departed the island on Wednesday afternoon for South Korea, there were already signs of the strains her visit to Taipei – the first by a sitting US House speaker in 25 years – had placed on Washington’s relationship with Beijing – which warned that her trip would have a “severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations.” China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has long vowed to “reunify” the island with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary.  Pelosi’s praise of the island’s commitment to democracy was a significant show of support for Taipei, coming just hours after China threatened to retaliate to her presence with a series of military exercises the Taiwanese Defense Ministry likened to a “maritime and aerial blockade.”  Beijing had repeatedly warned of dire consequences should the trip go ahead – even going as far as to warn US President Joe Biden that those who played with fire would “perish” by it. But the warnings from Beijing – and even a suggestion by Biden himself that the US military thought the trip was “not a good idea” – did not dissuade Pelosi, 82, from flying into the island alongside a congressional delegation on Tuesday evening and meeting its leading officials. “We are proud of our enduring friendship,” said Pelosi, speaking alongside Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen at the presidential office in Taipei the morning after her arrival.  “Now more than ever, America’s solidarity with Taiwan is crucial and that is the message we are bringing here today.”  In a statement released Wednesday after she left Taiwan, Pelosi said that her visit “should be seen as a strong statement that America stands with Taiwan.” China’s response Pelosi arrived to a largely warm welcome in Taipei, with the city’s tallest building, Taipei 101, lighting up with a welcome message and supporters gathering outside her hotel – though her visit to the legislature on Wednesday attracted a smattering of protesters. Video showed some people shouting, “Pelosi, get out” and holding placards reading, “Taiwan doesn’t want war.” President Tsai thanked Pelosi for visiting, praised her long commitment to democracy and human rights and bestowed on her Taiwan’s highest civilian honor. Beijing, within minutes of Pelosi’s arrival in Taipei, said it would immediately begin “a series of joint military operations around the island,” including using long-range live ammunition in the Taiwan Strait that separates the island from mainland China. China’s Ministry of Defense said the military exercises began on Wednesday, which it said involved the navy, air force and other military forces.  Taiwan’s Defense Ministry described the military exercises as “irrational” and tantamount to a “blockade.” It said the planned drills would violate Taiwan’s territorial waters, “threaten an international waterway, challenge the international order, undermine the cross-strait status quo and endanger regional security.” The Chinese incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) were made by six J-11 fighter jets, five J-16 fighter jets, and 16 Su-30 fighter jets, the Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday night. China frequently sends warplanes into Taiwan’s self-declared ADIZ. The highest number of incursions ever recorded was on October 4 last year, when 56 military planes flew into the area on the same day.  On Wednesday, as Pelosi met with Taiwan’s leaders, elbow-bumping and posing for photos, China suspended the import of citrus fruits and some fish products from Taiwan, as well as the export of sand to the island.  Chinese Customs claimed the suspension of citrus fruit imports was a result of “pest control” and “excessive pesticide residues,” and cited “Covid prevention” for the suspension on seafood imports. However, its previous bans on some Taiwanese products have often coincided with periods of escalating tensions.  ‘Taiwan will not back down’ President Tsai, like Pelosi, appeared unmoved by China’s warnings. “Facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down,” Tsai said during a televised meeting with Pelosi. “We will firmly uphold our nation’s sovereignty and continue to hold the line of defense for democracy. At the same time, we wish to cooperate and work in unity with all democracies around the world to jointly safeguard democratic values.” Taiwan would do “whatever it takes” to strengthen its defensive capabilities, Tsai added, saying she was committed to “maintaining peace and stability” in the Taiwan Strait and vowing to make Taiwan a “key stabilizing force” for regional security and the development of global trade. Pelosi told reporters Wednesday that “America stands with Taiwan” and China will “not stand in the way” of people coming to visit the island.  “We have to show the world, and that is one of the purposes of our trip, to show the world the success of the people of Taiwan,” she said. “We want Taiwan to always have freedom with security and we’re not backing away from that.” She also praised Taiwan as “one of the freest societies in the world.”  Pelosi and the US congressional delegation also met Taiwanese lawmakers, exchanging pleasantries with Taiwan’s Deputy Speaker Tsai Chi-chang before a closed-doors meeting.  Pelosi is a longstanding critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has denounced Beijing’s human rights record, and met pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy protesters. More recently, she has voiced support for the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. On Wednesday, Pelosi and the congressional delegation left the self-governed island around 6 p.m. (local), departing from Taiwan’s Songshan airport This story has been updated with additional developments.

510,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/05/politics/muriel-bowser-dc-national-guard-request-denied-migrants/,"The Pentagon has declined Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser’s request for aid from the DC National Guard to help with migrants entering the city by bus, according to a US defense official.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin rejected the request because the Department of Defense has “determined providing this support would negatively impact the readiness of the DCNG and have negative effects on the organization and members,” the official said. The official said grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program is sufficient. “We understand SAMU First Response has received grant funding through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter Program and has indicated that sufficient EFSP funds exist at this point to provide migrant assistance.” Bowser told reporters on Friday that she wants to continue to work with the Pentagon to ensure political considerations “are not a part of their decision.” The Democrat, who has served as the District’s mayor under US presidents of both parties, alluded to the use of the National Guard during the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol: “Having the experience where the use of the DC National Guard was politicized, that puts the District in unsafe territory,” she told reporters Friday. “We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs, and to assure that any political considerations are not a part of their decision,” she added. In a letter from the Department of Defense, Bowser said the Pentagon highlighted “the concern about the open-ended nature of our request, and their ability to respond to it.” “So having just looked at their letter, they appear to say a more specified request would help them understand our needs,” Bowser added. According to the office of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, more than 6,500 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 160 buses.  The city has facilitated the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a $1 million grant, the mayor said at a news conference last week. However, city officials and non-government organizations have been increasingly concerned about the pace of arrivals over recent weeks. The mayor’s office requested to convert the DC Armory, Joint Base Bolling, Fort McNair or other “suitable federal location in the National Capital Region” into a processing center for the migrants. The regional welcome center established to aid the migrants in Montgomery County, Maryland, is at capacity, according to the request. “I’ve asked for the deployment of the Guard as long as we need the Guard to deal with the crisis that we expect to escalate,” Bowser said last week. “The number of people crossing the border seeking asylum we expect to only go up. And we need to make sure that there is a national response, not an ad-hoc, city by city, state by state response.” Bowser also highlighted the differences in the situation in DC compared to other states.  “We need to ask the President for the use of our National Guard, which we know can be very helpful in these logistical matters,” she said at the time.

58,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/what-is-vote-a-rama/,"Democrats’ push to advance their energy and health care bill is likely headed for a procedural speed bump known in Washington as a “vote-a-rama.”  The time-consuming and stamina-challenging process is among the final obstacles for Democrats, along with the Senate parliamentarian’s review of the package. Politically, a vote-a-rama gives Republicans a chance to sow discord and create distractions as they force Democrats to vote on controversial issues. But, once it’s over, Democrats have the opportunity to advance their package on a straight party-line vote that would not be subject to the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold. Here’s what you need to know: What is a vote-a-rama? Usually in the legislative process, lawmakers can use a series of procedural maneuvers to avoid voting on amendments. But in a budget reconciliation process – which Democrats are using to advance their bill – you can’t do that. Lawmakers cannot hold a final vote on a reconciliation bill until all the amendments have been “disposed of,” or in simpler terms, “voted on.” The practice involves votes on a series of amendments that can – and usually do – stretch for hours. How do lawmakers use the process? The party in charge typically wants to move this vote-a-rama along as quickly as possible with as few votes as possible. The minority party takes the opportunity to force votes on all kinds of measures they don’t typically have the power to put on the floor. How long does each vote take? Usually, lawmakers agree to a process that looks a lot like this. Each amendment takes about 15 minutes or so to get through. The process moves quickly by Senate standards, which is why it is so important for members to basically stay in or close by the chamber for the entire marathon event. What’s in the bill? The bill contains a number of Democrats’ goals, including some provisions that party leaders have worked toward for years: Still, this isn’t Build Back Better 2.0. The package is less than half the size of Biden’s original social safety net plan, and a number of key Democratic priorities are likely to be left out.

474,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/lindhurst-high-school-shooting-cec/,"Angela Welch still recalls every detail. The stocky gunman in a camo ​vest. The gunshots, one after another. The piercing screams, echoing through the building. The muffled sobs.  Welch was a high school sophomore in Olivehurst, California, when a former student entered her school on a Friday afternoon with a 12-gauge shotgun in one hand, a .22-caliber rifle slung over his back and a band of ammunition on a belt.  It was May 1, 1992 – seven years before Columbine, before the days of active shooter drills, before anyone imagined a gunman entering a school and harming students would become a common occurrence.  Lindhurst High School was abuzz with anticipation – it was the day before the prom. Then, suddenly, the school erupted in chaos. The vaguely familiar young man stalked the halls, gunning down a teacher, shooting students in classrooms and holding dozens of others hostage. By the time the eight-hour siege was over, three students and a teacher were dead, and 10 people were wounded, court documents show.  The town of about 10,000 north of Sacramento was forever changed.   Authorities described the shooter, Eric Houston, then 20, as a Lindhurst High dropout who’d failed to graduate from the school three years earlier and who blamed his former history teacher, Robert Brens, for giving him a failing grade.    CNN spoke to Welch and Lynda Vanartsdalen, a former Lindhurst teacher who also survived the shooting. The two women described a drawn-out day of chaos, terror and questions that still haunt them three decades later.    Back then, attacks on schools were largely unheard of. Vanartsdalen and Welch never imagined so many other school shootings would follow.    “I can’t believe it’s still happening, 30 years later,” Vanartsdalen said.  The women said that every massacre at a school, like the recent one in Uvalde, Texas, brings back harrowing memories.  “I can feel the pain the students feel from losing a classmate,” said Welch, speaking of the Uvalde shooting. It’s a pain that may affect them for years to come, she said.    At first, she thought the shots she heard were seniors popping balloons  That afternoon, Welch recalls, she was in a history class in Building C, preparing for a quiz and chatting about summer plans with her classmates.  With the semester nearing its end, excitement filled the air.  “There were no signs of danger, no threats, everyone going about their day,” Welch said. “Seniors talking smack in the hallways about what they will do after graduation, others talking about summer vacations with friends and family, others making plans to meet up after school.”   Shortly afterward, several loud pops punctuated the students’ chatter.  Welch and her classmates initially dismissed the sounds, she said, thinking that giddy seniors were popping balloons. But the bangs got louder, Welch said, and students in the hallway started screaming.  Moments later, the gunman appeared in the doorway of her class, raised his gun and started firing. Her classmate, Beamon Hill, pushed her out of harm’s way, court documents say.   “Everything was happening so fast,” Welch said. “All I remember is Beamon instantly shoved me to the ground, taking the bullet.”  Welch fell to the floor and saw Beamon sprawled nearby, bleeding from his head, she said. She began weeping as she struggled to understand what was going on.  “Classmates yanked me behind a cabinet to hide and covered my mouth to stay quiet,” Welch said.  Before he reached Welch’s class, Houston had walked into Brens’ classroom and shot him in the chest as the teacher leaned on his desk in front of his students, court documents show.  Witnesses said Houston then turned around, pumped his weapon and shot student Judy Davis in the face and upper chest, court documents show. She tumbled from her seat to the floor. Houston left the room and gunned down senior Jason White in a hallway, then went to the world studies class, where he encountered Welch and Beamon, according to court documents.  Other than Brens, the other victims appeared to be chosen at random, authorities said. Witnesses told prosecutors Houston carried out his massacre impassively, without saying a word. ‘He was really like there was no one inside, no one home, no one in there,” student Gregory Howard later told a grand jury. “He looked like he didn’t have a soul.”   One teacher locked her classroom, turned off the lights and called 911  Vanartsdalen was in the same C building that afternoon.  In a sign of how unusual school shootings were then, one teacher later told her she initially thought the armed man was a soldier visiting from nearby Beale Air Force Base to discuss career options with students. “It was just a perfect California day, then all hell broke loose,” Vanartsdalen said. “Now every time I hear of another school shooting, my heart breaks. I know the pain and the hurt and the struggle they will go through for years to come.” A career adviser at the time, Vanartsdalen still remembers the smell of gunpowder in the hall and the sounds of students screaming. She recalls the discordant sound of birds chirping outside her office window as terrified students hid behind cabinets.   Vanartsdalen was in the career center with about two dozen students who had come to research careers during sixth period – the final one of the day, she said.  She remembers peeking outside and seeing the shooter pace up and down the hallway.  He fired again and again, unleashing a white cloud.  “There was all this popping and smoke,” Vanartsdalen said. “I can still smell the gunpowder to this day.”  Vanartsdalen removed her classroom’s door stop, closed and locked the door, and turned off the lights. She ordered the students onto the ground as gunshots and screams from other classrooms permeated the walls. She crawled across the floor, pulled a phone down from her desk and punched 911 over and over and over. No one answered, she said.  And then she and the other students waited.  “My mind was going a million miles an hour,” she said.  Some survivors fled the school and took refuge in a nearby house  Houston then herded students into an upstairs classroom in a corner of the building.  As he held them captive, he ranted about flunking out of school and blamed it on Brens, court documents said.  Meanwhile, Welch, Vanartsdalen and a group of students stayed in their hiding spots downstairs. After C building quieted down, someone opened an exit door and they all fled.  “We all ran like hell into the neighborhood, banging on people’s doors to let us in,” Welch said.  Vanartsdalen said she led Welch and a group of other students to a nearby house. In her eagerness to let the students inside, the teacher grabbed the screen door with such force that she yanked it off its hinges. The terrified homeowner was reluctant at first but allowed them to stay until Vanartsdalen could use the home’s phone to call all the kids’ parents.   After holing up in the house for hours, Welch was reunited with her father. Vanartsdalen remained at the neighbor’s house until the last child had gone home safely.  Not until she emerged three hours later and walked back to the school did she begin to comprehend the magnitude of what was happening.  “At the time, we thought we were the only survivors,” Vanartsdalen said. “Houston was still holding about 80 students hostage in a classroom, and no one knew what was going on.”  SWAT teams surrounded the building, waiting for the right moment to strike. Police and TV news helicopters hovered overhead.  As afternoon turned into dusk and the sky faded to black, a shell-shocked community awaited word on their loved ones.  The hours dragged on. Houston released a few students in exchange for soda and boxes of pizza.  He finally surrendered about 10:30 p.m., ending a tense standoff.  Vanartsdalen said she was still outside the school when authorities led him out in handcuffs.  That’s when she recognized the shooter as a student who had come to the career center a few years earlier.  She remembered a blond, withdrawn teen who barely spoke to anyone and didn’t seem to have many friends.  Three decades later, the shooting’s effects still linger  For Vanartsdalen and Welch, the impact of the tragedy lingers 30 years later.  Welch now 46, works at a hospital’s financial office in Lexington, Kentucky.  Vanartsdalen, 71, is retired and lives in Marysville, California, about five miles from Olivehurst.   Both women said surviving a school shooting heightens your alertness in a way nothing else does. Even now, every time they visit a store, restaurant, or other public place, the first thing they do is map out an exit strategy.    Vanartsdalen is wary of hovering helicopters, firecrackers and popping balloons. On a recent dinner date with her husband, she almost panicked when she noticed a man pacing anxiously in the restaurant. The moment passed without incident, but she remains vigilant about her safety.  Both women said they got weeks of counseling and therapy afterward. But back then, therapists were not as equipped to handle mass shootings.  “My therapist seemed so overwhelmed with everything, I stopped going after a while,” Welch said. “What seemed to help more was talking about it with other people in the community, both friends and strangers.”  Several months after the shooting, Welch was surprised to receive a package with an autographed photo and a note from Mariah Carey, one of her favorite singers.   “I’m so sorry to hear about your friend and the horrible situation you went through,” it said. “It’s great that you have such a positive attitude about things now.” And in 1994, Welch was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show, where she appeared with other survivors of mass shootings and shared her recollections of that fateful day.  “Oprah asked me questions about my experience and how I was handling things now. We did talk a little about Beamon,” she said. “What I remember most is her kindness … her words of encouragement to stay strong and do positive things in life.” These days, as school shootings become more common, Welch said she’s forced to replay that day over and over. Every new shooting is a trigger – and a reminder of what lies ahead for the survivors.  “Those poor kids from all these school shootings will have to learn how to live their lives going forward,” Welch said.    The women still remember those who died that day. Welch said she will never forget her classmate Beamon’s heroic act. She’s told her two children about the popular 16-year-old prankster who helped keep everyone loose and may have saved their mother’s life.  Welch said she remembers that earlier that day, Beamon had tossed a crumpled-up piece of paper across the classroom. When the teacher asked who did it, he had put on his game face and pointed at Welch. The other classmates erupted into laughter because they knew he was the culprit, she said.  “Beamon got me in so much trouble,” Welch said.  “He knew exactly how to make me smile when I was stressed before a test.”  Houston was eventually convicted of four counts of first-degree murder and remains on death row at San Quentin State Prison. The Olivehurst community has largely moved on from the shooting, Vanartsdalen said, and people there rarely talk about it, except on the anniversary.  But revisiting what happened on May 1, 1992, remains a form of therapy for her – and a way to honor those who were lost.  “Four people died that day,” she said. “We should never forget them.” ",Angela Welch;Angela Welch;Angela Welch;Angela Welch;Jason White;Lynda Vanartsdalen;Lynda Vanartsdalen;Mariah Carey;Mariah Carey;Mariah Carey;Vincent Furr;Gregory Howard;Judy Davis;Beamon Hill;Robert Brens;Robert Brens,Lindhurst High School;Lindhurst High School;Lindhurst High School;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Beale Air Force,"TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,711;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,985;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,1084;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,2207;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,3170;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,4063;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5190;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5550;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5660;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5818;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,5909;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6353;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6584;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6747;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,6970;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,7248;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,7304;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,7624;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,8050;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENTS,8420;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,416;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,2992;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,4181;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,4758;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,7564;TAX_FNCACT_STUDENT,8677;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,61;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,340;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,769;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,1537;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HIGH_SCHOOL,3443;EDUCATION,61;EDUCATION,340;EDUCATION,435;EDUCATION,692;EDUCATION,769;EDUCATION,873;EDUCATION,1398;EDUCATION,1537;EDUCATION,1945;EDUCATION,2085;EDUCATION,2929;EDUCATION,3443;EDUCATION,4996;EDUCATION,5319;EDUCATION,6669;EDUCATION,6868;EDUCATION,7851;EDUCATION,8582;EDUCATION,9199;EDUCATION,11106;EDUCATION,11308;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,61;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,340;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,435;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,692;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,769;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,873;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1398;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1537;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1945;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2085;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2929;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,3443;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4996;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,5319;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6669;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,6868;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,7851;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,8582;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,9199;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,11106;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,11308;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,61;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,340;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,435;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,692;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,769;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,873;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1398;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1537;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,1945;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2085;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,2929;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,3443;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,4996;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,5319;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6669;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,6868;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,7851;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,8582;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,9199;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,11106;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_SCHOOL,11308;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,965;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,1096;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,1448;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,1692;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,4019;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,4846;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,5028;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,7325;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,7587;TAX_FNCACT_TEACHER,11928;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,922;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,5079;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,9561;",Houston;Beale Air Force Base;Marysville;Kentucky;Lindhurst High School;Olivehurst;Sacramento;Uvalde;Texas;California;San Quentin,2498
560,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/wisconsin-senate-race/,"Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes are political opposites. But as the two prepare for what could become one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2022 cycle, they are leveling similar attacks to define each other: Casting their opponent as too extreme and out of touch with Wisconsin voters, while arguing the other is not a true representative of the state’s working class. “The problem is Ron Johnson has turned his back on working people and I’ve fought for working people my entire career, even before I was an office,” Barnes said when asked for the single biggest difference between himself and Johnson, who made millions running a plastics manufacturer before he entered public office. “His wealth isn’t the problem – it’s the fact that he is ultra-wealthy and out of touch.” Johnson’s campaign declined to make him available to CNN, but a Johnson campaign adviser previewed a notably similar message.  “(Barnes) is out of touch with where the majority of the state is,” said adviser Ben Voelkel, citing some of the more liberal positions Barnes has backed throughout his career. “Mandela Barnes talks a lot about his dad working the third shift work. … Mandela Barnes hasn’t done any of that. He has been a career political activist.” Johnson has already described Barnes as Democrats’ “most radical left candidate,” adding that “a radical left Senator from Wisconsin is not the solution.” Johnson recently called him “a progressive puppet out to fundamentally change America.” The attacks – delivered ahead of Tuesday’s Wisconsin Senate primaries, which appear to be already decided – are previews of what will likely become an acrimonious race, one that experts expect will see tens of millions spent on negative advertising as each side attempts to solidify their base voters in November. Johnson, the incumbent, faces no primary challenge after he opted to run for a third term. The senator, who promised to only serve another full term when he ran for reelection in 2016, waffled on the third term for months, but eventually decided to get into the race because “America is in peril” and he wants to end Democratic control of Washington. Barnes initially had significant primary challengers, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who spent more than $11 million of his own money airing ads throughout the state. But over the span of a week last month, Barnes’ three top primary opponents – Lasry, Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson – all dropped out of the race and endorsed the lieutenant governor, effectively ending the primary. “I could not have imagined it ending up this way,” Barnes told CNN. “To me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the democratic majority is.” As the two candidates turn their focus on each other, Wisconsin represents yet another example of a high stakes Senate race where the contrast between candidates is significant, including Republican Herschel Walker vs. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Republican Mehmet Oz against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Republican Blake Masters vs. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona.  ‘The most vulnerable Republican incumbent’  The Barnes strategy is to define Johnson as a changed man, someone who went to Washington as an insurgent candidate but then enmeshed himself into the Republican Party led by former President Donald Trump. The attacks will include Johnson’s own admission that the 2017 tax bill passed by Republicans in Washington benefited his own company; his reported role in attempting to push a slate of fake electors after the 2020 election; and his more recent suggestion that Social Security and Medicare, two popular social spending programs, be changed from mandatory to discretionary spending, something experts argue could effectively end the programs. “What we ought to be doing is we ought to turn everything into discretionary spending so that it’s all evaluated so that we can fix problems or fix programs that are broken that are going to be going bankrupt,” Johnson said earlier this month. Barnes wasted no time jumping on the comment, using it to argue that Johnson’s personal wealth makes it impossible for him to understand what these programs mean to working class people. “If he wants be anti-Social Security, that’s on him,” Barnes told CNN, using the Johnson comment to inoculate himself from Republican charges of being too extreme. “That’s much more extreme than wanting working families and people all across Wisconsin have a fair shot.” With the primary all but decided, Barnes put out an attack ad earlier this month that hit Johnson on outsourcing jobs, using the senator’s defense of a company that took jobs out of Wisconsin. “Ron Johnson couldn’t be more out of touch with Wisconsin,” the ad says. Democrats are also preparing to paint Johnson as a candidate who has become a conspiracy theory promoter, including questioning the push to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, calling climate change “bullsh*t,” and suggesting – without any evidence – that the FBI had more inside knowledge than it let on about the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. Republican operatives working on Senate campaigns acknowledged the impact some of Johnson’s comments have had on his image. A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 46% of Wisconsin voters viewed him unfavorably, compared to 37% who had a favorable view. But one operative argued that some positive Johnson messaging over the summer, including significant spending by an outside group focused on inflation and a Johnson campaign ad focus on legislation that allowed for more experimental drug treatments, have done some rehabilitation. “His numbers are moving in the right direction,” the operative said, adding that, no matter what, “it is going to be a close race.” Democrats see negative views of Johnson as central to their plan of turning the general election into a referendum of the senator. “Ron Johnson is, without a doubt, the most vulnerable Republican incumbent on the map,” said Amanda Sherman Baity, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ‘Defined by all these left-wing positions’ The attacks on Barnes center on accusations that he is too extreme for the state, using his time as a community organizer, a state assemblyman from a solidly Democratic district and a “longtime leader” in the Working Families Party against him as he runs for Senate. The hits include his ties to members of the “Squad,” a group of liberal lawmakers in Congress who are often attacked by Republicans; a photo taken of him holding up an “Abolish ICE” T-shirt; and positions like ending cash bail, supporting the Green New Deal and a host of other views the Johnson campaign believes are too “extreme” for Wisconsin voters. Barnes has said he does not support abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but supports “addressing the concerns and issues and challenges that people have so that we can have a fair, comprehensive immigration reform system.” “All of these things are positions that might get you applause at a Working Families Party rally or get you the endorsement of AOC or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but when you look across the state, that is not where 50+1 of the state sits,” Voelkel said. One issue that Barnes’ campaign must confront is the fact that polls show that many Wisconsin voters don’t know enough about him to have an opinion – something that can be both helpful and hurtful. “Barnes is not nearly as known in the state as Johnson,” said Charles Franklin, pollster for the Marquette Law School poll, citing a recent poll that found over 50% of Democratic primary voters didn’t know enough about the lieutenant governor to form an opinion. “That is an opportunity for the Johnson side … to really try to step in and define Barnes.” And they plan to do just that, with the Johnson campaign and outside groups already gearing up to cast Barnes as out of step with most Wisconsin voters. “He is going to be defined by all these left-wing positions that he took in the past,” said Jack Pandol, spokesman for Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC focused on Senate races. “There is a lot that voters are going to be made aware of in the coming months and that will be the first information that some voters are getting about Barnes.” Barnes responded to these attacks by saying Republicans “tried to say the same thing about Tammy Baldwin,” and she went on to win the state’s other Senate seat in 2012 and reelection in 2018. “People like Ron Johnson are going to lie about whatever, anything he can think of, to take the heat off his own bad behavior,” he said. ‘We were polarized before it was cool’ The question among experts in Wisconsin is whether, after years of polarization and remarkably tight elections, there are even enough persuadable voters in the state to make the general election anything more than a base-focused race. Wisconsin has been a swing state for years. When Trump won it in 2016, he was the first Republican to win it since 1984. While Biden won the state back in 2020, the state has long had years of Republican governors, including Scott Walker from 2011 to 2019, and Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. “We were polarized before it was cool,” said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic operative in Wisconsin, arguing that the fights around union rights in 2011 and 2012 led to the state being deeply polarized long before the arrival of Donald Trump. “So that shrinking segment of swing voters is kind of the ball game. Yes, the political environment may be bad, but Republicans’ brand is rotten with those voters.” This is why political watchers like Franklin and others expect a deluge of negative ads in the contest, with both sides running campaigns that “reflect that polarization that we have had for a good 12 years.” Democrats are confident that if they can turn the race into a referendum on Johnson, there are enough votes who have backed him in the past who are ready for an alternative. “There is absolutely a world of ticket splitters, a world of persuadable voters and a world of people who might or might turn out,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.  Democrats do, however, face a difficult national environment, with President Joe Biden’s poll numbers slumping and voters across the country skeptical of Democratic leadership in Washington. With this in mind, Barnes argued it would be Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers – not the president – who would have the most direct impact on the contest. Evers himself is up for reelection. While he did not have a primary challenge, he will likely face a tough race against whoever emerges from what has been a tight Republican primary race on Tuesday. “This is a very Wisconsin focused race,” he said, citing a recent poll that found 48% of Wisconsin voters approved of Evers. “I would say that people know the work that we’ve been doing here in state and this race isn’t going to be determined about what people think about national politics.”",John Fetterman;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;Mehmet Oz;Tom Nelson;Ben Voelkel;Scott Walker;Elizabeth Warren;Alex Lasry;Joe Biden;Charles Franklin;Ben Wikler;Raphael Warnock;Tammy Baldwin;Herschel Walker;Joe Zepecki;Jack Pandol;Tony Evers;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Ron Johnson;Amanda Sherman Baity;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Mandela Barnes;Sarah Godlewski;Mark Kelly,Senate Leadership Fund;Republican Party;Democratic Party Of Wisconsin;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Marquette Law School;Marquette Law School;Families Party;Families Party;Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee;Wisconsin Senate,"TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,904;TAX_FNCACT_ADVISER,1021;EDUCATION,5414;EDUCATION,7699;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,93;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,1263;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9651;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,9747;TAX_FNCACT_REPRESENTATIVE,394;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,25;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3032;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3108;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3179;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3269;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,3457;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,4516;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,5273;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,6127;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,8239;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9119;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9220;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,9689;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_REPUBLICAN,10821;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,25;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3032;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3108;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3179;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3269;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,3457;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4516;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,5273;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,6127;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,8239;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9119;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9220;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,9689;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,10821;LEADER,2611;LEADER,7820;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_DEMOCRAT,1335;TAX_FNCACT_MANUFACTURER,704;ELECTION,339;ELECTION,1808;ELECTION,5453;ELECTION,6898;ELECTION,7492;ELECTION,7772;ELECTION,8080;ELECTION,8301;ELECTION,8406;ELECTION,8947;ELECTION,9605;ELECTION,9723;ELECTION,10182;ELECTION,10416;ELECTION,10953;",Pennsylvania;Outagamie County;Wisconsin;Arizona;America;Georgia;Washington;Milwaukee,2247

View more opinion on CNN. In homes swaddled in velvet curtains and where even the lavatories may be carpeted, where showers can be a challenge to centuries-old pipes, and iced tea is a contradiction in terms – hot is really horrid.    Welcome to Britain, where this week urban fires spontaneously erupted, the Queen’s guards melted under bearskins, trains ground to a halt and Members of Parliament – grudgingly – removed their jackets. As the United Kingdom officially experienced its hottest day ever at 40.3C (104.5F), large swathes of the country fried in the heat, and a population accustomed to such adjectives as “mild,” “tepid” and “clement” to describe its weather suffered a blast from the scorching blowtorch that is global warming. After millennia bemoaning leaden skies and constant drizzle, Britons took to complaining about the heat with aplomb; actually coping with Saharan-like temperatures came less naturally. The difficulty adjusting is perhaps forgivable. Shakespeare’s “other Eden” was always a temperate place, of gentle summers, where the biggest concern was that a passing shower might delay the village cricket match, not that the umpire could expire of sunstroke.  Frankly, we couldn’t cope. We were – literally – un-cool. As Aussies tweeted “helpful” tips for surviving the heatwave, hospitals canceled operations, teachers cut classes and planes were grounded as the runway melted. As for public transport: no chance.  South Yorkshire’s Barnsley – sodden, dank Barnsley, for heaven’s sake, a place with many charms but hardly the Riviera, was hotter than Beirut – by 20 degrees. It was all terribly un-British. Sure, there had been forest fires in France all week, and Australia and California seem to spend half the year ablaze these days – but Wennington in east London (where a sudden inferno consumed a row of terraced houses)? That’s freaky stuff. A kind of madness took over. As the Met Office’s first ever Red warning was issued, countless men fired up their barbeques as if they wanted to self-immolate while scorching meat. Milk-white bodies unused to the sunshine glare roasted to a deep hue of lobster. We ate ice lollies and complained and sweated and sat in kids’ paddling pools and complained and rescued dogs trapped in hot cars and complained and crowded on to beaches and into parks and complained, and it was just a lot and it was very, very hot.  Along with many others, my company issued a stern shelter-at-home edict (so nostalgic, so Covid-19 Christmas 2020) until it became clear working from home in fact constituted a cruel and unusual punishment under the UN Charter of Human Rights. Victorian terraces and 1960s tower blocks were never meant for heat like this. Sans air conditioning, upper floor bedrooms became uninhabitable and sleep impossible; by night, we sweated dreamlessly, fantasizing about the shutters and terracotta of Spain; the stone floors of the south of France. Several of my co-workers made a dash for it to the office, like soldiers crossing no man’s land, gambling that 30 minutes of the red fires of hell that was the Jubilee Line were worth enduring to make it to the oasis of air-conditioning in our unusually modern offices in the landmark Shard skyscraper. Meanwhile my family and I packed our bags and headed to the coast – a balmy 96F – where traffic jams snaked back to the motorway and the ice cream trucks ran out of the sweet stuff by 10am.  Back in Westminster, where I usually ply my trade, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, bent so far as to tell gentlemen MPs they could remove their jackets for the remainder of the week, although a dim view would be taken of those who eschewed ties. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace spoke for many when he confessed to finding the relaxation in the dress code somewhat discombobulating. What next, he mused, flip flops in the hallowed chamber? Outside in the corridors of power, the remaining candidates in the Conservative Party leadership contest to replace Boris Johnson as Prime Minister continued to woo their peers, perspiring their way through a never-ending series of hustings and debates. Critics have flagged the lack of mention of the planet in the contest. Like Meryl Streep’s president in the satire “Don’t Look Up,” the contenders seem content to blithely discuss the future of Britain in terms of taxes and woke wars, even as the asteroid of climate change barrels towards them.  By Tuesday night, the skies above London had opened; the worst of the heat wave was over, for now. But we won’t be putting the barbeque away; it’s due to be 85F on Sunday.",Theresa May;Meryl Streep;Lindsay Hoyle;Ben Wallace,Twitter;Facebook;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Members Of Parliament,"TAX_FNCACT_CANDIDATES,4646;TAX_FNCACT_ASSISTANT,72;LEADER,177;LEADER,4734;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,177;TAX_FNCACT_PRIME_MINISTER,4734;MILITARY,3616;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_SOLDIERS,3616;TAX_FNCACT_SOLDIERS,3616;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,640;PUBLIC_TRANSPORT,640;TAX_FOODSTAPLES_MEAT,2584;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEAT_WAVE,5334;TAX_WORLDCRUSTACEANS_LOBSTER,2666;TAX_DISEASE_GAMBLING,3648;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,3104;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,2680;NATURAL_DISASTER_ICE,3975;TAX_FNCACT_PEERS,4763;TAX_DISEASE_SUNSTROKE,1463;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,962;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHOR,121;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,4067;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,2387;NATURAL_DISASTER_FOREST_FIRES,2178;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,4204;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,4939;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,4672;NATURAL_DISASTER_HEATWAVE,1807;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,848;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1120;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,3311;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,5329;TRAFFIC,3932;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2172;WB_1777_FORESTS,2172;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2172;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2172;AFFECT,2762;SOC_SELFIMMOLATION,2563;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,82;DELAY,1389;USPEC_UNCERTAINTY1,1389;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,3235;EDUCATION,1850;KILL,2604;TAX_FNCACT_QUEEN,601;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,21;TAX_FNCACT_EDITOR,89;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,11;TAX_FNCACT_PRINCE,516;WB_135_TRANSPORT,1931;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,177;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,4734;USPEC_POLICY1,5056;EPU_CATS_TAXES,5056;URBAN,561;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DOGS,2767;ARMEDCONFLICT,5068;WB_2433_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,5068;WB_2462_POLITICAL_VIOLENCE_AND_WAR,5068;MEDICAL,1819;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITALS,1819;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_CONSERVATIVE_PARTY,4672;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,3242;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,3242;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,3242;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,3242;WB_698_TRADE,4186;MEDIA_SOCIAL,5223;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,681;EPU_CATS_MIGRATION_FEAR_FEAR,1351;TAX_FNCACT_UMPIRE,1437;WB_137_WATER,4051;MEDIA_MSM,43;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,1014;WB_567_CLIMATE_CHANGE,1014;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,1014;TAX_FNCACT_GENTLEMEN,4257;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,3632;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,4032;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,962;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,4408;",London;Britain;Britons;Australia;Wennington;France;California;United Kingdom;British;Aussies;Beirut;Spain,1066
459,https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/fashion/best-leggings-on-amazon,"If there was ever a perfect place to find leggings, it’s on Amazon. With every plausible categorization, from breathable nonslip to compression pocketed, there’s something for everyone. But a quick Amazon search for leggings yields over 40,000 product results, which can be pretty overwhelming. Luckily, we spoke with personal trainers, athleticwear designers and fitness instructors to get the scoop on what you should look for to find the best quality leggings on Amazon. Experts agree that the type of activity you’re doing matters. For example, when sprinting or boxing, USA Boxing coach and FightCamp trainer Jess Evans recommends a thicker, form-fitting waistband. “A thin waistband squeezes your waist instead of supporting it. I prefer a snug waistband for running or jumping,” she says. For Jordan Robbins, founder and CEO of Revly Sport, material is key. “Whether I am wearing leggings to a HIIT class or running errands, I don’t want to worry about them ripping,” she says. She recommends a compressing nylon-spandex blend. On the other hand, distance runners should prioritize finding lightweight leggings with sweat-wicking material. With comfort, functionality, material, style and price in mind, here’s what these fitness experts recommend.",Jess Evans,United States,,United States,254
160,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/politics/sinema-drought-tax-and-climate-bill/,"As Democrats scramble to clinch a deal on their tax and climate package, a last-minute demand is coming from key vote Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona: $5 billion to help the Southwest deal with its multi-year drought. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, confirmed to CNN that Sinema is seeking $5 billion worth of drought resilience funding. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said he’s “aware of the request.”   “I’m looking forward to details, I do welcome the additional resources for drought resilience,” Padilla told CNN.  Sinema is not the only lawmaker asking leadership to add drought funding, a source familiar with the negotiations told CNN. A coalition of several Western lawmakers who represent states in the Colorado River basin are in talks with Democratic leadership, and staff-level conversations are centered around seeking funding for programs that would be managed by the US Bureau of Reclamation – the federal agency that oversees the Colorado River.  The focus, the source said, would be to blunt the impact of the drought on farmers and cities in the West. A senior Democratic source told CNN they believe Democratic leaders will accommodate Sinema’s concerns, as well as her request to drop a $14 billion carried interest tax provision from the bill. Sinema’s office did not respond to CNN’s questions about the drought request.  Padilla and other senators from Western states told CNN that the years-long drought is a paramount concern.   Around 90% of Arizona was in some level of drought this week, according to the US Drought Monitor. And exceptional drought, the monitor’s most dire category, has also spread across parts of California, Nevada and Utah.   The senators’ drought request also comes as the US Bureau of Reclamation prepares its August report on the future of Lake Mead — which has continued its precipitous decline this year — and the Colorado River. CNN has reported that more water cuts are likely for the Southwest, given recent projections.  The drought, which scientists reported in February is the region’s worst in 12 centuries, has had sprawling consequences beyond water shortages, including extraordinarily dry vegetation, which has fueled intense and fast-moving wildfires.  “Things are terrible with drought in Colorado and the Colorado River Basin,” Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told CNN. “There’s half the water in the Colorado River that we need. This is a profoundly difficult time for the people that I represent.”  Bennet said he “cannot vote for a bill unless it improves the condition of the Colorado River in Colorado and in the upper basin,” and called for lawmakers to focus on long-term and lasting fixes, though he didn’t say exactly what was needed.   “I hope we can get to a solution, but it’s going to have to be a real solution – not these short-term temporary solutions that have spent lots of money but not seen any result from the point of view of the river basin,” Bennet said.  Padilla, who represents California, said drought conditions are “very bad” there. “There’s a sustained drought, it’s very concerning both from a water supply standpoint and of course wildfires,” Padilla said. “Drought, extreme heat, and windy conditions; it’s a dangerous recipe.”  Funding for drought resilience was also written into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Biden signed in November and Sinema played a key role in crafting. The bipartisan bill included $8.3 billion for water infrastructure programs and $1.4 billion for ecosystem restoration and resilience.

276,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/health/california-newsom-state-of-emergency-monkeypox/,"The governors of California and Illinois declared states of emergency to bolster their monkeypox vaccination efforts as the virus spreads nationwide. Monday’s declarations come as more than 5,800 probable or confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported in the US. California had more than 800 cases Tuesday, while Illinois had more than 500, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the World Health Organization has declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the Biden administration has not issued a nationwide public health emergency declaration. California is the third and largest state to issue a statewide declaration related to the disease. New York was the first to do so. California’s move allows emergency medical services personnel throughout the state to administer FDA-approved monkeypox vaccines, expanding the pool of people able to inoculate residents against the virus even as a vaccine shortage persists. “Expanding the pool of eligible vaccinators will substantially aid current efforts and support anticipated further vaccination efforts upon receipt of additional doses from the federal government,” the proclamation said. “California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release.  Illinois’ declaration also will make more resources available to combat the virus, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. The Chicago and state public health departments announced Illinois’ first presumptive case June 2.  “I am declaring a state of emergency to expand the resources and coordination efforts of state agencies in responding to, treating, and preventing the spread of MPV,” Pritzker tweeted. “In Illinois, we will ensure our LGBTQ+ community has the resources they need to stay safe while ensuring members are not stigmatized as they access critical health care.” Monkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox, that usually causes pimple- or blister-like lesions, as well as flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, muscle aches, chills and respiratory symptoms, according to the CDC. The virus can spread to anyone through close, often skin-to-skin contact, according to the CDC. It’s also possible for people to get monkeypox from infected animals. California has received more than 61,000 vaccine doses so far and distributed more than 25,000, according to the governor’s news release. Los Angeles County has received its own vaccine allocation, and state officials said California will make additional allocations in the coming weeks.  Last week, San Francisco became the first major US city to declare a local health emergency on monkeypox. “We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” the California governor said. California has been using testing, contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure built for the Covid-19 pandemic to respond to monkeypox outbreaks, Newsom’s office said. The CDC has made the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease, but access is limited in California. Now, the treatment can be administered at more than 30 facilities and providers across the state, officials said. California has also expanded its monkeypox testing capacity and can process more than 1,000 tests a week, according to Newsom. The state’s first case of monkeypox was reported May 21 and involved someone who had traveled abroad. Now, there are probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 27 different local health jurisdictions, including a case involving a toddler. In mid-July, California’s health department requested 600,000 to 800,000 additional monkeypox vaccine doses to help expand eligibility to both confirmed and probable exposures, as well as to high-risk individuals.  The health department is “hopeful the federal government will deliver additional vaccine to meet the state’s request,” it said in a news release Friday. As of last week, the US Department of Health and Human Services had delivered more than 336,000 doses of Jynneos – an FDA-approved vaccine created for smallpox and monkeypox – from the strategic national stockpile. Health authorities throughout the country have been focused on education efforts to inform Americans about how monkeypox spreads.  Monkeypox, according to the CDC, can spread via “respiratory secretions” and by touching objects contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. Many of the cases in the latest outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, but monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted disease.  A large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts on this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact. “Our team is also committed to reducing stigma among the LGBTQ community, which has been singled out and treated unfairly because of this outbreak. No single individual or community is to blame for the spread of any virus. Monkeypox can affect anyone as it spreads by skin-to-skin contact, as well as from sharing items like clothing, bedding and towels,” California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said in a Friday statement. Following the emergency declaration in California, Equality California, a major LGBT rights nonprofit organization, applauded the governor’s move, noting in a statement that the virus “continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual and queer men here in California and across the country.” Earlier Monday, state Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco, and members of the LGBTQ caucus called on Newsom to issue $38.5 million in an emergency budget appropriation to support local monkeypox response.

385,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/tech/tesla-stock-split/,"Tesla officially announced a three-for-one stock split, meaning the company’s stock price — which has jockeyed between $600 and $1,000 for a year — is about to get more affordable for investors. The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th. Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) shareholders approved the split Thursday at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting. Following the split, a person who owned one share of the company will hold three, and the price of each of those shares will be one-third of the price at that time. At Friday’s closing price of roughly $865, that would make the post-split price per share just about $288.  Stock splits are usually done to increase a stock’s liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the shares. Essentially, the move will triple the number of Tesla shares on the market, but the company’s overall valuation — and the value of each investor’s holding — won’t change. Splits can also boost demand for a stock because it puts the price within the reach of smaller, individual investors. Tesla’s made such a move before, as recently as 2020. Although deep-pocketed institutional investors don’t care as much about the company’s overall stock price, individual investors might be turned off by high-priced shares. The growth of zero-fee trading apps, including Robinhood, E-Trade and others, have made stock splits much more important in recent years. When Tesla announced its intention to pursue a stock split earlier this year, it said in a regulatory filing it believes “the stock split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity, all of which, in our view, may help maximize stockholder value.”  CNN’s David Goldman contributed to this report",David Goldman,Cnn;Cnn,"ECON_STOCKMARKET,67;ECON_STOCKMARKET,101;ECON_STOCKMARKET,234;ECON_STOCKMARKET,649;ECON_STOCKMARKET,693;ECON_STOCKMARKET,979;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1220;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1383;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1482;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1561;ECON_STOCKMARKET,1621;EPU_POLICY_REGULATORY,1532;WB_698_TRADE,253;WB_698_TRADE,1319;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,21;TAX_FNCACT_INVESTOR,909;TAX_ECON_PRICE,107;TAX_ECON_PRICE,471;TAX_ECON_PRICE,524;TAX_ECON_PRICE,562;TAX_ECON_PRICE,615;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1005;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1226;TAX_ECON_PRICE,1601;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1410;TAX_FNCACT_EMPLOYEES,1643;",New York,376
413,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/health/monkeypox-vaccine-health-wen-wellness/,"Monkeypox is spreading in the United States and around the world. There are at least 26,000 infections documented in over 80 countries. The World Health Organization has declared it a public health emergency of international concern. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting more than 6,600 infections, just two months after monkeypox was first detected in this outbreak, and on Thursday, the Biden administration officially declared monkeypox to be a public health emergency in the United States.   How much should people worry about contracting monkeypox? Should everyone be trying to get the vaccine? Who are the groups most at risk, and what actions should they take? How exactly is monkeypox spread and how can people prevent from trying to get it? What are common symptoms to look out for? To help us better understand monkeypox and the risk it poses, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.” CNN: How is monkeypox spread? Is it as transmissible as Covid-19, another disease that we know very well by now? Dr. Leana Wen: Monkeypox is not spread like Covid-19. As we know by now, Covid-19 is highly transmissible and can be spread through microscopic aerosols. That means you could be infected by someone who you’re having a casual conversation with or even someone who happens to be in the same conference room or restaurant as you. Monkeypox is primarily spread through prolonged, direct, skin-to-skin contact. Most cases thus far have been linked to sexual activity though this is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Rather, individuals can spread monkeypox through intimate contact, such as kissing, hugging, cuddling and sexual intercourse.    Individuals who have lesions can also shed virus onto bedsheets, towels and other linens that can spread the virus to others. This is why people with active monkeypox lesions are instructed not to share potentially contaminated items like linens, towels, drinking glasses and eating utensils with others. CNN: What kinds of symptoms do patients with monkeypox have? Wen: People who contract monkeypox often first start developing fever, headache, muscles aches and overall fatigue — similar to many other viral illnesses. Many people also have lymph node swelling. They then develop a rash that progresses into blisters, pimples or sores. The lesions can be all over the body or only in one part. It could be localized to just the anal or genital area, on the face, inside the mouth, or any other part of the body.  A large study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 528 infections across 43 sites in 16 countries. It found that the most common symptoms are fever, tiredness, muscle aches and lymph node swelling. Nearly all had a rash with blisters, though some individuals only had one lesion while others had several or more. Some people only had sores inside their mouth or in their anal or genital areas. Clinicians seeing patients with a fever and new rash should have a low threshold for testing for monkeypox, especially if the patient is in a high-risk group for contracting monkeypox. Importantly, the recent study also found that 29% of people diagnosed with monkeypox had a sexually transmitted infection. To me, this means that just because a patient is diagnosed with one thing doesn’t mean they can’t have another, too, and patients in high-risk groups who have new lesions need to get tested to rule out monkeypox. CNN: What started monkeypox, and how widespread is it in the United States? Wen: Monkeypox is a virus that is in the same family as the smallpox virus. It was first discovered in 1958 in monkeys, hence the name, though its usual animal hosts are rodents and other small mammals. It first appeared in humans in 1970 in East Africa. It has been endemic in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks sometimes occurring when infected travelers bring back the disease to their home countries. There was a big outbreak in the United States in 2003 due to imported rodents. This outbreak is much larger. More than 6,600 people have been infected in the United States thus far, with infections seen in almost every state. The CDC has an updated map of cases and infections here.  CNN: Who are the individuals in the high-risk groups for contracting monkeypox? Wen: Thus far, monkeypox has predominantly affected gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. In the New England Journal of Medicine international case series, 98% of people with monkeypox were gay or bisexual, and the transmission was linked to sexual activity in 95% of the cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the “vast majority” of cases in the United States are in men who have sex with men, with a median age of 36.  Currently individuals at high risk are men who have sex with men and who have sex with multiple or anonymous partners. There are also reports in the United States of some women and two children who have contracted monkeypox, who are all believed to be direct contacts of men who have sex with men. CNN: Has anyone died from monkeypox? Wen: Monkeypox usually has a fatality rate of 3% to 6%, according to the World Health Organization. Thankfully, no one has died from monkeypox in the United States yet, but this is a painful disease that can and does lead to severe illness and death. Those particularly vulnerable include pregnant women, young children and immunocompromised people. CNN: How much should people worry about monkeypox? Wen: Because of the way that monkeypox is spread, it is not yet a concern for most Americans. However, individuals who are gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, who have intimate contact with multiple or anonymous people, are at high risk.   These individuals should immediately seek testing if they have a new rash or sore, and they should avoid close physical contact in the meantime. People who wish to reduce their risk should avoid crowded clubs, raves, sex parties and other places where there is prolonged skin-to-skin or face-to-face contact with many people who may be wearing less clothing. CNN: Should everyone try to get the monkeypox vaccine? Wen: No. First of all, the monkeypox vaccine is extremely limited right now. About 600,000 doses of the two-dose vaccine have been delivered thus far, much less than the 1.5 million to 1.6 million people the CDC says are eligible. Those who should definitely get the vaccine are those with known exposure to someone with monkeypox. If given within four days of exposure, the vaccine can prevent someone from developing monkeypox. If given within two weeks, it lessens the likelihood of progression to severe illness. Soon, I hope there will be enough vaccine so that people in high-risk groups are able to access it. But given the way that monkeypox is spread, most Americans are not likely to contract it, and a mass vaccination campaign targeting the general population is probably not going to be recommended any time soon. CNN: Is monkeypox going to be yet another virus that will be endemic in the United States?  Wen: I really hope not. It is still possible to contain monkeypox through testing and vaccination. I hope that the WHO’s declaration of a global health emergency will spur more countries, including ours, to put every effort to try to prevent monkeypox from taking hold and becoming endemic here. And I think the Biden administration’s declaration will make a difference, too, to improve coordination and marshal needed resources.",Leana Wen;Leana Wen,Public Health;Public Health;Public

343,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/inflation-reduction-act-senate-reconciliation-bill/,"The latest Senate budget reconciliation deal is titled the Inflation Reduction Act, a nod to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who repeatedly refused to support the Democrats’ previous spending proposals because of inflation concerns. But economists disagree over whether the climate, health care and tax package would, in fact, live up to its name, particularly in the short term.  Some experts, including two economists influential among Democratic leaders, argue that the legislation would likely have a small effect on tamping down inflation or none at all. One independent analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model found that it might cause a slight uptick in inflation over the next few years but then reduce it later. Other economists, including 126 economists who sent a letter to congressional leadership Tuesday, are more bullish on the bill’s prospects to lower prices, though they did not qualify the extent. The letter writers include former Democratic administration officials and experts from left-leaning think tanks who argue that because the legislation would lower the deficit, it would put “downward pressure on inflation.” They urged Congress to pass the bill because of its “crucial investments in energy, health care and in shoring up the nation’s tax system.” It’s not unusual for economists to come to different conclusions, which can be influenced by partisan views on what data to evaluate and how much weight to give it.  Inflation surged to a new pandemic-era peak in June, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. US consumer prices jumped by 9.1% year over year, the highest level in more than 40 years. What’s in the bill Drastically scaled back from the Democrats’ initial spending proposals, the bill would allow Medicare to negotiate the cost of certain prescription medications, limit the price growth of certain drugs to inflation and cap what Medicare enrollees pay out of pocket for medications bought at the pharmacy.  It would also extend the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies through 2025 and provide $369 billion in tax credits and investments aimed at combating climate change, the biggest such effort in US history. And the legislation would create a new 15% minimum tax on the corporate profits that large companies report to shareholders, as well as close the carried interest loophole, which lets certain investment managers pay lower capital gains tax rates on a portion of their compensation. It would also give the Internal Revenue Service about $80 billion to increase enforcement. All told, the package would reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion over a decade, according to Senate Democrats. Argument for little inflation impact The act would “very slightly increase inflation” for the first few years and then reduce it a bit by the late 2020s, according to a preliminary analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, an independent research group that Manchin consults. The bill could initially add a little to inflation because extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies would put more money in the pockets of several million people, particularly lower- and moderate-income folks who would be more likely to spend it, said Kent Smetters, the group’s faculty director. The deficit reduction spurred by the drug price and tax measures, which kicks in during the latter part of the 10-year window, could then tamp down inflation. However, statistically, it has zero effect, the analysis found. “We don’t have a lot of confidence that this has any impact on inflation,” Smetters said. “It’s just simply not big enough, relative to the size of the rest of the economy.” Moody’s Analytics, whose work is often cited by the Biden administration, also found that the legislation is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on inflation.  It estimates the plan would lower the consumer price inflation index by 0.33% by the fourth quarter of 2031. That translates to a reduction in CPI inflation of 3.3 basis points per year on average.    “The impact on inflation is small,” Moody’s concludes.  Moody’s report found that the legislation would help ease inflation through extending Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and addressing climate change.  For instance, Moody’s estimates the energy provisions in the plan would reduce the typical American household’s spending on energy by an estimated $300 per year in 2018 dollars. Families would also be helped by lower insurance rates due to the reduction in emissions and physical risks, Moody’s said. Even though the legislation is much smaller in scale and scope than the original Build Back Better agenda, Moody’s concluded it will have a “material beneficial economic impact.”  “While modest legislation, there is plenty to like in the Inflation Reduction Act,” Moody’s economists led by Mark Zandi wrote in the analysis, obtained first by CNN.  Zandi was among the economists urging Congress to pass the legislation. Why the bill could reduce inflation Senate Democrats, however, contend that the bill would lower inflation. Manchin took issue with the Penn Wharton analysis, calling it “wrong” on CNN on Sunday. “How can it add flames to inflation fires right now if you’re paying down debt,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” The package counters inflation in three ways, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CNN’s John Berman. It reduces budget deficits, and therefore, the level of demand in the economy. Also, it cuts prices on prescription drugs, while increasing supply by stimulating energy production and subsidizing the transition to renewable energy.  “Less demand, more supply and direct, better bargaining for lower prices – those are the things that are involved in reducing inflation,” said Summers, who last year had warned that rising inflation was not transitory. “This bill is fighting inflation, and it’s got a whole set of collateral benefits, as well. It’s fair to call it the Inflation Reduction Act.” Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who was among the signers of the letter to congressional leaders, said a key driver of inflation is high energy costs, which the bill seeks to address through environmental investments.  “There is a simmering debate on the causes of inflation, but whatever side one takes in that debate, this bill is a step forward,” said Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University.

308,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/pelosi-taiwan-risks-greater-instability-us-china-analysis/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has already set off a fierce rhetorical response between the United States and China and sparked fears in Washington that Beijing will engineer an unprecedented escalation in the Taiwan Strait. Yet neither the United States nor China has any real interest in their budding superpower rivalry boiling over into open military clashes at this point, despite the soaring tensions caused by her arrival on Tuesday. And yet, the showdown is over the issue that is more likely than any other to spark a future US-China war. And Pelosi’s trip is almost certain to create greater instability in the relationship that would make future conflict more likely. Furious Chinese warnings that the California Democrat shouldn’t go and Washington’s vows not to be intimidated, meanwhile, show how inflamed political forces in each nation could make it almost impossible to manage the world’s most sensitive geopolitical duel. Pelosi and the congressional delegation that accompanied her said in a statement on Tuesday that the visit “honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.” The long-time critic of the Chinese communist government and its alleged human rights abuses arrived in Taipei despite extraordinary warnings from Beijing of reprisals and consequences. Ahead of Pelosi’s arrival, rhetoric was flying between Washington and Beijing. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NBC’s “Today” that China “should think very carefully” about escalating the situation and warned the US would do whatever was necessary to protect its interests.  But China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi renewed President Xi Jinping’s warning in a call to President Joe Biden last week that Washington should not “play with fire” on Taiwan and reiterated Beijing’s “One China” policy. Pelosi’s position and new conditions created by the nationalistic rule of Xi, as well as Beijing’s new assertiveness and military and strategic power, make this the most risky brinkmanship over Taiwan in decades.  Given that Pelosi is in Taipei, the question has now become how Beijing will respond. Most of its options – following a barrage of threats and propaganda that have raised expectations for its riposte – are quite alarming. Most analysts think that some kind of military show of force is likely, at a time when China has already been sending its jets into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone in unprecedented numbers. While China’s moves may not directly threaten US naval forces in the area, they could add to the potential for miscalculations – and also raise the prospect of how Taiwan would respond to serious provocations. Why would Pelosi go? So why did Pelosi go and would her trip needlessly antagonize China’s leadership?  Supporters of the visit, who unusually include many Republicans lined up behind Pelosi, say it’s critical for the speaker to show support for Taiwan and to underscore Washington is serious about its legal commitment to offer the island the means of its self-defense. Pelosi is also a symbol of democracy – a way of life that Taipei is desperate to preserve under China’s authoritarian shadow. But the controversy is not limited to Taiwan. This is about a broader context of China’s building challenge to America’s determination to preserve democracy, Western values and military and economic primacy in the Pacific and across the world.   Once news of Pelosi’s expected visit leaked, it became politically implausible – domestically and for strategic reasons – for her to bend to Beijing’s warnings that she should not go. It would be unpalatable for Pelosi, following a political career partly defined by standing up to China, to give up on her plan. And it would send a message that the United States, in one of its first standoffs with a newly confident superpower rival in the Pacific, would back down. Biden also had political considerations. While he publicly admitted that the US military was worried about the visit, he could not openly side with China over Pelosi. And a President can hardly order one of the top representatives of another branch of government what she should and should not do, even if officials worked to apprise the speaker of all the potential consequences of her decision. Politics are driving China’s actions too  Politics rage within the Chinese politburo, too, though many in the West often view China’s communist leadership as monolithic. Xi built his power base on aggressive nationalism and the idea that Taiwan’s destiny is “reunification” with the mainland. He is determined to preside over a national rejuvenation that will purge China’s past humiliation over colonialism and long 20th century isolation when it did not wield what he views as its rightful influence in the world. So Pelosi’s expected visit is more than a jab at China; it’s a personal slight to Xi’s core project by one of the most senior US politicians – and is one that demands a political response. The crisis also comes at a pivotal moment in Beijing. In a few months, Xi is poised to claim an unusual third term and he cannot afford to be seen as weak. And his government’s questionable handling of the Covid-19 pandemic – mass lockdowns are still common in Chinese cities – and a slowing economy, mean Xi could be tempted into a nationalistic stand to mask domestic liabilities. A long festering dispute While the current standoff is alarming, Taiwan has long been an irritant in US-China relations. The dispute is made even more confusing by complicated diplomatic agreements and nuanced US strategic doctrines designed to avoid the possibility of war with China. The island is viewed by Beijing as a rightful part of its territory. The United States recognizes the People’s Republic of China on the mainland as the sole legitimate government of China and doesn’t regard Taiwan as a country. But it doesn’t accept the Chinese Communist Party’s claim of sovereignty over the democratic island. While it offers Taiwan the means of self defense when it buys US made weapons, Washington has adopted a policy of purposeful vagueness over whether it would itself defend Taiwan, partly to deter a declaration of independence from Taipei and to give leaders in Beijing second thoughts about a forceful takeover of the island.  Robert Daly, a former US diplomat in Beijing, said Monday that China’s eventual response – perhaps, for example, an incursion into Taiwanese airspace, was unlikely to cause a war but would push the rivals closer to a danger zone.  “That will set up a new baseline that leads us slightly closer to confrontation,” Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “I don’t think that we will be at confrontation this time around, but I don’t think we will be better off in our relations with Beijing a week from now than we are today.” Why Biden worries about the trip Biden has reorganized US foreign policy around the principle of countering China’s growing might in Asia and further afield. Thirty years ago, Washington hoped that by encouraging then-reclusive China into the global economy it could promote political liberalization and usher it into the Western-oriented global economic and political system. But Beijing has sought to use its rising military and political power and influence to build an alternative political and economic value system to the one represented by the US and its allies.  But Biden also wants to manage this new competitive relationship so that it does not result in war between the rising power in the Pacific (China) and the existing one (the United States) and its allies.   The US leader stressed in a telephone call with Xi last week that there has been no change to the fundamental nature of US-China relations or the position of the White House when it comes to Taiwan. Yet seen from Beijing, Biden’s repeated recent statements that the US would defend Taiwan, which were all walked back by aides, may have left an impression that he is not sincere.  China is also watching a growing movement among hawks in Congress for Washington to replace the policy of “strategic ambiguity” over US intentions if China invades Taiwan for a clear statement that the US would defend the island.  Some analysts say such a shift could not only risk dragging the United States into a war in the Pacific against China that Americans are not prepared for, but that it could also make Beijing even more aggressive. Or that the promise of a US shield could embolden a push for independence in Taiwan that could also force China’s hand and bring a broader military conflict over the island closer. Ahead of Pelosi’s visit, official statements by administration officials firmly restated that there had been no change to US policy and affirmed her right to travel but hinted at the possibility of a rocky few weeks when China responds in whatever form. “There’s no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There’s no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,” the White House’s National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday. “We shouldn’t be, as a country, intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions.”  But in a new statement on Monday, Zhang Jun, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, warned again that China’s military would not “sit by idly” as Pelosi visits and that her trip would have an “egregious political impact.” The assumption in Washington is that Xi has no more interest in a direct military showdown than Biden does. But he’s stronger than previous Chinese leaders. And there is a strongly nationalist streak within the Chinese military along with growing confidence about its capacity.  So making assumptions about how China would respond to Pelosi’s visit based on its behavior in past crises that have blown over might mean the US is in for an unpleasant surprise.

661,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/trump-white-house-notes-toilet-photos-cnntv/,"Newly revealed photographs reveal two occasions on which former President Donald Trump apparently flushed documents down the toilet. Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter and CNN contributor, is publishing the new images in her forthcoming book, “Confidence Man,” and the images were earlier posted by Axios. CNN has previously reported how Trump flouted presidential record-keeping laws and would often tear up documents, drafts and memos after reading them. He periodically flushed papers down the toilet in the White House residence – only to be discovered later on when repairmen were summoned to fix the clogged toilets. Trump has denied the allegations, and in a statement given to Axios on Monday, a spokesman claimed that reporting about the practice was fabricated.  In the images revealed on Monday, it’s unclear what the documents are in reference to – and who authored them – but they appear to be written in Trump’s handwriting in black marker. Haberman said one image is from a White House toilet and the other one is from an overseas trip that was provided to her by a Trump White House source. “Who knows what this paper was? Only he would know and presumably whoever was dealing with it, but the important point is about the records,” Haberman told CNN’s John Berman and Brianna Keilar on “New Day” Monday morning.  Trump had a pattern of disregarding normal record preservation procedures. In one occasion, Trump asked if anyone wanted to put a copy of a speech he just delivered up for auction on eBay, during a mid-flight visit to the press cabin Air Force One. In other instances, Trump would task aides with carrying boxes of unread memos, articles and tweet drafts aboard the presidential aircraft for him to review and then tear to shreds. A former senior Trump administration official said a deputy from the Office of Staff Secretary would usually come in to pull things out of the trash and take them off Trump’s desk after he left a room. A former White House official recalled that while document preservation was a key responsibility of the staff secretary, the rest of Trump’s senior staffers lacked the sense of their obligation to maintain records of papers that moved through the West Wing. Trump’s haphazard record-keeping was the subject of a drawn-out fight earlier this year between him and the National Archives, and the Justice Department has been investigating the matter.",Maggie Haberman;Donald Trump;Donald Trump;John Berman,Office Of Staff;New York Times;White House;White House;White House;White House;Justice Department;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;National Archives,"TAX_FNCACT_DEPUTY,1961;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,2496;WB_840_JUSTICE,2496;SANITATION,159;SANITATION,537;SANITATION,923;SANITATION,1148;MEDIA_MSM,206;TAX_FNCACT_REPORTER,206;TAX_FNCACT_REPAIRMEN,612;TAX_FNCACT_SPOKESMAN,745;MILITARY,1714;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1354;LEADER,101;LEADER,852;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,101;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,852;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,101;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,852;LEGISLATION,419;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,556;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1141;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1235;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,2122;TAX_FNCACT_MAN,296;TAX_FNCACT_AIDES,1763;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,1947;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,2131;TAX_FNCACT_STAFFERS,2257;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,1089;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1996;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,2221;",White House;Washington;New York,468
130,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/03/politics/joe-biden-abortion-executive-order/,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order to help ensure access to abortion in light of the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer to eliminate the constitutional right to the procedure. The President said the order helps women travel out of state to receive abortions, ensures health care providers comply with federal law so women aren’t delayed in getting care and advances research and data collection “to evaluate the impact that this reproductive health crisis is having on maternal health and other health conditions and outcomes.” Biden spoke of the “chaos and uncertainty” that has ensued in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision and said, “Women’s health and lives are on the line.” “Emergency medical care being denied to women experiencing miscarriages, doctors uncertain about what they can do to provide for their patients, pharmacists unsure whether they can fill prescriptions that they’ve always filled before, a tragic case of rape survivors, including a 10-year-old girl forced to travel to another state for care,” Biden said before signing the order.  The order comes the day after Kansas voters handed abortion-rights advocates a massive victory and defeating a measure that would have allowed the GOP-led legislature to impose new restrictions. It was a vote that Biden celebrated at the White House. “In a decisive victory, voters made it clear that politicians should not interfere with the fundamental rights of women. And the voters of Kansas sent a powerful signal that this fall the American people will vote to preserve and protect the right and refuse to let them be ripped away by politicians,” Biden said at the event. “And my administration has their back.” Biden signed the executive order during the inaugural meeting of the administration’s recently established Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, which is comprised of representatives from multiple departments across the federal government. Cabinet members briefed the President on steps their respective agencies have taken to defend reproductive rights.  The order directs Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra to consider “all appropriate actions to ensure health care providers comply with federal non-discrimination laws so that women receive medically necessary care without delay,” including steps to provide health care providers with technical and legal guidance amid the patchwork of state legal restrictions on abortion care following the Supreme Court’s decision.  Last month, CNN reported doctors have struggled to navigate byzantine guidance as states across the country pass increasingly strict abortion restrictions, with experts warning of “an enormous chilling effect” on doctors performing miscarriage surgeries even when doctors “are confident that what they’re doing is within the letter of the law.” Wednesday’s order also directs HHS to consider actions guaranteeing women traveling across state lines seeking abortions have access to health care services, including through Medicaid. Last month, a bill guaranteeing women the right to travel across state lines to seek abortions failed to pass the Senate after Republicans blocked the measure. According to a senior administration official, that would allow states to provide care for out-of-state patients seeking abortions through a Medicaid 1115 waiver, permitting states to waive certain state-based requirements in providing care and assist in covering “certain costs.”  The executive order further directs HHS to expand research efforts on maternal health data, “to accurately measure the impact that diminishing access to reproductive health care services has on women’s health,” the official said Tuesday. Pressed Wednesday on how the president’s executive order on reproductive care avoids running afoul of the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to perform abortions, White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said the Department of Health and Human Services will “come up with the details on the specifics on how they’re gonna work with states” to provide care via Medicaid waivers. “So, as you know, Medicaid provides comprehensive health care to women with low incomes – this care includes family planning services such as contraception, non-emergency medical, transportation, and support services like targeted case management, which allows health care providers to help patients coordinate their care,” Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee. “And it also includes abortion care in certain circumstances, as accepted by the Hyde Amendment, which is rape, incest and life of the mother.” The executive order, Jean-Pierre told Lee, “will cover care that is otherwise part of Medicaid,” including non-emergency medical travel and other health care services. She added, “The Hyde Amendment is law and we’re gonna, we’re gonna follow that law.” Wednesday’s executive order is the second one signed by Biden in the wake of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Last month, Biden signed an order that he said would safeguard access to abortion care and contraceptives, protect patient privacy and establish an interagency task force to use “every federal tool available to protect access to reproductive health care.” Ultimately, however, there is no action the President can take to restore the nationwide right to an abortion, and Biden has publicly acknowledged that his options to expand abortion access remain limited.

663,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/biden-china-taiwan-drills/,"President Joe Biden said Monday he was concerned about China’s recent military exercises around Taiwan but that he didn’t believe China would take additional action as it escalates tensions following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit.  China has spent several days conducting military drills that have essentially encircled Taiwan and restricted access to civilian ships and aircraft in the area. The extensive exercises mark a significant escalation by China after Pelosi’s trip to Taipei to show support for democracy on the island, which prompted outrage from Beijing. China views Taiwan as its territory despite never having controlled it.  “I’m not worried, but I’m concerned that they’re moving as much as they are. But I don’t think they’re going to do anything more,” Biden told reporters on Monday before departing for Kentucky.  Tensions continue to escalate in the region as China floods the seas and skies around Taiwan with ships and jets and conducts live-fire drills and missile launches. In addition to the drills, Beijing has canceled future phone calls between Chinese and US defense leaders, suspended bilateral climate talks and sanctioned Pelosi and her immediate family. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday Beijing’s military drills are “provocative, irresponsible and raise the risk of miscalculation.”  “We condemn these actions, we have, we’ve been condemning them since they started escalating and we’ve also said we anticipated China might take this step,” Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One.  The White House on Thursday summoned China’s ambassador to condemn the military activities and to stress the US’ wish to avoid a crisis in the region. National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said the US reiterated there had been no change to the US’ “One China” policy and that Washington recognizes the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China.  The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, and is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. But it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as “strategic ambiguity.” Pelosi’s trip came at a low point in US-China relations and in the face of warnings from the Biden administration against a visit to the democratically governed island. Pelosi has said her visit, which was the first time a US House speaker had visited Taiwan in 25 years, was intended to make it clear the US would “not abandon” Taipei.",Karine Jean-Pierre;John Kirby;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden,White House;White House;National Security Council;Cnn,"EPU_POLICY_GOVERNMENT,2187;MEDIA_MSM,997;MEDIA_MSM,1753;DELAY,1257;TAX_FNCACT_LEADERS,1319;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1939;TAX_FNCACT_PRESS_SECRETARY,1429;TAX_FNCACT_AMBASSADOR,1829;USPEC_POLICY1,2072;USPEC_POLICY1,2445;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,2072;EPU_POLICY_POLICY,2445;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,698;TAX_FNCACT_MINISTER,797;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,698;TAX_FNCACT_FOREIGN_MINISTER,797;WB_2470_PEACE_OPERATIONS_AND_CONFLICT_MANAGEMENT,1939;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1939;WB_2490_NATIONAL_PROTECTION_AND_SECURITY,1939;EPU_CATS_NATIONAL_SECURITY,1939;MILITARY,1770;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,290;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1181;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1227;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_DRILLS,1491;DEMOCRACY,520;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,520;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1906;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,212;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,2713;LEADER,14;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,14;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,14;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,1331;GENERAL_GOVERNMENT,2136;LEGISLATION,2276;EPU_POLICY_LAW,2276;TAX_FNCACT_COORDINATOR,1959;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1108;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1413;EPU_POLICY_WHITE_HOUSE,1791;NATURAL_DISASTER_FLOODS,1099;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,1298;TAX_ETHNICITY_CHINESE,2425;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,1298;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_CHINESE,2425;TAX_FNCACT_SECRETARY,1429;",White House;Taiwan;Republic Of China;Chinese;Washington;Kentucky;Beijing;Taipei;China,491

Pelosi is leading a Congressional delegation to the Indo-Pacific and plans to visit places including Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, according to a statement released by her office on Sunday. The statement made no mention of Taiwan, despite speculation in recent days that Pelosi might be planning to visit the self-governing democracy of 24 million people. China’s Communist Party, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory – despite never having controlled it – has warned against Pelosi visiting the island, and US President Joe Biden recently let slip that the US military thinks such a trip would be “not a good idea right now”. However, US lawmakers on both sides of Washington’s political divide have urged her to go. “Today, our Congressional delegation travels to the Indo-Pacific to reaffirm America’s strong and unshakeable commitment to our allies and friends in the region,” Pelosi said in the statement released by her office.  She said high level meetings will be held in each country to “further advance our shared interests and values, including peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance.” Pelosi said the delegation had received a briefing from United States Indo-Pacific Command leadership after a fuel stop in Hawaii, where they visited the Pearl Harbor Memorial and the USS Arizona. Traveling alongside Pelosi as part of the Congressional delegation are Chairman Gregory Meeks (Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee), Chairman Mark Takano (Chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs), Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Congressman Andy Kim. “Under the strong leadership of President Biden, America is firmly committed to smart, strategic engagement in the region, understanding that a free and flourishing Indo-Pacific is crucial to prosperity in our nation and around the globe,” Pelosi said.",Raja Krishnamoorthi;Gregory Meeks;Suzan Delbene;Andy Kim;Mark Takano;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Nancy Pelosi;Joe Biden,China Communist Party;House Committee On Veteran Affairs;House Foreign Affairs Committee,"TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2029;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSMAN,2065;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,227;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,968;USPEC_POLITICS_GENERAL1,1831;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,227;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,968;EPU_POLICY_CONGRESSIONAL,1831;EPU_POLICY_POLITICAL,911;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HUMAN,1529;TAX_FNCACT_LAWMAKERS,858;EPU_POLICY_LAWMAKERS,858;TAX_FNCACT_VETERAN,1977;EPU_ECONOMY,1461;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,1461;GENERAL_HEALTH,1500;HEALTH_PANDEMIC,1500;WB_635_PUBLIC_HEALTH,1500;WB_2165_HEALTH_EMERGENCIES,1500;WB_2166_HEALTH_EMERGENCY_PREPAREDNESS_AND_DISASTER_RESPONSE,1500;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,1500;WB_2167_PANDEMICS,1500;UNGP_HEALTHCARE,1500;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNIST,579;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1514;TAX_DISEASE_COVID_19,1491;TAX_FNCACT_CONGRESSWOMAN,2001;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1855;TAX_FNCACT_CHAIRMAN,1925;TAX_POLITICAL_PARTY_COMMUNIST_PARTY,585;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2203_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1536;WB_2432_FRAGILITY_CONFLICT_AND_VIOLENCE,1536;UNGP_CRIME_VIOLENCE,1536;DEMOCRACY,541;UNGP_POLITICAL_FREEDOMS,541;TAX_FNCACT_SPEAKER,30;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,1521;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1560;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1560;LEADER,730;LEADER,2118;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,730;TAX_FNCACT_PRESIDENT,2118;WB_471_ECONOMIC_GROWTH,1468;ENV_CLIMATECHANGE,1521;UNGP_CLIMATE_CHANGE_ACTION,1521;",Japan;Hawaii;Taiwan;Hong Kong;Singapore;United States;Arizona;America;Washington;Malaysia;South Korea;Pearl Harbor;China,402
372,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/02/media/alex-jones-sandy-hook-trial/,"The parents of a child who was murdered during the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting delivered emotional testimony in a Texas court on Tuesday, telling a jury that the lies pushed by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones have stained the legacy of their son and tormented them for years. The jury hearing the case will determine how much in damages Jones will have to pay the parents, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis, who won a default judgement against him earlier this year. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis asked the jury last week to award Heslin and Lewis $150 million.  Fighting back tears at times, Heslin told the jury that Jones, through his conspiratorial media organization Infowars, “tarnished the honor and legacy” of his son. Heslin said that he couldn’t “even begin to describe the last nine-and-a-half years of hell” he has endured because of Jones. “There’s got to be a strong deterrent that shall prevent him from peddling this propaganda,” Heslin said, adding that through his testimony he wanted “to restore my credibility, my reputation, and Jesse’s legacy that he so much deserves.” As Heslin testified, a television screen in the court showed a photograph of his murdered son, six-year-old Jesse Lewis. Jones, who is expected to testify in his own defense later on Tuesday, was absent from the courtroom during Heslin’s testimony and the first part of Lewis’ testimony. Heslin called that absence “a cowardly act.” “I’ve been here for a week and a half and [during] my final testimony Mr. Alex Jones does not have the courage to sit in front of me or face me,” Heslin said. An attorney representing Heslin and Lewis told CNN the two have needed to be in isolation and under the protection of professional security during the trial. Heslin also said on the stand that the lie pushed by Jones “resonates around the world” and that he has realized “how dangerous” it is. Heslin described being repeatedly confronted by those who believed Jones over the last ten years, saying such interactions occur “right up to this day.” “My life has been threatened,” Heslin said. “I fear for my life. I fear for my safety and my family’ safety and their life.” ‘Jesse was real. I’m a real mom’ In a remarkable moment in court, Lewis directly spoke to Jones, who was in the courtroom after the trial broke for lunch. She said that she wanted to address Jones to his face. “Jesse was real,” Lewis told Jones. “I’m a real mom.” Lewis told Jones that she thinks he didn’t actually believe the lies he pushed about Sandy Hook. “That’s the problem, I know you know that,” Lewis told Jones. “But you keep saying it. Why? Why? For money?” Lewis said that “having a six-year-old son shot in the forehead” while at school is an “unbearable pain.” “And then to have someone on top of that perpetuate a lie that it was a hoax, that it didn’t happen, that it was a false flag, and that I was an actress — You think I’m an actress?” Lewis asked. Lewis told the jury that monetary damages were appropriate in the case because she doesn’t believe Jones will ever stop. “There has not been a sincere apology,” she said. “But if there was, ever, I liken it to being in a car accident and you run over someone and cause tremendous bodily damage and you look at that person lying on the ground and say, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I’m not accountable for any of the damage I just caused. But I’m sorry.’ That’s how I see it.” Regardless, Lewis said that she does not believe Jones understands the repercussions “of going on air with a huge audience and lying and calling this a hoax.” “It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this,” Lewis told Jones. “That we have to implore you — not just implore you, punish you — to get you to stop lying…It is surreal what is going on in here.” Lewis also testified in court that she has been harassed and received death threats, including at her own home, all of which she said reopens the wounds surrounding her son’s murder. “The fear and anxiety and unsafeness … keeps me from healing,” Lewis said. “It definitely negatively impacts the healing process.” Lewis described the conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook as “deeply unsettling.” “I feel compromised,” Lewis said, describing how she feels about her own personal safety. Roy Lubit, a forensic psychiatrist who was hired to conduct an examination of Heslin and Lewis, testified to the court on Monday how terrified and worried for their personal safety the two parents are.  Lubit told the court that Lewis and Heslin “are very, very frightened.” When asked to specify who they are frightened of, Lubit responded, “Some follower of Jones trying to kill them.” Lubit elaborated that Lewis sleeps with a gun, a knife, and pepper spray on her night stand. Lubit added she won’t even turn on the air conditioning during hot days for fear of not being able to hear an intruder possibly coming to hurt her.  Lewis testified Tuesday that she owns a gun to keep her other son safe, telling the jury that she failed to keep one son safe and will do everything in her power to ensure that no harm happens to her other child. ‘This is not your show’ Jones took the stand in the afternoon, telling the court he felt “good” because he was being afforded the opportunity to push back against the plaintiffs and news media. From the stand, Jones told Heslin and Lewis, “I never intentionally tried to hurt you.” Jones said “the internet had a lot of questions” about the Sandy Hook shooting, and so did he. Jones argued he simply had “tried to find out what actually happened.” After the jury had left the courtroom following Jones’ testimony, Mark Bankston, the attorney for the plaintiffs, accused Jones and his attorney, Federico Andino Reynal, of trying to “poison” the trial. Bankston said that they would file a motion for sanctions against both Jones and Reynal. Bankston specifically said Jones broke court orders when he attempted to discuss his net worth from the stand. “Mr. Jones just intentionally did that in violation of your order to attempt to poison this compensatory damage verdict to try to tell this jury that he’s broke, and he’s not, and that’s in violation of your order,” Bankston said to the judge. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said she will hear any motions officially filed for sanctions against Jones and Reynal after the conclusion of the trial. But Gamble admonished Jones for his behavior and said he had already violated his oath to tell the truth twice. “Mr. Jones, you may not say to this jury that you complied with discovery. That is not true. You may not say it again. You may not tell this jury that you are bankrupt. That is also not true,” Gamble said. “You are already under oath to tell the truth,” Gamble added. “You’ve already violated that oath twice today, in just those two examples. It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify. Yet here I am again.” “This is not your show,” Gamble added. Jones attempted to tell Gamble that he believed he was telling the truth. “You believe everything you say is true, but your beliefs do not make something true,” Gamble said. “That is that is what we’re doing here. Just because you claim to think something is true does not make it true. It does not protect you. It is not allowed. You’re under oath. That means things must actually be true when you say them.” At the conclusion of court proceedings, Lewis walked over to Jones and handed him a bottle of water because he had complained about having trouble speaking due to a torn larynx. Jones started talking to Lewis and Heslin and the exchange with Heslin grew heated. An attorney for Heslin and Lewis interjected, telling Jones as he escorted his clients out of the courtroom, “That’s not even a thought. That’s not the way this goes.” Jones shouted back, “Why because you can’t feed them fake videos anymore?” Other legal developments Jones has lashed out at the judicial proceedings taking place, baselessly claiming last week that he was being tried in Texas before a “kangaroo court.” Infowars has also published content attacking the judges overseeing the cases in vicious terms. Jones’ media company, Free Speech Systems, which is the company that operates Infowars, filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday. Jury selection for a similar trial involving Jones and Sandy Hook families commenced on Tuesday in Connecticut, where Jones was also found liable for damages earlier this year. But jury selection was suspended after Jones’ attorneys filed documents in federal court to remove the case for now due to Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy filing. Attorneys representing some Sandy Hook families have accused Jones of having drained Free Speech Systems of assets in recent years as part of an effort to protect himself from potential judgements he may be ordered to pay. One of the attorneys, Avi Moshenberg, told CNN on Tuesday that the bankruptcy filing made by Free Speech Systems indicated that $62 million in assets had been withdrawn from the company in 2021 and 2022. “If you look at the bankruptcy filing, leading up to the declaration of bankruptcy, Alex Jones, the sole owner [of Free Speech Systems], took $62 million in draws in 2021 and 2022,” Moshenberg told CNN. “Just straight up draws. That’s why the company has few assets.” A lawyer representing Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday morning. But a hearing is scheduled on Wednesday in which W. Marc Schwartz, the chief restructuring officer for Free Speech Systems, is expected to testify.

458,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/06/us/minnesota-morning-after-pill-verdict/,"A jury in Aitkin County, Minnesota, on Friday found that a pharmacy did not discriminate against a woman by refusing to fill her emergency contraception prescription, court records show. However, the jury found the pharmacist did cause the woman emotional harm in the amount of $25,000. According to the original complaint, Andrea Anderson, a mother and a licensed foster parent, obtained a prescription in January 2019 for Ella – otherwise known as the “morning after pill” or emergency contraception – after her regular contraception failed. Her doctor sent the prescription to the McGregor Pharmacy, but the pharmacist on duty, George Badeaux, told Anderson that he would be unable to fill her prescription because of his “beliefs.” Badeaux “did not clarify what his beliefs were or why they interfered with his ability to perform his job as a medical professional,” according to the complaint.  Anderson eventually found a pharmacy that was willing to fill her prescription – after driving over 100 miles round trip in a snowstorm, the complaint stated. Badeaux’s attorney Charles Shreffler said in a statement he and his client were “incredibly happy with the jury’s decision.” “Medical professionals should be free to practice their profession in line with their beliefs,” the statement said. “Mr. Badeaux is unable to participate in any procedure that requires him to dispense drugs that have the potential to end innocent human life in the womb. Every American should have the freedom to operate according to their ethical and religious beliefs. Doctors, pharmacists, and other medical providers are no different.” CNN has reached out to attorneys for the pharmacy for comment. Gender Justice, the advocacy group representing Anderson, had argued that denying Anderson service based on her reproductive health care needs was illegal sex discrimination and violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act. The group said it would appeal the jury’s decision to the state’s Court of Appeals. “To be clear, the law in Minnesota prohibits sex discrimination and that includes refusing to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception,” Gender Justice Legal Director Jess Braverman said. “The jury was not deciding what the law is, they were deciding the facts of what happened here in this particular case. We will appeal this decision and won’t stop fighting until Minnesotans can get the health care they need without the interference of providers putting their own personal beliefs ahead of their legal and ethical obligations to their patients.” Since a major pharmaceutical business deal in 2017, the so-called morning after pill has become America’s most widely used over-the-counter emergency contraception. Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, there are fears that some types of birth control won’t be available, and demand for longer-lasting birth control and emergency contraception, including the morning-after pill, has grown. Correction: An earlier version of this story contained a photo of the headquarters of a pharmacy chain that is not affiliated with the defendant in the lawsuit. It has been removed. The story has also been updated to make clear the defendant pharmacy’s name and to whom CNN reached out for comment. The story also misspelled the name of the county where the pharmacy is located. It is in Aitkin County.

330,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/us/parkland-shooting-cruz-sentencing-trial/,"Jurors in the sentencing phase of the Parkland, Florida, school shooter’s trial on Thursday visited the scene of the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School’s 1200 building, which has been sealed since the attack on February 14, 2018.  They saw bloodstains where the victims were shot and killed, according to a group of reporters allowed to enter after jurors completed their walk-through. Valentine’s Day gifts and cards littered the scene, and bullet holes were in the walls. Fragments of broken safety glass lay everywhere, the reporters wrote, crunching beneath their feet.  The visit, Judge Elizabeth Scherer explained to jurors Wednesday, was meant to help them analyze the evidence presented so far in the trial of Nikolas Cruz, who faces either the death penalty or life in prison after pleading guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder.  The state rested its case Thursday afternoon, after jurors returned from the visit and prosecutors called several more witnesses to offer victim impact statements.  Pool footage taken from outside the building Thursday showed it remained fenced off, hidden in part behind banners that carried the high school’s name and the emblem of its eagle mascot. The judge, prosecutors and defense attorneys were also seen entering the building.        Jurors were instructed Wednesday to “avoid touching, manipulating or moving anything.” The judge also told them to explore the scene on their own and at their own pace, moving as a group from floor to floor. Cruz did not attend the visit, telling the judge Thursday morning in response to her questioning that it was his decision not to go.  “Nothing will be explained or pointed out to you,” the judge’s instructions said. Jurors were also told to avoid speaking to anyone until the viewing was complete. On the first floor, there was dried blood outside room 1215 where three students were killed, per the reporters who went inside. In room 1214, a Holocaust studies class, were two yellowed copies of the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. Bullet marks marred the desks, and laptops sat open. In room 1216, a blue folder with Alaina Petty’s name sat on a desk, the reporters wrote. Bullet holes were seen in the wall, and the reporters noted a handwritten paper about Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban for advocating for educational access for girls and women.  “We go to school every day of the week and we take it all for granted,” one student wrote. “We cry and complain without knowing how lucky we are to be able to learn.”  On the second floor, in room 1230, the reporters saw a heart-shaped box of Valentine’s Day chocolates. In room 1232, there were calculators still on school desks and open spiral notebooks where students were doing algebra. Bloodstains from more victims were seen on the third floor, they wrote, along with bullet scrapes along the wall and bullet holes in windows. In room 1255, the white board read, “How to write the perfect love letter” – the creative writing assignment for the day. In 1249, the reporters saw an unfinished chess game.   Patricia Oliver, mother of victim Joaquin Oliver, told CNN that she hoped “emotions” would be the jurors’ main takeaway after visiting the building Thursday, which would have been her son’s 22nd birthday. The building was closed to preserve it for the trial. Officials have said it will be torn down.  “We were, of course, knowing that this moment will arrive. It’s a moment that is part of a process,” said Manuel Oliver, Joaquin’s father, now an activist and organizer who addresses gun violence. “The most important thing here is what happened to our son, the way he suffered that day and what are we capable of doing after that. That’s what really matters here.” Jurors were not allowed to have a smartphone, smartwatch or any type of camera during the viewing. In court, attorneys encouraged the judge to ask jurors to wear closed-toe shoes because they could encounter glass on the floor.   ‘I can’t truly be happy if I smile,’ victim’s father testifies The current phase of the trial is to determine Cruz’s sentence: Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while Cruz’s defense attorneys are asking the jury for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. To recommend a death sentence, jurors must be unanimous. If they do so, the judge could choose to follow the recommendation or sentence Cruz to life instead. Following the visit, more victim impact statements were presented in court, with more of the victims’ families taking the stand to testify about the toll of the massacre and what their loved ones’ deaths have meant for them.  “I just can’t seem to really enjoy anything the way that I used to,” said Debra Hixon, the wife of athletic director Chris Hixon, who died trying to disarm the gunman. “The house that we shared doesn’t feel like the home that we built, because home meant Chris.”  Anne Ramsay, mother of 17-year-old victim Helena Ramsay, remembered her daughter as a beautiful and graceful young woman – someone who was naturally athletic but who preferred exercising her mind to competitive sport. She loved watching “Jeopardy!” Helena was killed on her father’s birthday, Anne Ramsay said. “That day will never be a celebration, and can never be the same for him,” she said, “and now is filled with pain, as is every day.” In a statement read by her niece, Hui Wang, the mother of Peter Wang, a 15-year-old shot as he held open a door to help his classmates get to safety, recalled how he was killed just before Chinese New Year, robbing the family of their most treasured holiday. “We no longer decorate our house or host feasts on the most important holiday in our family. It is now Peter’s death anniversary,” the statement, read by Wang’s cousin Lin Chen read. “This day of unity became a day that hurts the most.”   Much of the testimony in the Broward County court this week – particularly from the parents of the 14 students killed – has focused on all the things the victims and their families will never get to do and the irreparable damage to their everyday lives.  “Our family is broken. There is this constant emptiness,” said Max Schachter, the father of 14-year-old Alex, who loved chocolate chip cookies, playing the trombone and video games.  “I feel I can’t truly be happy if I smile,” Schachter said Wednesday. “I know that behind that smile is the sharp realization that part of me will always be sad and miserable because Alex isn’t here.” The loss of her daughter Meadow Pollack, 18, has “destroyed” Shara Kaplan’s life, she told the jury Tuesday, “and my capability of ever living a productive existence.” To articulate how her daughter’s death impacted her, she said, she would have to rip out her heart and show them how it had shattered into a million pieces. And the Hoyer family will never be the same. “We were a family unit of five always trying to fit into a world set up for even numbers,” said Tom Hoyer, whose 15-year-old son Luke – the youngest of three – was killed. “Two-, four-, six-seat tables in a restaurant. Two-, four-, six-ticket packages to events. Things like that.” But the Hoyers are no longer a family of five, and “never again will the world feel right, now that we’re a family of four,” Hoyer said. “When Luke died something went missing in me,” he said. “And I’ll never, never get over that feeling.” To make their sentencing decision, jurors will hear prosecutors and defense attorneys argue aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances – reasons Cruz should or should not be executed.  The victim impact statements add another layer, giving the families and friends of the victims their own day in court, though the judge told the jury the statements are not meant to be weighed as aggravating factors.

214,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/entertainment/nichelle-nichols-star-trek-dies/,"Actress and singer Nichelle Nichols, best known for her groundbreaking portrayal of Lt. Nyota Uhura in “Star Trek: The Original Series,” has died at age 89, according to a statement from her son, Kyle Johnson.  “Last night, my mother, Nichelle Nichols, succumbed to natural causes and passed away. Her light however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain for us and future generations to enjoy, learn from, and draw inspiration,” Johnson said in a statement shared to Nichols’ official site on Sunday. “Hers was a life well lived and as such a model for us all.” Nichols died from natural causes, he said. Nichols portrayed communications officer Lt. Nyota Uhura in the “Star Trek” TV series and many of its film offshoots.  When “Star Trek” began in 1966, Nichols was a television rarity: a Black woman in a notable role on a prime-time television series. There had been African-American women on TV before, but they often played domestic workers and had small roles; Nichols’ Uhura was an integral part of the multicultural “Star Trek” crew.  The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called it “the first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a Black woman in television history.”  Nichols is widely known for participating in one of the first interracial kisses on US television when her character kissed James T. Kirk, portrayed by White Canadian actor William Shatner. In an interview with CNN in 2014, Nichols said the kiss scene “changed television forever, and it also changed the way people looked at one another.” After “Trek’s” three-season run, Nichols dedicated herself to the space program. She helped NASA in making the agency more diverse, helping to recruit astronauts Sally Ride, Judith Resnik and Guion Bluford, among others. George Takei, who portrayed the USS Enterprise’s helmsman Hikaru Sulu, posted a touching tribute to his co-star. “I shall have more to say about the trailblazing, incomparable Nichelle Nichols, who shared the bridge with us as Lt. Uhura of the USS Enterprise, and who passed today at age 89,” wrote Takei on Twitter. “For today, my heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend.” “We lived long and prospered together,” he added with a photo of the pair making the iconic Vulcan salute.  The National Air and Space Museum called Nichols “an inspiration to many, not just for her groundbreaking work on Star Trek but also through her work with NASA to recruit women and people of color to apply to become astronauts” on Twitter. Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, also posted a tribute to the actress. “Godspeed to Nichelle Nichols, champion, warrior and tremendous actor,” wrote Abrams on Twitter alongside a photo of herself with Nichols. “Her kindness and bravery lit the path for many. May she forever dwell among the stars.” Nichols was born Grace Dell Nichols near Chicago in 1932. (Unhappy with Grace, she took the name Nichelle when she was a teenager.) Her grandfather was a White Southerner who married a Black woman, causing a rift in his family.  Blessed with a four-octave vocal range, Nichols was performing in local clubs by the time she was 14. Among the performers she met was Duke Ellington, who later took her on tour. She also worked extensively in Chicago clubs and in theater.  She moved to Los Angeles in the early ’60s and landed a role in a Gene Roddenberry series, “The Lieutenant.” A number of “Star Trek” veterans, including Leonard Nimoy, Walter Koenig and Majel Barrett, also worked on the show.  When Roddenberry was creating “Trek,” he remembered Nichols. She was in Europe when she got the call.  “(My agent said), ‘They’re doing ‘Star Trek,’ and I didn’t know what a ‘Star Trek’ was,” she said in an interview with the Television Academy. Uhura wasn’t in the original script, and Nichols was responsible for the name. She was reading a book called “Uhuru” – “freedom” in Swahili – and suggested her character take the name. Roddenberry thought it was too harsh.  “I said, ‘Well, why don’t you do an alteration of it, soften the end with an ‘A,’ and it’ll be Uhura?’ ” she recalled. “He said, ‘That’s it, that’s your name! You named it; it’s yours.’ ”  Nichols is survived by her son, Kyle Johnson.",Judith Resnik;William Shatner;Dell Nichols;Nichol Uhura;Guion Bluford;Majel Barrett;Hikaru Sulu;Los Angeles;Leonard Nimoy;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nichelle Nichols;Nyota Uhura;Nyota Uhura;Stacey Abrams;Martin Luther King Jr;Duke Ellington;Sally Ride;George Takei;Walter Koenig;Kyle Johnson;Kyle Johnson;Gene Roddenberry,Twitter;Twitter;Twitter;Space Museum;Cnn;Cnn;Television Academy,"MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,1771;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2658;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1001;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,1349;TAX_FNCACT_WOMAN,3404;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,1545;TAX_FNCACT_ACTOR,3041;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_COMMUNICATIONS_OFFICER,850;TAX_FNCACT_COMMUNICATIONS_OFFICER,850;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_LIEUTENANT,3796;TAX_FNCACT_LIEUTENANT,3796;TAX_FNCACT_NOMINEE,2921;TAX_FNCACT_VETERANS,3827;TAX_FNCACT_SINGER,21;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,1091;TAX_FNCACT_WOMEN,2806;KILL,149;KILL,776;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,149;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,776;TAX_FNCACT_AGENT,4026;MARITIME_INCIDENT,2141;MARITIME,2141;MEDIA_MSM,886;MEDIA_MSM,1097;TAX_ETHNICITY_SWAHILI,4284;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_SWAHILI,4284;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2240;MEDIA_SOCIAL,2865;MEDIA_SOCIAL,3067;RECRUITMENT,1851;RECRUITMENT,2800;DEMOCRACY,2899;TAX_ETHNICITY_CANADIAN,1539;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,12;TAX_FNCACT_ACTRESS,2971;TAX_FNCACT_KING,1276;TAX_FNCACT_WORKERS,1143;TAX_FNCACT_HELMSMAN,1980;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,850;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,850;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIAL,689;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,995;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,1343;TAX_ETHNICITY_BLACK,3398;",Georgia;Canadian;American;Chicago,972

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. How is it already August? It feels like summer is just speeding by, and I haven’t done even half of the things I wanted to do. What I have done in spades, though, is catch some really good streaming content. Settle in on the sofa for this week’s first offering, but be forewarned that some of its festive scenes may get you in the mood to jump up and bust some moves.   Three things to watch  ‘Wedding Season’ Many of us know about the pressure on single folks to get married. So the plot of this new film, in which two young professionals pretend to be a couple during summer wedding season to get their parents off their back, resonates. Of course, we know what happens as a result. Love a romantic comedy!  It’s streaming on Netflix. ‘Mike Judge’s Beavis and Butt-Head’ It’s the revival you may not have even known you needed. Our favorite airheaded teens have traveled from the 1990s to 2022, and we get a chance to enjoy their shenanigans yet again. There are some updates, of course, but the guys are still just as dim-witted as ever. Get ready for the nostalgia and the fun. The new series, which follows on the heels of the Paramount+ movie “Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe,” is streaming on the same platform. ‘Sweet Life: Los Angeles’ Season 2  Issa Rae is always giving us a slice of African American life. This reality series follows a group of young, ambitious Black friends who are pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. Naturally, it’s not all a bed of roses — it is television, after all — but this coming-of-age show offers lots of opportunity to witness growth. The second season of “Sweet Life: Los Angeles” is streaming on HBO Max, which is owned by CNN’s parent company. Two things to listen to Calvin Harris could have a music festival just with the artists featured on his latest project. “Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2” features collaborations with the likes of Justin Timberlake, Dua Lipa, Normani, Offset, Halsey, Pharrell and Snoop Dogg, to name a few. “I felt like the first one, the idea was there, but I didn’t fully carry it through,” the DJ/producer told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, as reported by Complex. “With this one, I wanted to have more live drums, guitars … I wanted the original essence. I wanted the layers and the grit and the dirt. And I don’t want things to be mixed too perfectly.” The album dropped Friday. Slim Shady has hits. Eminem is releasing “Curtain Call 2,” the second volume of his greatest hits. The album is “a hits collection comprised of the inimitable Detroit MC’s creative output since the 2005 release of Curtain Call: The Hits,” according to the rapper’s site.  “Curtain Call 2” will include music from all Eminem projects starting from 2009’s “Relapse,” including songs from various side projects, guest appearances and film soundtracks. His performance during this year’s Super Bowl halftime show has me so ready for this release, out now.  One thing to talk about The news that Zahara Jolie-Pitt will be attending Spelman College in Atlanta is quite a boon to HBCUs. As the daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, the teen had her choice of schools. And by choosing one of the best known of the historically Black colleges and universities to matriculate at, she brings a great deal of attention to the liberal arts college. Her mother proudly announced Jolie-Pitt’s choice on social media, and the excitement for her was palpable. I get it, as I count several Spelman graduates as good friends. A supportive sisterhood awaits Jolie-Pitt. Good luck to her and all the incoming freshmen across the nation this semester.  Something to sip on  Inclusion isn’t just about race. That’s the lesson that resonates with Beyoncé’s agreeing to remove an ableist slur from her latest hit album, “Renaissance.” After complaints that the song “Heated” contained a term that is derogatory to people with spastic cerebral palsy, reps for the singer confirmed that “the word, not used intentionally in a harmful way, will be replaced.” It’s a lesson that Lizzo also learned in a similar situation in June. She, too, was quick to rectify the issue.  Addressing these concerns goes beyond good public relations. It’s an example to us all about the need for sensitivity. \n\nWhat did you like about today’s newsletter? What did we miss?

614,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/us/car-drives-through-new-mexico-parade-gallup/,"An SUV driver who on Thursday evening allegedly struck people along a parade route in Gallup, New Mexico, has been accused of aggravated DWI and other charges, according to the New Mexico State Police. In total, 15 people with non-life-threatening injuries were transported to hospitals from the Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial Centennial Celebration event, state police officials said Friday in a news release. Gallup police were told several people in a Chevrolet Tahoe parked along the route of the Ceremonial Night Parade were drinking alcohol, according to state police. As officers approached the SUV, the driver took off and both officers were injured, state police said. “The Tahoe continued eastbound on West Coal Avenue toward parade participants while officers attempted to move spectators out of the Tahoe’s path,” the release says. A video taken by witness Sean Justice shows a group of people performing in the street when the crowd burst into screams, with people leaping up and rushing in the opposite direction of what appears to be a moving SUV. A statement from Gallup city officials said the SUV hit pedestrians, vehicles and a business before it was stopped. Another video captured by witness Keisha Joe shows what appears to be the SUV which was driven through the parade. In front of the SUV is a damaged car on the sidewalk, its front door crumpled in.  A 33-year-old man who was allegedly driving was arrested and is accused of aggravated DWI, one count of accident involving injury/great bodily harm, 14 counts of accident involving injury/not great bodily harm and other charges, according to state police. The man, a resident of Pinedale, had a suspended/revoked license, the news release said. Authorities said there is no evidence of a hate crime. The two male passengers in the SUV were taken to the Gallup Detox Center. “We are deeply saddened by this incident. We encourage everyone to attend the remaining Gallup Inter-Tribal Ceremonial events,” city officials said. “The city is working with multiple agencies to ensure safety is of the highest priority.  We will begin healing together in this celebration of cultural connections.” The Gallup Intertribal Ceremony will continue as scheduled. Thursday was the first night of the 11-day-long event. Another parade is scheduled for August 13, according to the event website. “We’re incredibly saddened and shocked by the life-threatening and traumatic incident that took place last night when a vehicle drove through the Ceremonial Night Parade,” Melissa Sanchez, the executive director of the New Mexico Tourism Department Intertribal Ceremonial Office, said in the release. “We await as law enforcement continues to gather the facts regarding this ongoing situation. Right now, safety is the top priority for community members, participants, travelers, and event staff and volunteers.” Gallup is in northwestern New Mexico, a little more than a two-hour drive west of Albuquerque. It is home to the Navajo Regional Office Bureau of Indian Affairs. “We are thankful that no lives were lost due to this senseless act by a few individuals. The perpetrators must be held accountable to the fullest extent. My family and I, as well as many of our Navajo people, witnessed the tragic events firsthand,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a news release. “We saw children who were shedding tears and people shaking with fear and we did our best to comfort them and let them know that everything would be OK.” Navajo Nation Council Speaker Seth Damon released a statement saying, “The Navajo Nation stands with resilience against any acts of violence and sends prayers of protection to those affected. This was a traumatic and triggering event for many, especially for our youth, elders, and our veterans who acted quickly.” “Hold Gallup in your prayers tonight as we come together in faith and strength for one another. May the Creator and Holy People bless you all tonight as we move forward together,” he said. CNN’s Amanda Jackson, Tina Burnside and Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.

20,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/01/weather/california-mckinney-fire-monday/,"A wildfire in Northern California that exploded in size over the weekend has killed at least two people, forced thousands to evacuate and grown into the state’s largest wildfire this year, with lightning Monday threatening its further expansion. The McKinney Fire broke out Friday afternoon in the Klamath National Forest near the California-Oregon border and has since ripped through more than 55,000 acres, advancing on homes and forcing nearly 2,000 residents to evacuate Saturday, authorities said.  The blaze has become California’s largest wildfire so far this year, Cal Fire Capt. Chris Bruno told CNN. Two people were found dead Sunday morning inside a vehicle that burned in the path of the fire, the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office said. The two were found on a residential driveway along Doggett Creek Road near Highway 96, the sheriff’s office posted Monday morning on Facebook. Officials have not released any more information on them. As the weekend ended, the blaze was 0% contained, and firefighters face a long battle ahead as lightning and thunderstorms complicated efforts while the flames raced through dry vegetation. Heavy smoke over the fire helped slow its growth Sunday but also kept firefighting aircraft grounded, the US Forest Service said in a Sunday night update. Oregon state Rep. Dacia Grayber her husband, both firefighters, were camping near the California state line when they woke up Saturday to orange skies, hot wind gusts, lightning and blowing ash, she said on Twitter. They evacuated from the campground knowing one of them may return on deployment if the fire grows. “In 22+ yrs of fire I’ve never experienced anything like this fire behavior at night. It felt absolutely surreal and not just a little apocalyptic,” Grayber tweeted. The fire is just one symptom of the American West’s historic drought and the human-caused climate change crisis, which has caused more frequent and more severe wildfires. California’s persistent drought conditions have set the scene for rapid fire spread in the forest, with the fires burning extremely dry, receptive fuels, according to the forest service. Sprinting through dry brush, grass and timber, the fire activity has been extreme, with the flames running uphill, and spotting further out, according to fire officials. “Klamath National Forest is a big and beautiful forest, but it also has some steep and rugged terrain. And with that, coupled with the high temperatures, low humidity, they all come into play and make it a very extreme fire danger situation right now,” Tom Stokesberry of the US Forest Service told CNN affiliate KTVL. Over 2 million under red flag warnings Monday The fire risk could intensify Monday. “Abundant lightning” is expected through Monday, as well as scattered thunderstorms, which could spread the flames out further, according to the National Weather Service. “These conditions can be extremely dangerous for firefighters, as winds can be erratic and extremely strong, causing fire to spread in any direction,” forest service officials said in a news release. Dry thunderstorms like those occurring over the weekend happen when rainfall evaporates before ever hitting the ground, leaving only lightning strikes capable of sparking new fires and fueling existing ones, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. More than 2 million people are under red flag warnings Monday in parts of northern California, central Oregon, eastern Washington, Montana, eastern Wyoming, western South Dakota and northwestern Nebraska, CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. And it isn’t the only blaze crews have to contend with. There were 10 different wildfires burning in the Klamath National Forest Sunday afternoon, forest officials said. The fires generated their own weather in the form of pyrocumulus clouds, which are created from the intense heat of the fire forcing air to rise. Tor Mason was one of the hundreds evacuated due to the McKinney Fire. He and his friends fled their homes and arrived at the Klamath River Community Center, only to find the fire closing in, he told CNN affiliate KDRV. “When I got to the community center it was almost on fire. I’m like, “Holy crap, this isn’t good,” Mason said. “So I put the … pedal to the metal and I boogied. … I heard this morning it shot up in flames.” The fire left a path of destroyed vehicles, scorched structures and haze-filled skies along Highway 96, according to video recorded Saturday by Kirk Eadie, EMS manager for Happy Camp Ambulance. About 650 firefighting personnel have converged on the blaze, attacking the flames from the ground and the air and working to defend evacuated homes. Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency Saturday for Siskiyou County, saying the blaze has destroyed homes and threatened critical infrastructure. Cal Fire said no information was available on structures damaged by the McKinney Fire, though Stokesberry told KTVL there were unconfirmed reports of lost structures. On Saturday, about 60 people were evacuated from the Pacific Crest Trail as the McKinney Fire approached, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon said on its Facebook page, noting the hikers were rescued from the “California side of the Red Buttes Wilderness.” CNN’s Holly Yan, Eric Levenson, David Williams, Paradise Afshar, Tina Burnside, Amanda Jackson and Claire Colbert contributed to this report.",Chris Bruno;Robert Shackelford;Robert Shackelford;Gavin Newsom;Dacia Grayber;Claire Colbert;Amanda Jackson;Tina Burnside;Tom Stokesberry,Twitter;National Weather Service;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Cnn;Facebook;Us Forest Service;Us Forest Service,"TAX_FNCACT_METEOROLOGIST,2236;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,288;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,573;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,1972;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2629;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,2655;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3359;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3442;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3662;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3690;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,3917;WB_566_ENVIRONMENT_AND_NATURAL_RESOURCES,4049;WB_1777_FORESTS,288;WB_1777_FORESTS,573;WB_1777_FORESTS,1972;WB_1777_FORESTS,2629;WB_1777_FORESTS,2655;WB_1777_FORESTS,3359;WB_1777_FORESTS,3442;WB_1777_FORESTS,3662;WB_1777_FORESTS,3690;WB_1777_FORESTS,3917;WB_1777_FORESTS,4049;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,288;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,573;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,1972;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2629;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,2655;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3359;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3442;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3662;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3690;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,3917;WB_590_ECOSYSTEMS,4049;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,288;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,573;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1972;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2629;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,2655;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3359;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3442;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3662;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3690;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,3917;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,4049;TAX_WORLDMAMMALS_HORSE,3960;CRISISLEX_O01_WEATHER,1130;WATER_SECURITY,3293;NATURAL_DISASTER_DROUGHT,3293;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,15;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,132;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,830;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,911;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRE,2430;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,15;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,132;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,830;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,911;CRISISLEX_T01_CAUTION_ADVICE,2430;POLITICAL_TURMOIL,4281;STATE_OF_EMERGENCY,4281;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,2832;TAX_FNCACT_MASON,3160;BORDER,321;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,4722;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,4722;CRISISLEX_T04_INFRASTRUCTURE,4364;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,451;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,451;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,451;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,2811;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,4192;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,972;TAX_WORLDLANGUAGES_OREGON,4739;NATURAL_DISASTER_WILDFIRES,2575;ARMEDCONFLICT,697;CRISISLEX_T09_DISPLACEDRELOCATEDEVACUATED,94;CRISISLEX_C04_LOGISTICS_TRANSPORT,4467;AFFECT,428;EVACUATION,428;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,539;CRISISLEX_O02_RESPONSEAGENCIESATCRISIS,4105;MEDIA_SOCIAL,1178;DISASTER_FIRE,482;DISASTER_FIRE,1269;DISASTER_FIRE,2799;DISASTER_FIRE,3014;DISASTER_FIRE,3506;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,1990;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,2665;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,3620;UNREST_BELLIGERENT,1509;NATURAL_DISASTER_STRONG_WINDS,1541;",Yreka;Siskiyou;Jackson County;Oregon;Red Buttes Wilderness;Klamath;California,1073

Schwartz testified that Jones withdrew about $62 million dollars from the company over 14 years, and testified that $30 million of those withdrawals was paid to the IRS.  Schwartz also testified during the hearing, which ran for more than six hours, that Infowars received about $9 million in cryptocurrency donations and that “they went directly to Mr. Jones.” Schwartz said during his testimony that Free Speech Systems should be allowed to use cash it has on hand to be able to pay vendors, saying otherwise it will have to shut down.  “If we can’t pay the critical vendors then we will be shut down,” Schwartz said. “The company’s in a situation right now where there’s not a whole lot of breathing room.”  US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez said Wednesday he would not permit more withdrawals moving forward and that he found some of Schwartz’s testimony “troubling.”  Court documents filed Friday as part of Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy showed the company has between $10 million and $50 million in estimated assets and between $50 million and $100 million in estimated liabilities. An attorney for Free Speech Systems said at the hearing Wednesday that the company has about $1.3 million cash on hand.  Schwartz stressed the importance of being able to pay vendors that allow the company to broadcast and sell products online, saying that when Jones is not on the air discussing products he sells, the company sees a 30% drop in sales. “If we can’t broadcast, we can’t sell,” Schwartz said.  Schwartz testified the management structure of Free Speech Systems was not set up the way a successful business should be managed.  “There is Alex and then there is everybody else,” Schwartz testified.  Schwartz said accounting controls were, as far as he could tell after taking control of the company, “nonexistent,” that the people responsible for maintaining the company’s books did not have accounting degrees and that there had been no financial reports produced in at least 18 months when he took over.  Lawyers homed in on Jones’ salary under the bankruptcy plan, saying documents showed Jones’ salary before the bankruptcy was $625,000 a year, and under a restructuring plan, it would amount to about $1.3 million. Schwartz said Jones’ salary could be considered reasonable because of his value to the company.  “Who is more valuable? Nobody,” Schwartz said. Lopez authorized a lower salary for Jones to be paid, of about $20,000 every other week.  When asked how much the company had spent on legal expenses related to the Sandy Hook lawsuits, Schwartz said company records show at least $4.5 million have been spent between 2018 and 2021, but that he does not believe that number is accurate.  Schwartz also testified that Jones used a company-associated American Express card to pay for personal expenses, including housekeeping charges, regularly in the past 18 months. The card had $300,000 a month in charges, but Schwartz said accounting staff did not label what the charges were for.  “We can’t tell you whether it’s for electricity, entertainment or electronic supplies for the production studio,” Schwartz said.  Lopez said he would not authorize the current American Express bill of about $172,000 to be paid.   Schwartz said he didn’t know who Jones was before being hired, and that he doesn’t agree with many of Jones’ views but occasionally consults with him on matters involving the business.  Three smaller companies tied to Jones declared bankruptcy earlier this year, briefly pausing the suits against Jones. But the families suing him dropped those companies from their lawsuits so that the cases could move forward against only Jones and Free Speech Systems. Shortly after, the companies exited bankruptcy protection.  – CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed reporting.",Marc Schwartz;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Alex Jone;Christopher Lopez,Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;Schwartz;American Express;American Express;Cnn,"EXTREMISM,66;UNGP_FORESTS_RIVERS_OCEANS,1603;TAX_FNCACT_CHILD,667;TAX_FNCACT_JUDGE,1759;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2314;WB_678_DIGITAL_GOVERNMENT,2471;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2314;WB_694_BROADCAST_AND_MEDIA,2471;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2314;WB_133_INFORMATION_AND_COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGIES,2471;TRIAL,185;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEYS,185;INFO_HOAX,597;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,3972;TAX_ETHNICITY_AMERICAN,4376;TAX_FNCACT_CHIEF,740;ECON_BITCOIN,1109;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,13;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,2617;EPU_ECONOMY_HISTORIC,4599;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,116;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,324;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1436;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,1951;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2125;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,2564;SELF_IDENTIFIED_HUMAN_RIGHTS,4856;FREESPEECH,116;FREESPEECH,324;FREESPEECH,1436;FREESPEECH,1951;FREESPEECH,2125;FREESPEECH,2564;FREESPEECH,4856;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,2109;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3348;TAX_FNCACT_ATTORNEY,3450;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,244;TAX_FNCACT_VICTIMS,549;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,244;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,549;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,244;CRISISLEX_T08_MISSINGFOUNDTRAPPEDPEOPLE,549;TAX_FNCACT_LAWYERS,3010;TAX_FNCACT_ACCOUNTANT,28;TAX_MILITARY_TITLE_OFFICER,762;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICER,762;WB_1921_PRIVATE_SECTOR_DEVELOPMENT,1812;WB_405_BUSINESS_CLIMATE,1812;WB_2531_INSPECTIONS_LICENSING_AND_PERMITS,1812;WB_2530_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT,1812;",American;Sandy Hook;Texas,915
106,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/31/politics/biden-second-term-joe-manchin-cnntv/,"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia refused to say Sunday whether he thinks President Joe Biden deserves a second term in office.  “I’m not getting involved in any election right now. 2022, 2024, I’m not speculating on it. President Biden is my president right now. I’m going to work with him and his administration to the best of my ability to help the people in my state of West Virginia and this country,” Manchin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” when asked whether he thinks Biden deserves to be reelected in two years.  Biden lost Manchin’s home state of West Virginia by 39 points in 2020.   Asked by NBC on Sunday if he hopes Democrats keep control of the US House and the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections, Manchin again appeared reticent, saying: “You know, I’m not making those choices or decisions on that.”  “I’m going to work with whatever I have. I’ve always said that. I think the Democrats have great candidates that are running. They’re good people I’ve worked with. And I have a tremendous amount of respect and friendship with my Republican colleagues,” he said. “So I can work on either side very easily.” The comments from Manchin, a moderate Democrat whose reluctance to support some of Biden’s domestic agenda has at times prevented the President from achieving some legislative goals, further underscore his unpredictable nature as a swing vote within the party. They also come as more and more Democrats say they want someone other than Biden as their presidential nominee in 2024.  A CNN poll released last week found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than the President in the 2024 election, a sharp increase from earlier this year. The results accompany low approval ratings for Biden amid widespread discontent with the state of the country and the economy.  An earlier CNN Poll, conducted in January and February, showed 51% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters saying they wanted someone other than Biden to be the Democratic nominee in the next presidential election. The White House said last year that Biden intends to run for reelection in 2024, following a report indicating that the commander in chief and his staff are attempting to assuage concerns about his future political prospects. Last week, Manchin handed the President a potential legislative victory after he and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal on a major energy and health care bill that represented a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again. Manchin told Tapper on Sunday that Biden deserved credit for the agreement.  “You don’t do a bill this magnitude and this size without the President knowing what’s going on, the President being involved in, to a certain extent, but also giving approval. And that’s what President Biden did,” he said. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.

270,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/election-deniers-tuesday-primaries-arizona-michigan/,"Republican voters in several key swing states could select election deniers as their nominees for governorships and other top offices in primaries Tuesday. The issue is at the heart of high-profile races in Arizona and Michigan – two of the most important presidential battlegrounds – weeks after Republican voters elsewhere selected promoters of former President Donald Trump’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election as nominees for several posts that could position them to manage key states’ election machinery in 2024. Arizona, in particular, has been the epicenter of Trump’s election denialism. Once a Republican stronghold, the state has become one of the nation’s most competitive, with Democrats winning the presidential race and both Senate seats there in recent years. That political shift was met with a sham, partisan review of the 2020 election results ordered last year by the GOP-led state Senate.  Here’s a look at the election deniers on the ballot in key races Tuesday in the Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington state primaries:  Arizona The GOP could be poised to nominate a statewide ticket of Trump-backed election deniers on Tuesday.  In the race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, Trump-endorsed former television journalist Kari Lake has built her campaign around lies about election fraud. She referred to the refusal of her leading rival, Ducey-backed Karrin Taylor Robson, to indulge those lies as “disqualifying.” The race for secretary of state – Arizona’s chief elections officer – also features an election denier endorsed by Trump in Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker who was in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, and wrongly claims that Trump won the 2020 election. Trump-backed Blake Masters, who is seeking to face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, hasn’t just claimed that Democrats “pulled out all the stops” to cheat in 2020, but has suggested the 2022 midterms won’t be fair. Masters faces other Republicans who have rejected the 2020 election outcome, including businessman Jim Lamon, who touts his efforts to fund the bogus review of Maricopa County’s 2020 results. Another candidate, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, sent a letter claiming to have uncovered election fraud, without detailing any fraud in how the election was managed.  Trump’s chosen candidate in the race for attorney general, Abraham Hamadeh, said he would “take the fraud in our 2020 election seriously and bring justice to those who’ve undermined our Republic.”  Michigan Trump on Friday endorsed Tudor Dixon in the wide-open Republican primary to take on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is seeking her second term.  Dixon, a conservative commentator, has falsely claimed that Trump won the 2020 election. She is also backed by Michigan’s GOP establishment, including former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ family, the state Chamber of Commerce and Michigan Right to Life.  That GOP gubernatorial primary features several other election deniers, as well. One candidate, Ryan Kelley, was in Washington on January 6, 2021, and has pleaded not guilty to four misdemeanor charges stemming from allegations of his participation in the riot at the US Capitol. Retired pastor Ralph Rebandt said he is “convinced that we would find the fraud” in the 2020 election with a “full forensic audit.” And chiropractor Garrett Soldano has touted a film that promotes an unproven conspiracy theory about the 2020 election.  In the Grand Rapids-based 3rd Congressional District, Rep. Peter Meijer – one of 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment following the insurrection at the Capitol – faces a Trump-backed challenger in John Gibbs.   Gibbs has fully embraced Trump’s election lies. He wrongly claimed in a debate with Meijer that the results that led to Biden’s win in 2020 were “simply mathematically impossible” and said that there were “anomalies in there, to put it very lightly.”  Democrats have attempted to boost Gibbs – whom they believe would be easier to beat in November’s general election – with ads casting him as a Trump-aligned conservative.  Michigan Republicans are also expected to pick Trump-backed election deniers in the races for secretary of state and attorney general. At a convention in April, the state GOP endorsed Kristina Karamo, an educator and right-wing commentator who claimed to have witnessed irregularities in 2020’s election, for secretary of state, and Matthew DePerno, who was a lawyer on a case challenging the 2020 results, for attorney general. But those races aren’t on Tuesday’s primary ballot; instead, Republicans will make their choices official at a party convention in August.  Missouri Missouri’s Republican primary to replace retiring Sen. Roy Blunt features a field packed with candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.  State Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s campaign has run ads touting his role in a lawsuit seeking to overturn Pennsylvania’s 2020 election results.  Former Gov. Eric Greitens, who is attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2018 amid a sex scandal and accusations of campaign misconduct, has promoted conspiracy theories about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose nonprofit gave municipalities millions of dollars in grants to administer the 2020 election. Greitens’ campaign hosted a screening of a film promoting that conspiracy theory. He has also called for Arizona to decertify its 2020 election results, citing a sham, partisan review conducted last year. And he has called for election audits around the nation.  St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey has wrongly claimed that President Joe Biden did not win the 2020 election. Rep. Vicky Hartzler said that “we will never know” who won in 2020.  Hartzler and Rep. Billy Long, another Senate candidate, both voted against certifying Biden’s election victory in January 2021. Washington Two more of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump face primary challengers backed by the former President and have embraced his lies about the 2020 election.  Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler faces a primary challenge from Trump-backed Joe Kent, who claimed “rampant voter fraud” had taken place in 2020 in an ad his campaign ran on Facebook.  Rep. Dan Newhouse faces Loren Culp, the Republican who lost Washington’s 2020 gubernatorial race and then filed a lawsuit against the state’s chief elections officer, alleging widespread fraud. Culp’s attorney then withdrew the lawsuit after Washington’s attorney general said he would ask a judge to impose sanctions over the “factually baseless” allegations.  Kansas Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican who oversaw the state’s 2020 election, has defended the legitimacy of the voting process there. However, he faces a primary challenger, former Johnson County commissioner Mike Brown, who has built his campaign on casting doubt on elections’ integrity and blamed Schwab for local oversight issues.  “The 2020 election still has me questioning the integrity and accuracy of our election process,” Brown says in a campaign video.",Matthew Deperno;Eric Greitens;Vicky Hartzler;Mark Zuckerberg;Joe

435,https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/entertainment/anne-heche-car-crash/,"Anne Heche remains hospitalized and in intensive care after a car she was driving crashed into a residence in Los Angeles on Friday and became engulfed in flames. “Anne is in the ICU, she’s lucky to be alive. She has severe burns and has a long recovery ahead. Her team and her family are still trying to process what led up to the crash,” a source close to Heche told CNN Saturday morning. The vehicle was traveling at a high speed when it ran off the road and collided with a residence, Los Angeles Police Public Information Officer Jeff Lee told CNN on Friday.  Heche was taken to a hospital by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics in critical condition. It took firefighters more than an hour to “access, confine and fully extinguish the stubborn flames within the heavily damaged structure,” the LAFD said. There were no other injuries reported. A representative for Heche released the following statement:  “Anne is currently in stable condition. Her family and friends ask for your thoughts and prayers and to respect her privacy during this difficult time.” On Saturday, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN authorities had yet to question Heche about the circumstances of the incident.  The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the crash and a previous “misdemeanor hit and run” incident, an LAPD spokesperson told CNN Saturday evening.  LAPD said no arrests have been made.  Heche remained in hospital as of Saturday evening and the significant nature of her injuries have prevented officers from interviewing her, the law enforcement source added.  Hours before Heche’s crash on Friday, a new episode of her podcast “Better Together,” was released but it has since been removed from their Apple Podcast landing page. During a portion of the podcast, Heche and her co-host, Heather Duffy, discuss drinking vodka and wine and Heche talks about having a “bad day.” It’s unclear when the podcast was recorded. CNN has reached out to Heche’s representatives for comment. “Today’s been a very unique day,” Heche says in the podcast. “I don’t know what happened, sometimes days just suck and I don’t know if you ever have them, but some days Mama says are … some days are those no good very bad days.  And I don’t know why some days just end up like this, and things don’t really rock me like that.” Heche first rose to fame on the soap opera “Another World,” where she played the dual role of twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love from 1987 to 1991 and earned a Daytime Emmy Award. She followed that with films like “Donnie Brasco,” “Six Days Seven Nights,” and “Wag the Dog.” Her romantic relationship with Ellen DeGeneres in the late ’90s resulted in intense media attention, much to Heche’s professional frustration. In a 2021 interview with Page Six, Heche said she felt “blacklisted” after going public with their relationship. “I didn’t do a studio picture for 10 years,” said Heche, who dated DeGeneres from 1997 to 2000.  Heche has appeared in numerous television series more recently, including “The Brave,” “Quantico” and “Chicago P.D.” She has several acting projects currently in post-production, according to her IMDB profile.

102,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/michigan-cyclists-killed-suv/,"Two cyclists were killed and three were injured Saturday morning when an SUV crossed over the center line while trying to pass another vehicle, Michigan authorities said.  The five cyclists were all participating in the Make-A-Wish bicycle tour, a three-day fundraising event and endurance ride that spans most of the state, according to the Ionia County Sheriff’s Office.  The cyclists were traveling southbound when the SUV, which was traveling northbound, crossed the center line, the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post.  Ionia County is roughly 40 miles east of Grand Rapids.  One cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene while another died from injuries at a nearby hospital, the sheriff’s office said. The three surviving cyclists were transported to hospitals with severe injuries, officials added.  The driver of the SUV was arrested on two counts of Operating while Intoxicated Causing Death and taken to the Ionia County Jail, the sheriff’s office added. Authorities did not release the driver’s name pending charges and an arraignment. The names of the cyclists were also not released. An investigation is ongoing, the sheriff’s office added.  The Make-a-Wish Foundation expressed its condolences towards the cyclists and their loved ones in a statement shared with CNN. “Our staff and the entire Make-A-Wish family are heartbroken and offer our deepest sympathy for the riders involved, their loved ones, and all members of the WAM community during this difficult time,” the organization said. “We are thankful to the first responders who arrived immediately to save lives. We are supporting our riders, staff, and volunteers with grief counseling and assisting with the law enforcement investigation.”",,Facebook;Cnn,"MEDIA_SOCIAL,522;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_JAIL,983;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITALS,789;WB_2024_ANTI_CORRUPTION_AUTHORITIES,1158;WB_696_PUBLIC_SECTOR_MANAGEMENT,1158;WB_840_JUSTICE,1158;WB_2025_INVESTIGATION,1158;WB_831_GOVERNANCE,1158;WB_832_ANTI_CORRUPTION,1158;WB_1014_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE,1158;MANMADE_DISASTER_IMPLIED,136;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,854;TAX_FNCACT_DRIVER,1050;GENERAL_HEALTH,707;MEDICAL,707;SOC_POINTSOFINTEREST_HOSPITAL,707;KILL,27;CRISISLEX_T03_DEAD,27;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,361;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,496;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,721;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,997;TAX_FNCACT_SHERIFF,1183;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,361;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,496;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,721;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,997;CRISISLEX_C07_SAFETY,1183;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,159;TAX_FNCACT_AUTHORITIES,1023;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,159;EPU_POLICY_AUTHORITIES,1023;WB_1428_INJURY,686;WB_1428_INJURY,810;WB_1406_DISEASES,686;WB_1406_DISEASES,810;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,686;WB_621_HEALTH_NUTRITION_AND_POPULATION,810;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,686;WB_1427_NON_COMMUNICABLE_DISEASE_AND_INJURY,810;TAX_FNCACT_OFFICIALS,822;WB_135_TRANSPORT,776;ARREST,878;SOC_GENERALCRIME,878;WOUND,44;CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC,44;CRISISLEX_C03_WELLBEING_HEALTH,44;CRISISLEX_T02_INJURED,44;",Grand Rapids;Ionia County;Michigan,333
