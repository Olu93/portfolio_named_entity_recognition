        "content": "A drug is available for monkeypox patients who have or who are at risk of severe disease, but doctors say they continue to face challenges getting access to it. The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US. Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox. It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access."

But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home. But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr."

As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center.

In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center. The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals."

How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox. “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead. Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic."

She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up.

        "content": "Lawrence and Bianca Rudolph shared a passion for big game hunting. In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents. Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported."

After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents. Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies."

Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states. A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support. If convicted of murder, Rudolph faces a maximum of life in prison or the death penalty."

Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet."

        "content": "A drug is available for monkeypox patients who have or who are at risk of severe disease, but doctors say they continue to face challenges getting access to it. The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US. Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox. It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access. However, doctors across the country suggest that significant barriers remain, causing some patients to wait days for shipments or travel to find medical centers that can provide the product at all. “Patients are trying hard to get this medication, even going out of city or out of state in some cases,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health."

And very significantly, we have not seen any significant adverse events reported and very few even mild adverse events. Some headaches, nausea. But that’s pretty much it,” Foote said. However, it’s unclear what proportion of the more than 5,000 probable or confirmed cases nationwide have been treated with Tpoxx. CDC officials said in a webinar that more than 223 people had been treated as of July 22, but the agency did not respond to requests for a more specific number. Experts say the number who’ve been treated is probably a fraction of those eligible. “I think a majority of patients don’t have access,” Chin-Hong said. He’s seen firsthand how hard it can be to get the drug. Chin-Hong treated Kevin Kwong, 34, after he developed painful lesions all over his hands, feet and face that spread to his back, thighs and scalp. “There were moments I could barely swallow food because of the sores in the back of my throat,” Kwong said. Lesions near his eye threatened to have long-term effects on his vision. But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home. But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr."

Chin-Hong says that aside from the paperwork, there’s a high “activation energy” that clinics and hospitals face because the drug is considered experimental for monkeypox and some hospitals and institutions require additional reviews for such treatments. As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center. A Pennsylvania man named Adam says it also took him several days to get access to Tpoxx. Adam had a fever, swollen lymph nodes and body aches, he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The rashes that characterize monkeypox appeared around his groin, arms, throat and face. “I would kind of liken it to a crossbreed of Covid, strep throat, mono, kind of all those things together is how monkeypox felt, in addition to the pox, which, that was an experience for sure,” he said. His doctors were concerned that one lesion under an eyelash could affect his vision."

In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center. The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals."

How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox. “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead. Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic."

I think that’s a very serious, serious balancing,” Cheney said. “The question for us is, are we a nation of laws? Are we a country where no one is above the law? And what do the facts and the evidence show?” Cheney said. She sidestepped questions about whether Trump being prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department would only add to his strength with the Republican Party’s base ahead of the 2024 presidential bid that Trump has repeatedly teased. “I don’t think that it’s appropriate to think about it that way,” said Cheney, who’s facing a Trump-backed challenger in a primary later this month. She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up. The House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections. Cheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot. “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters."

However, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017. “We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.” Asked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make."

        "content": "I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.” Cheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024. She said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not. Cheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall. Republicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan. “I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024. “I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said. Cheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him. Cheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.” “All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.” CLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.

McDaniel was joined by former White House chief of staff and onetime RNC chairman Reince Priebus, along with members of the party’s Wisconsin delegation for the announcement. “In the next two years, we look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the community to make this an event that highlights not just our nominee … but the great city that Milwaukee is,” McDaniel said. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, defended the decision to host the convention in his city, telling CNN the move “does not mean” Milwaukee is “signing up for the platform of the Republican Party.”  “My stance, and I think that most Democrats understand this, is that this is not a political decision, it is a business decision,” Johnson said. “It will present an opportunity for us to have millions of dollars of economic impact … for us to fill our restaurants, our bars, our hotels, and to support our hospitality industry that’s been battered by Covid, of course, over the last couple of years.”  Johnson joined McDaniel Friday to officially unveil Milwaukee as the convention site choice, just days after Nashville fell out of contention as a potential alternative. Milwaukee began its bid to be a convention host nearly a year ago, and city representatives met with RNC officials in February as they toured finalist cities, which included Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh at the time."

Later Friday, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha to campaign for Tim Michels, the GOP candidate for governor, ahead of the state’s primary next week. Trump’s sustained popularity with the GOP base would likely position him as a front-runner in a crowded 2024 GOP primary should he launch another presidential campaign, as is widely expected. Johnson, who said he will actively campaign for President Joe Biden’s reelection in 2024, dismissed security concerns about protests around the convention in Milwaukee, including if Trump – one of the most polarizing figures in American politics – is the Republican nominee. “I think that any time you host a large-scale event, there is potential for that sort of activity. Our police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention,” Johnson said, noting that Milwaukee was originally supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention before it switched to a virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The police in Milwaukee are already well prepared for this and will really be in a prime position to execute what we were about to execute the last go-round,” Johnson said."

In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents. Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported."

CNN has reached out to Rudolph’s attorney, David Markus, but has not heard back. In a motion Markus filed in January listing his client’s assets, he said Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In the court document, he noted that Rudolph is worth millions, including a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million. Life insurance companies based in Colorado paid Rudolph over $4.8 million after his wife’s death, according to court documents.

After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents. Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. “Zambian authorities and five insurers determined that Bianca Rudolph died accidentally.

        "content": "Rudolph did nothing to interfere in the investigation. No physical evidence supports the government’s murder theory,” Markus wrote in the January motion. The suspect wanted to be with his girlfriend, prosecutors allege But federal investigators say there’s more to the story. Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleges. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of the victim reached out to the FBI and asked the agency to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs in the past and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death. Rudolph’s then-girlfriend, who was not named in the court documents, worked as a manager at his dental practice near Pittsburgh, and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, Peterson wrote. The former employee told the FBI that the girlfriend told her she gave Rudolph an ultimatum of one year to sell his dental offices and leave his wife, court documents allege. Three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, the girlfriend moved in with him, Peterson wrote in court documents. An executive director of their subdivision’s community association told investigators that Rudolph and his girlfriend tried to buy another home in the same subdivision for $3.5 million. Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states. A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support. If convicted of murder, Rudolph faces a maximum of life in prison or the death penalty."

        "content": "The Atlanta music festival Music Midtown, which draws tens of thousands of concertgoers and blockbuster musicians each year, “will no longer be taking place this year,” organizers announced in a tweet Monday. Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet."

        "content": "A drug is available for monkeypox patients who have or who are at risk of severe disease, but doctors say they continue to face challenges getting access to it. The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US. Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox. It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access. However, doctors across the country suggest that significant barriers remain, causing some patients to wait days for shipments or travel to find medical centers that can provide the product at all. “Patients are trying hard to get this medication, even going out of city or out of state in some cases,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health."

        "content": "Dr. Mary Foote, medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in late July that about 20% to 25% of patients there have met the criteria for Tpoxx. As of July 23, the treatment had been prescribed for about 215 out of 839 confirmed cases. “Anecdotally, of the providers that we’ve spoken to, we’ve seen, very commonly, significant improvements within just a few days of starting and improvements in pain. And very significantly, we have not seen any significant adverse events reported and very few even mild adverse events. Some headaches, nausea. But that’s pretty much it,” Foote said. However, it’s unclear what proportion of the more than 5,000 probable or confirmed cases nationwide have been treated with Tpoxx. CDC officials said in a webinar that more than 223 people had been treated as of July 22, but the agency did not respond to requests for a more specific number. Experts say the number who’ve been treated is probably a fraction of those eligible. “I think a majority of patients don’t have access,” Chin-Hong said. He’s seen firsthand how hard it can be to get the drug. Chin-Hong treated Kevin Kwong, 34, after he developed painful lesions all over his hands, feet and face that spread to his back, thighs and scalp. “There were moments I could barely swallow food because of the sores in the back of my throat,” Kwong said. Lesions near his eye threatened to have long-term effects on his vision. But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home. But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr."

        "content": "Jason Zucker, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Chin-Hong says that aside from the paperwork, there’s a high “activation energy” that clinics and hospitals face because the drug is considered experimental for monkeypox and some hospitals and institutions require additional reviews for such treatments. As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center. A Pennsylvania man named Adam says it also took him several days to get access to Tpoxx. Adam had a fever, swollen lymph nodes and body aches, he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The rashes that characterize monkeypox appeared around his groin, arms, throat and face. “I would kind of liken it to a crossbreed of Covid, strep throat, mono, kind of all those things together is how monkeypox felt, in addition to the pox, which, that was an experience for sure,” he said. His doctors were concerned that one lesion under an eyelash could affect his vision. “He had a lesion on the inside of his lid, but if that would rupture, he would auto-inoculate his eye and could get a keratitis,” said Dr. Stacy Lane of the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, who treated Adam. She worried that it could put him at risk of blindness. “By the time I was initially seen and talked about the eyeball, I wasn’t put on the antiviral until almost a week later,” Adam said. In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center. The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals."

        "content": "Every region or every area will have its own problem,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York. “If you’re a private physician or your clinic doesn’t have access to Tpoxx immediately, you might have it shipped from the national stockpile, and you have to have a full process – you know, guidelines, shipping itself takes time, filling out the paperwork – so that can take a couple of days. “In New York City, you’re able to e-prescribe with certain pharmacies that would be able to make sure the appropriate paperwork is filled out to go and have that delivered in a much faster time,” he said. How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox. “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead. Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The unfortunate parallel is that the US is behind the UK and Europe in running these trials,” he said. Lane said she’s hopeful that the CDC and public health departments will continue to work toward better access to the medication. But her expectations are measured. “Until the FDA approves this for monkeypox or the National Stockpile releases the stockpile for more normal distribution, this is where we’re at,” she said."

She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up. The House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections. Cheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot. “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Dick Cheney adds. Liz Cheney wouldn’t say whether her father has urged her to run for president in 2024. “Look, Dick Cheney is a big Liz Cheney supporter,” she said. She said the former vice president shares “this real sadness, frankly, about what’s happening to our party, and a real despair about how it could be that so many Republicans would refuse to stand up and tell the truth.” “And it is a scary moment for the nation,” she added. Cheney says more to come from the committee this fall  Liz Cheney, who has courted Democratic voters in Wyoming’s primary, said she doesn’t see the House committee’s work through the lens of political outcomes. Cheney said the House panel will continue to lay out evidence in the coming months and that she expects the committee to “have an opinion” about making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “There’s much more that we have not yet shared in hearings and that we anticipate we will share in the fall,” she said. “And we will also make decisions about criminal referrals."

        "content": "And ultimately, the decision about prosecution’s up to the Justice Department. But I would anticipate that the committee will have an opinion on it.”  Cheney said that during the committee’s probe, she has learned that Trump’s effort to block the 2020 election results were “a more sophisticated and broader-reaching effort than I understood coming into it.”  “I think all of us on the committee have had that same reaction, which is that there’s so much, there was so much more that was happening in multiple different areas, whether it was the pressure on state officials or the pressure on the Justice Department” or efforts to push former Vice President Mike Pence to reject some states’ electoral votes. “The volume of information has been more than I expected,” she said. Cheney praised Pence for rejecting the pressure from Trump. She said Pence, who, as vice president oversaw the session of Congress in which electoral votes were officially counted, “was a hero on January 6.”  “It’s very clear that there was tremendous pressure from a number of different places on him. And he did his duty and he didn’t succumb to that pressure and if he had succumbed to that pressure, things would have been very different,” she said. “And so I think that that we owe him gratitude for how he conducted himself and for his refusal to do what Donald Trump wanted him to do, which would have been illegal.”  Cheney faces voters on August 16  Cheney said she expects to win her primary in less than two weeks, despite her opponents attacking her role on the committee. “I don’t expect to lose."

        "content": "I’m working hard to earn every single vote and, ultimately, I really believe that the people of Wyoming fundamentally understand how important fidelity to the Constitution is; understand how important it is that we fight for those fundamental principles on which everything else is based,” she said. However, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017. “We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.” Asked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make. I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.” Cheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024. She said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not. Cheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall. Republicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan. “I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024. “I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said. Cheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him. Cheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.” “All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.” CLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.

McDaniel was joined by former White House chief of staff and onetime RNC chairman Reince Priebus, along with members of the party’s Wisconsin delegation for the announcement. “In the next two years, we look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the community to make this an event that highlights not just our nominee … but the great city that Milwaukee is,” McDaniel said. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, defended the decision to host the convention in his city, telling CNN the move “does not mean” Milwaukee is “signing up for the platform of the Republican Party.”  “My stance, and I think that most Democrats understand this, is that this is not a political decision, it is a business decision,” Johnson said. “It will present an opportunity for us to have millions of dollars of economic impact … for us to fill our restaurants, our bars, our hotels, and to support our hospitality industry that’s been battered by Covid, of course, over the last couple of years.”  Johnson joined McDaniel Friday to officially unveil Milwaukee as the convention site choice, just days after Nashville fell out of contention as a potential alternative. Milwaukee began its bid to be a convention host nearly a year ago, and city representatives met with RNC officials in February as they toured finalist cities, which included Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh at the time."

Later Friday, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha to campaign for Tim Michels, the GOP candidate for governor, ahead of the state’s primary next week. Trump’s sustained popularity with the GOP base would likely position him as a front-runner in a crowded 2024 GOP primary should he launch another presidential campaign, as is widely expected. Johnson, who said he will actively campaign for President Joe Biden’s reelection in 2024, dismissed security concerns about protests around the convention in Milwaukee, including if Trump – one of the most polarizing figures in American politics – is the Republican nominee. “I think that any time you host a large-scale event, there is potential for that sort of activity. Our police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention,” Johnson said, noting that Milwaukee was originally supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention before it switched to a virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The police in Milwaukee are already well prepared for this and will really be in a prime position to execute what we were about to execute the last go-round,” Johnson said. This story has been updated with additional reporting on the selection."

In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents. Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported."

        "content": "I would not murder my wife,” he told jurors. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents say. He found her bleeding on the floor of their cabin at Kafue National Park, he says. But federal prosecutors allege Rudolph killed his wife for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend. CNN has reached out to Rudolph’s attorney, David Markus, but has not heard back. In a motion Markus filed in January listing his client’s assets, he said Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In the court document, he noted that Rudolph is worth millions, including a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million. Life insurance companies based in Colorado paid Rudolph over $4.8 million after his wife’s death, according to court documents. The rush to cremate his wife sparked suspicion, investigators say In court documents, investigators allege Rudolph quickly sought to cremate his wife’s body in Zambia after the shooting. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents. Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. “Zambian authorities and five insurers determined that Bianca Rudolph died accidentally. Witnesses told the FBI that Dr."

        "content": "Rudolph did nothing to interfere in the investigation. No physical evidence supports the government’s murder theory,” Markus wrote in the January motion. The suspect wanted to be with his girlfriend, prosecutors allege But federal investigators say there’s more to the story. Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleges. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of the victim reached out to the FBI and asked the agency to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs in the past and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death. Rudolph’s then-girlfriend, who was not named in the court documents, worked as a manager at his dental practice near Pittsburgh, and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, Peterson wrote. The former employee told the FBI that the girlfriend told her she gave Rudolph an ultimatum of one year to sell his dental offices and leave his wife, court documents allege. Three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, the girlfriend moved in with him, Peterson wrote in court documents. An executive director of their subdivision’s community association told investigators that Rudolph and his girlfriend tried to buy another home in the same subdivision for $3.5 million. Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states. A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support. If convicted of murder, Rudolph faces a maximum of life in prison or the death penalty."

        "content": "The Atlanta music festival Music Midtown, which draws tens of thousands of concertgoers and blockbuster musicians each year, “will no longer be taking place this year,” organizers announced in a tweet Monday. Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet. The music festival was set to feature a “diverse lineup of over 30 artists across 4 stages,” including My Chemical Romance, Future, Jack White and Fall Out Boy among others, according to the festival website. “We were looking forward to reuniting in September and hope we can all get back to enjoying the festival together again soon,” the organizers said. Last year’s festival attracted some 50,000 people and featured performances by Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, and Maroon 5, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Atlanta City Council President Doug Shipman said it was a “sad day” after the cancellation was announced."

        "content": "A drug is available for monkeypox patients who have or who are at risk of severe disease, but doctors say they continue to face challenges getting access to it. The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US. Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox. It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access. However, doctors across the country suggest that significant barriers remain, causing some patients to wait days for shipments or travel to find medical centers that can provide the product at all. “Patients are trying hard to get this medication, even going out of city or out of state in some cases,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health."

        "content": "His hospital has fielded calls from patients throughout California as well as from Colorado and even Canada and the UK, all hoping to get treatment. Health agencies cut red tape, but challenges persist The CDC says doctors may want to use Tpoxx for people who have monkeypox symptoms in particularly hazardous areas like the eyes, mouth, genitals or anus. It may also be used in people with severe symptoms like sepsis or brain inflammation, or in people at high risk of severe illness, including those with weakened immune systems because of conditions like HIV/AIDS, those with skin conditions like eczema, children, pregnant women and people with other complications like a bacterial skin infection. Many people who have gotten sick during the outbreak have had mild symptoms and have recovered without treatment, but some doctors say they’ve seen more patients with severe disease than they expected. Dr. Mary Foote, medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in late July that about 20% to 25% of patients there have met the criteria for Tpoxx. As of July 23, the treatment had been prescribed for about 215 out of 839 confirmed cases. “Anecdotally, of the providers that we’ve spoken to, we’ve seen, very commonly, significant improvements within just a few days of starting and improvements in pain. And very significantly, we have not seen any significant adverse events reported and very few even mild adverse events. Some headaches, nausea. But that’s pretty much it,” Foote said. However, it’s unclear what proportion of the more than 5,000 probable or confirmed cases nationwide have been treated with Tpoxx. CDC officials said in a webinar that more than 223 people had been treated as of July 22, but the agency did not respond to requests for a more specific number. Experts say the number who’ve been treated is probably a fraction of those eligible. “I think a majority of patients don’t have access,” Chin-Hong said. He’s seen firsthand how hard it can be to get the drug. Chin-Hong treated Kevin Kwong, 34, after he developed painful lesions all over his hands, feet and face that spread to his back, thighs and scalp. “There were moments I could barely swallow food because of the sores in the back of my throat,” Kwong said. Lesions near his eye threatened to have long-term effects on his vision. But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home. But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr. Jason Zucker, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Chin-Hong says that aside from the paperwork, there’s a high “activation energy” that clinics and hospitals face because the drug is considered experimental for monkeypox and some hospitals and institutions require additional reviews for such treatments. As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center. A Pennsylvania man named Adam says it also took him several days to get access to Tpoxx. Adam had a fever, swollen lymph nodes and body aches, he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The rashes that characterize monkeypox appeared around his groin, arms, throat and face. “I would kind of liken it to a crossbreed of Covid, strep throat, mono, kind of all those things together is how monkeypox felt, in addition to the pox, which, that was an experience for sure,” he said. His doctors were concerned that one lesion under an eyelash could affect his vision. “He had a lesion on the inside of his lid, but if that would rupture, he would auto-inoculate his eye and could get a keratitis,” said Dr. Stacy Lane of the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, who treated Adam. She worried that it could put him at risk of blindness. “By the time I was initially seen and talked about the eyeball, I wasn’t put on the antiviral until almost a week later,” Adam said. In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center. The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals."

        "content": "Every region or every area will have its own problem,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York. “If you’re a private physician or your clinic doesn’t have access to Tpoxx immediately, you might have it shipped from the national stockpile, and you have to have a full process – you know, guidelines, shipping itself takes time, filling out the paperwork – so that can take a couple of days. “In New York City, you’re able to e-prescribe with certain pharmacies that would be able to make sure the appropriate paperwork is filled out to go and have that delivered in a much faster time,” he said. How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox. “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead. Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The unfortunate parallel is that the US is behind the UK and Europe in running these trials,” he said. Lane said she’s hopeful that the CDC and public health departments will continue to work toward better access to the medication. But her expectations are measured. “Until the FDA approves this for monkeypox or the National Stockpile releases the stockpile for more normal distribution, this is where we’re at,” she said."

        "content": "Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said if the Justice Department does not prosecute former President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol and “the facts and the evidence are there,” the decision could call into question whether the United States can “call ourselves a nation of laws.”  In an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt, Cheney – the GOP vice chair of the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection – said Trump is “guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history” and pointed to a judge who’s said he likely committed crimes. She said the House committee is “going to continue to follow the facts."

        "content": "I think Department of Justice will do that. But they have to make decisions about prosecution.”   “Understanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute – how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws? I think that’s a very serious, serious balancing,” Cheney said. “The question for us is, are we a nation of laws? Are we a country where no one is above the law? And what do the facts and the evidence show?” Cheney said. She sidestepped questions about whether Trump being prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department would only add to his strength with the Republican Party’s base ahead of the 2024 presidential bid that Trump has repeatedly teased. “I don’t think that it’s appropriate to think about it that way,” said Cheney, who’s facing a Trump-backed challenger in a primary later this month. She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up. The House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections. Cheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot. “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Dick Cheney adds. Liz Cheney wouldn’t say whether her father has urged her to run for president in 2024. “Look, Dick Cheney is a big Liz Cheney supporter,” she said. She said the former vice president shares “this real sadness, frankly, about what’s happening to our party, and a real despair about how it could be that so many Republicans would refuse to stand up and tell the truth.” “And it is a scary moment for the nation,” she added. Cheney says more to come from the committee this fall  Liz Cheney, who has courted Democratic voters in Wyoming’s primary, said she doesn’t see the House committee’s work through the lens of political outcomes. Cheney said the House panel will continue to lay out evidence in the coming months and that she expects the committee to “have an opinion” about making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “There’s much more that we have not yet shared in hearings and that we anticipate we will share in the fall,” she said. “And we will also make decisions about criminal referrals."

        "content": "And ultimately, the decision about prosecution’s up to the Justice Department. But I would anticipate that the committee will have an opinion on it.”  Cheney said that during the committee’s probe, she has learned that Trump’s effort to block the 2020 election results were “a more sophisticated and broader-reaching effort than I understood coming into it.”  “I think all of us on the committee have had that same reaction, which is that there’s so much, there was so much more that was happening in multiple different areas, whether it was the pressure on state officials or the pressure on the Justice Department” or efforts to push former Vice President Mike Pence to reject some states’ electoral votes. “The volume of information has been more than I expected,” she said. Cheney praised Pence for rejecting the pressure from Trump. She said Pence, who, as vice president oversaw the session of Congress in which electoral votes were officially counted, “was a hero on January 6.”  “It’s very clear that there was tremendous pressure from a number of different places on him. And he did his duty and he didn’t succumb to that pressure and if he had succumbed to that pressure, things would have been very different,” she said. “And so I think that that we owe him gratitude for how he conducted himself and for his refusal to do what Donald Trump wanted him to do, which would have been illegal.”  Cheney faces voters on August 16  Cheney said she expects to win her primary in less than two weeks, despite her opponents attacking her role on the committee. “I don’t expect to lose. I’m working hard to earn every single vote and, ultimately, I really believe that the people of Wyoming fundamentally understand how important fidelity to the Constitution is; understand how important it is that we fight for those fundamental principles on which everything else is based,” she said. However, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017. “We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.” Asked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make. I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.” Cheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024. She said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not. Cheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall. Republicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan. “I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024. “I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said. Cheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him. Cheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.” “All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.” CLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.

        "content": "Republicans will officially head to Milwaukee to select their next presidential nominee, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announced Friday, describing the host of the party’s 2024 convention as “a great city.” The convention site was unanimously approved by RNC members during a closed-door vote Friday morning at the party’s annual summer meeting here. McDaniel was joined by former White House chief of staff and onetime RNC chairman Reince Priebus, along with members of the party’s Wisconsin delegation for the announcement. “In the next two years, we look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the community to make this an event that highlights not just our nominee … but the great city that Milwaukee is,” McDaniel said. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, defended the decision to host the convention in his city, telling CNN the move “does not mean” Milwaukee is “signing up for the platform of the Republican Party.”  “My stance, and I think that most Democrats understand this, is that this is not a political decision, it is a business decision,” Johnson said. “It will present an opportunity for us to have millions of dollars of economic impact … for us to fill our restaurants, our bars, our hotels, and to support our hospitality industry that’s been battered by Covid, of course, over the last couple of years.”  Johnson joined McDaniel Friday to officially unveil Milwaukee as the convention site choice, just days after Nashville fell out of contention as a potential alternative. Milwaukee began its bid to be a convention host nearly a year ago, and city representatives met with RNC officials in February as they toured finalist cities, which included Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh at the time."

Later Friday, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha to campaign for Tim Michels, the GOP candidate for governor, ahead of the state’s primary next week. Trump’s sustained popularity with the GOP base would likely position him as a front-runner in a crowded 2024 GOP primary should he launch another presidential campaign, as is widely expected. Johnson, who said he will actively campaign for President Joe Biden’s reelection in 2024, dismissed security concerns about protests around the convention in Milwaukee, including if Trump – one of the most polarizing figures in American politics – is the Republican nominee. “I think that any time you host a large-scale event, there is potential for that sort of activity. Our police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention,” Johnson said, noting that Milwaukee was originally supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention before it switched to a virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The police in Milwaukee are already well prepared for this and will really be in a prime position to execute what we were about to execute the last go-round,” Johnson said. This story has been updated with additional reporting on the selection."

In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents. Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported."

        "content": "“I did not kill my wife. I could not murder my wife. I would not murder my wife,” he told jurors. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents say. He found her bleeding on the floor of their cabin at Kafue National Park, he says. But federal prosecutors allege Rudolph killed his wife for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend. CNN has reached out to Rudolph’s attorney, David Markus, but has not heard back. In a motion Markus filed in January listing his client’s assets, he said Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In the court document, he noted that Rudolph is worth millions, including a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million. Life insurance companies based in Colorado paid Rudolph over $4.8 million after his wife’s death, according to court documents. The rush to cremate his wife sparked suspicion, investigators say In court documents, investigators allege Rudolph quickly sought to cremate his wife’s body in Zambia after the shooting. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents. Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. “Zambian authorities and five insurers determined that Bianca Rudolph died accidentally. Witnesses told the FBI that Dr. Rudolph did nothing to interfere in the investigation. No physical evidence supports the government’s murder theory,” Markus wrote in the January motion. The suspect wanted to be with his girlfriend, prosecutors allege But federal investigators say there’s more to the story. Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleges. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of the victim reached out to the FBI and asked the agency to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs in the past and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death. Rudolph’s then-girlfriend, who was not named in the court documents, worked as a manager at his dental practice near Pittsburgh, and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, Peterson wrote. The former employee told the FBI that the girlfriend told her she gave Rudolph an ultimatum of one year to sell his dental offices and leave his wife, court documents allege. Three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, the girlfriend moved in with him, Peterson wrote in court documents. An executive director of their subdivision’s community association told investigators that Rudolph and his girlfriend tried to buy another home in the same subdivision for $3.5 million. Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states. A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support. If convicted of murder, Rudolph faces a maximum of life in prison or the death penalty."

        "content": "The Atlanta music festival Music Midtown, which draws tens of thousands of concertgoers and blockbuster musicians each year, “will no longer be taking place this year,” organizers announced in a tweet Monday. Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet. The music festival was set to feature a “diverse lineup of over 30 artists across 4 stages,” including My Chemical Romance, Future, Jack White and Fall Out Boy among others, according to the festival website. “We were looking forward to reuniting in September and hope we can all get back to enjoying the festival together again soon,” the organizers said. Last year’s festival attracted some 50,000 people and featured performances by Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, and Maroon 5, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Atlanta City Council President Doug Shipman said it was a “sad day” after the cancellation was announced."

The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US. Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox. It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access. However, doctors across the country suggest that significant barriers remain, causing some patients to wait days for shipments or travel to find medical centers that can provide the product at all. “Patients are trying hard to get this medication, even going out of city or out of state in some cases,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health."

It may also be used in people with severe symptoms like sepsis or brain inflammation, or in people at high risk of severe illness, including those with weakened immune systems because of conditions like HIV/AIDS, those with skin conditions like eczema, children, pregnant women and people with other complications like a bacterial skin infection.

        "content": "Dr. Mary Foote, medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in late July that about 20% to 25% of patients there have met the criteria for Tpoxx. As of July 23, the treatment had been prescribed for about 215 out of 839 confirmed cases. “Anecdotally, of the providers that we’ve spoken to, we’ve seen, very commonly, significant improvements within just a few days of starting and improvements in pain. And very significantly, we have not seen any significant adverse events reported and very few even mild adverse events. Some headaches, nausea. But that’s pretty much it,” Foote said. However, it’s unclear what proportion of the more than 5,000 probable or confirmed cases nationwide have been treated with Tpoxx. CDC officials said in a webinar that more than 223 people had been treated as of July 22, but the agency did not respond to requests for a more specific number. Experts say the number who’ve been treated is probably a fraction of those eligible. “I think a majority of patients don’t have access,” Chin-Hong said. He’s seen firsthand how hard it can be to get the drug. Chin-Hong treated Kevin Kwong, 34, after he developed painful lesions all over his hands, feet and face that spread to his back, thighs and scalp. “There were moments I could barely swallow food because of the sores in the back of my throat,” Kwong said. Lesions near his eye threatened to have long-term effects on his vision. But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home. But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr."

        "content": "Jason Zucker, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Chin-Hong says that aside from the paperwork, there’s a high “activation energy” that clinics and hospitals face because the drug is considered experimental for monkeypox and some hospitals and institutions require additional reviews for such treatments. As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center. A Pennsylvania man named Adam says it also took him several days to get access to Tpoxx. Adam had a fever, swollen lymph nodes and body aches, he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The rashes that characterize monkeypox appeared around his groin, arms, throat and face. “I would kind of liken it to a crossbreed of Covid, strep throat, mono, kind of all those things together is how monkeypox felt, in addition to the pox, which, that was an experience for sure,” he said. His doctors were concerned that one lesion under an eyelash could affect his vision. “He had a lesion on the inside of his lid, but if that would rupture, he would auto-inoculate his eye and could get a keratitis,” said Dr. Stacy Lane of the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, who treated Adam. She worried that it could put him at risk of blindness. “By the time I was initially seen and talked about the eyeball, I wasn’t put on the antiviral until almost a week later,” Adam said. In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center. The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals."

How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox. “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead. Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The unfortunate parallel is that the US is behind the UK and Europe in running these trials,” he said. Lane said she’s hopeful that the CDC and public health departments will continue to work toward better access to the medication. But her expectations are measured. “Until the FDA approves this for monkeypox or the National Stockpile releases the stockpile for more normal distribution, this is where we’re at,” she said."

        "content": "Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney said if the Justice Department does not prosecute former President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol and “the facts and the evidence are there,” the decision could call into question whether the United States can “call ourselves a nation of laws.”  In an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt, Cheney – the GOP vice chair of the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection – said Trump is “guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history” and pointed to a judge who’s said he likely committed crimes. She said the House committee is “going to continue to follow the facts."

        "content": "I think Department of Justice will do that. But they have to make decisions about prosecution.”   “Understanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute – how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws? I think that’s a very serious, serious balancing,” Cheney said. “The question for us is, are we a nation of laws? Are we a country where no one is above the law? And what do the facts and the evidence show?” Cheney said. She sidestepped questions about whether Trump being prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department would only add to his strength with the Republican Party’s base ahead of the 2024 presidential bid that Trump has repeatedly teased. “I don’t think that it’s appropriate to think about it that way,” said Cheney, who’s facing a Trump-backed challenger in a primary later this month. She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up. The House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections. Cheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot. “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Dick Cheney adds. Liz Cheney wouldn’t say whether her father has urged her to run for president in 2024. “Look, Dick Cheney is a big Liz Cheney supporter,” she said. She said the former vice president shares “this real sadness, frankly, about what’s happening to our party, and a real despair about how it could be that so many Republicans would refuse to stand up and tell the truth.” “And it is a scary moment for the nation,” she added. Cheney says more to come from the committee this fall  Liz Cheney, who has courted Democratic voters in Wyoming’s primary, said she doesn’t see the House committee’s work through the lens of political outcomes. Cheney said the House panel will continue to lay out evidence in the coming months and that she expects the committee to “have an opinion” about making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “There’s much more that we have not yet shared in hearings and that we anticipate we will share in the fall,” she said. “And we will also make decisions about criminal referrals."

        "content": "And ultimately, the decision about prosecution’s up to the Justice Department. But I would anticipate that the committee will have an opinion on it.”  Cheney said that during the committee’s probe, she has learned that Trump’s effort to block the 2020 election results were “a more sophisticated and broader-reaching effort than I understood coming into it.”  “I think all of us on the committee have had that same reaction, which is that there’s so much, there was so much more that was happening in multiple different areas, whether it was the pressure on state officials or the pressure on the Justice Department” or efforts to push former Vice President Mike Pence to reject some states’ electoral votes. “The volume of information has been more than I expected,” she said. Cheney praised Pence for rejecting the pressure from Trump. She said Pence, who, as vice president oversaw the session of Congress in which electoral votes were officially counted, “was a hero on January 6.”  “It’s very clear that there was tremendous pressure from a number of different places on him. And he did his duty and he didn’t succumb to that pressure and if he had succumbed to that pressure, things would have been very different,” she said. “And so I think that that we owe him gratitude for how he conducted himself and for his refusal to do what Donald Trump wanted him to do, which would have been illegal.”  Cheney faces voters on August 16  Cheney said she expects to win her primary in less than two weeks, despite her opponents attacking her role on the committee. “I don’t expect to lose."

However, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017. “We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.” Asked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make. I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.” Cheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024. She said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not. Cheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall. Republicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan. “I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024. “I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said. Cheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him. Cheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.” “All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.” CLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.

McDaniel was joined by former White House chief of staff and onetime RNC chairman Reince Priebus, along with members of the party’s Wisconsin delegation for the announcement. “In the next two years, we look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the community to make this an event that highlights not just our nominee … but the great city that Milwaukee is,” McDaniel said. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, defended the decision to host the convention in his city, telling CNN the move “does not mean” Milwaukee is “signing up for the platform of the Republican Party.”  “My stance, and I think that most Democrats understand this, is that this is not a political decision, it is a business decision,” Johnson said. “It will present an opportunity for us to have millions of dollars of economic impact … for us to fill our restaurants, our bars, our hotels, and to support our hospitality industry that’s been battered by Covid, of course, over the last couple of years.”  Johnson joined McDaniel Friday to officially unveil Milwaukee as the convention site choice, just days after Nashville fell out of contention as a potential alternative. Milwaukee began its bid to be a convention host nearly a year ago, and city representatives met with RNC officials in February as they toured finalist cities, which included Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh at the time."

Later Friday, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha to campaign for Tim Michels, the GOP candidate for governor, ahead of the state’s primary next week. Trump’s sustained popularity with the GOP base would likely position him as a front-runner in a crowded 2024 GOP primary should he launch another presidential campaign, as is widely expected. Johnson, who said he will actively campaign for President Joe Biden’s reelection in 2024, dismissed security concerns about protests around the convention in Milwaukee, including if Trump – one of the most polarizing figures in American politics – is the Republican nominee. “I think that any time you host a large-scale event, there is potential for that sort of activity. Our police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention,” Johnson said, noting that Milwaukee was originally supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention before it switched to a virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The police in Milwaukee are already well prepared for this and will really be in a prime position to execute what we were about to execute the last go-round,” Johnson said. This story has been updated with additional reporting on the selection."

In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents. Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported."

        "content": "I would not murder my wife,” he told jurors. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents say. He found her bleeding on the floor of their cabin at Kafue National Park, he says. But federal prosecutors allege Rudolph killed his wife for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend. CNN has reached out to Rudolph’s attorney, David Markus, but has not heard back. In a motion Markus filed in January listing his client’s assets, he said Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In the court document, he noted that Rudolph is worth millions, including a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million. Life insurance companies based in Colorado paid Rudolph over $4.8 million after his wife’s death, according to court documents. The rush to cremate his wife sparked suspicion, investigators say In court documents, investigators allege Rudolph quickly sought to cremate his wife’s body in Zambia after the shooting. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents. Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. “Zambian authorities and five insurers determined that Bianca Rudolph died accidentally. Witnesses told the FBI that Dr."

        "content": "Rudolph did nothing to interfere in the investigation. No physical evidence supports the government’s murder theory,” Markus wrote in the January motion. The suspect wanted to be with his girlfriend, prosecutors allege But federal investigators say there’s more to the story. Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleges. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of the victim reached out to the FBI and asked the agency to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs in the past and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death. Rudolph’s then-girlfriend, who was not named in the court documents, worked as a manager at his dental practice near Pittsburgh, and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, Peterson wrote. The former employee told the FBI that the girlfriend told her she gave Rudolph an ultimatum of one year to sell his dental offices and leave his wife, court documents allege. Three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, the girlfriend moved in with him, Peterson wrote in court documents. An executive director of their subdivision’s community association told investigators that Rudolph and his girlfriend tried to buy another home in the same subdivision for $3.5 million. Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states. A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support. If convicted of murder, Rudolph faces a maximum of life in prison or the death penalty."

        "content": "The Atlanta music festival Music Midtown, which draws tens of thousands of concertgoers and blockbuster musicians each year, “will no longer be taking place this year,” organizers announced in a tweet Monday. Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet."

        "content": "A drug is available for monkeypox patients who have or who are at risk of severe disease, but doctors say they continue to face challenges getting access to it. The US Food and Drug Administration hasn’t approved tecovirimat – sold under the brand name Tpoxx – specifically for use against monkeypox, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made the drug available from the Strategic National Stockpile through expanded access during the global outbreak that has caused about 5,800 probable or confirmed cases in the US. Tpoxx was FDA-approved in 2018 as the first drug to treat smallpox, a virus in the same family as monkeypox. The World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1980, but concerns that the virus could be weaponized drove the US government to stockpile more than 1.7 million courses of the drug in case of a bioterrorism event. Tpoxx is approved in the European Union to treat monkeypox as well as smallpox. It can be taken intravenously or more commonly as an oral pill. Tpoxx is considered experimental when it comes to monkeypox treatment because there’s no data to prove its effectiveness against the disease in humans. Its safety was assessed in healthy humans before its FDA approval for smallpox, and its effectiveness has been tested in animals infected with viruses related to smallpox, including monkeypox. As the ongoing outbreak increases demand for the drug, the FDA and CDC recently eased some of the administrative requirements that health care providers face when requesting access. However, doctors across the country suggest that significant barriers remain, causing some patients to wait days for shipments or travel to find medical centers that can provide the product at all. “Patients are trying hard to get this medication, even going out of city or out of state in some cases,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician at UCSF Health."

        "content": "His hospital has fielded calls from patients throughout California as well as from Colorado and even Canada and the UK, all hoping to get treatment. Health agencies cut red tape, but challenges persist The CDC says doctors may want to use Tpoxx for people who have monkeypox symptoms in particularly hazardous areas like the eyes, mouth, genitals or anus. It may also be used in people with severe symptoms like sepsis or brain inflammation, or in people at high risk of severe illness, including those with weakened immune systems because of conditions like HIV/AIDS, those with skin conditions like eczema, children, pregnant women and people with other complications like a bacterial skin infection. Many people who have gotten sick during the outbreak have had mild symptoms and have recovered without treatment, but some doctors say they’ve seen more patients with severe disease than they expected. Dr. Mary Foote, medical director of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in late July that about 20% to 25% of patients there have met the criteria for Tpoxx. As of July 23, the treatment had been prescribed for about 215 out of 839 confirmed cases. “Anecdotally, of the providers that we’ve spoken to, we’ve seen, very commonly, significant improvements within just a few days of starting and improvements in pain. And very significantly, we have not seen any significant adverse events reported and very few even mild adverse events. Some headaches, nausea. But that’s pretty much it,” Foote said. However, it’s unclear what proportion of the more than 5,000 probable or confirmed cases nationwide have been treated with Tpoxx. CDC officials said in a webinar that more than 223 people had been treated as of July 22, but the agency did not respond to requests for a more specific number. Experts say the number who’ve been treated is probably a fraction of those eligible. “I think a majority of patients don’t have access,” Chin-Hong said. He’s seen firsthand how hard it can be to get the drug. Chin-Hong treated Kevin Kwong, 34, after he developed painful lesions all over his hands, feet and face that spread to his back, thighs and scalp. “There were moments I could barely swallow food because of the sores in the back of my throat,” Kwong said. Lesions near his eye threatened to have long-term effects on his vision. But after his symptoms began, it took about five days for Kwong to get to a facility where he could get Tpoxx. He spent four days doing telehealth visits and going to urgent cares and emergency rooms as his rash worsened before doctors finally suspected monkeypox – and even then, he says, they didn’t know how to treat him and sent him home. But his symptoms only got worse, and he went back to the ER before being advised to go to the UCSF Medical Center because it was treating monkeypox patients. Exhausted and frustrated, he agreed out of desperation. He got there in the middle of the night; several hours later, he met Chin-Hong and took his first dose of Tpoxx. “He had to push through and get to a county that has Tpoxx and go to the emergency room in the hospital he knew might offer him therapy because the place where he comes from doesn’t have therapy,” Chin-Hong said. “If he didn’t advocate for himself, he would have never gotten Tpoxx.”  To get Tpoxx, a patient must sign a consent form from the CDC, and doctors must request access from the CDC or their local health department, which involves submitting things like lab tests and consent forms. The CDC and the FDA recently reduced the amount of paperwork needed, made certain tests and photo requirements optional, and allowed health-care workers to start treatment before paperwork is submitted. “They have made it easier, but it still requires additional time, efforts and resources to be able to prescribe it,” Dr. Jason Zucker, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Chin-Hong says that aside from the paperwork, there’s a high “activation energy” that clinics and hospitals face because the drug is considered experimental for monkeypox and some hospitals and institutions require additional reviews for such treatments. As a result, Tpoxx has been disproportionately used in larger academic medical centers that have better infrastructure for working through such processes. “We have this interesting situation – and it was like that in Covid too – where a county that doesn’t have Tpoxx will negotiate with another county and the hospital to take the patient if they are still ill and would need Tpoxx. So we may get another patient like that from another county in the East Bay today.” Chin-Hong said of the UCSF Medical Center. A Pennsylvania man named Adam says it also took him several days to get access to Tpoxx. Adam had a fever, swollen lymph nodes and body aches, he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The rashes that characterize monkeypox appeared around his groin, arms, throat and face. “I would kind of liken it to a crossbreed of Covid, strep throat, mono, kind of all those things together is how monkeypox felt, in addition to the pox, which, that was an experience for sure,” he said. His doctors were concerned that one lesion under an eyelash could affect his vision. “He had a lesion on the inside of his lid, but if that would rupture, he would auto-inoculate his eye and could get a keratitis,” said Dr. Stacy Lane of the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, who treated Adam. She worried that it could put him at risk of blindness. “By the time I was initially seen and talked about the eyeball, I wasn’t put on the antiviral until almost a week later,” Adam said. In Adam’s case, his doctor’s office didn’t have Tpoxx on hand, and after putting in the request, it took four days for it to get there from a distribution center. The Pennsylvania Department of Health said in an email that it typically takes a couple days after a doctor orders Tpoxx for it to get to a health-care provider, since the CDC must first get the product to local public health sites. “There are different processes in different states and in different hospitals."

        "content": "Every region or every area will have its own problem,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York. “If you’re a private physician or your clinic doesn’t have access to Tpoxx immediately, you might have it shipped from the national stockpile, and you have to have a full process – you know, guidelines, shipping itself takes time, filling out the paperwork – so that can take a couple of days. “In New York City, you’re able to e-prescribe with certain pharmacies that would be able to make sure the appropriate paperwork is filled out to go and have that delivered in a much faster time,” he said. How clinical trials could help Irving Medical Center’s Zucker says the process of prescribing Tpoxx involves weighing the risks and benefits for each person. Although some doctors have reported cases in which they think the drug may have been beneficial, the CDC says that evidence of how well it works in humans has been limited to “drug levels in blood” and “a few case studies.” Tpoxx’s safety was assessed through a study of 359 healthy people before it got FDA approval. Because smallpox has been eradicated since 1980, the drug’s benefits were evaluated through trials on animals that were infected with related viruses including monkeypox virus. There is no human trial data to prove that it’s effective in treating monkeypox. “Any time that we’re using a new medication, it’s important that we do randomized controlled trials because it’s really the only way to know whether it works,” Zucker said. Randomized controlled trials are studies that evaluate how well a drug works in a group of people who get the drug compared with a group of people who don’t. Zucker said he’s unsure whether such trials would be ethical in people who qualify for Tpoxx, since some of the participants would get a useless placebo instead. Dr. Jay Varma, a professor of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medical College, believes that such trials are ethical in mild cases, people who have been exposed or are at risk of exposure, and children and pregnant women. “There is a need to get high-quality data about the risks and benefits of Tpoxx,” Varma said. Zucker said trials would not only help generate much-needed data on how to use Tpoxx, they would help expand access in two ways. First, clinical data could help the drug qualify for a different type of regulatory approval that allows broader access with fewer hurdles. Second, trials could help ease access for people who don’t qualify under the current Expanded Access protocol, such as those with milder disease. “Historically, antivirals are better earlier than later, but we have to prove it,” Zucker said, adding that there are plans underway for a US monkeypox trial for Tpoxx. Varma compared the challenges of limited access and clinical data to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The unfortunate parallel is that the US is behind the UK and Europe in running these trials,” he said. Lane said she’s hopeful that the CDC and public health departments will continue to work toward better access to the medication. But her expectations are measured. “Until the FDA approves this for monkeypox or the National Stockpile releases the stockpile for more normal distribution, this is where we’re at,” she said."

Liz Cheney said if the Justice Department does not prosecute former President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection at the US Capitol and “the facts and the evidence are there,” the decision could call into question whether the United States can “call ourselves a nation of laws.”  In an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt, Cheney – the GOP vice chair of the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection – said Trump is “guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history” and pointed to a judge who’s said he likely committed crimes. She said the House committee is “going to continue to follow the facts."

        "content": "I think Department of Justice will do that. But they have to make decisions about prosecution.”   “Understanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute – how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws? I think that’s a very serious, serious balancing,” Cheney said. “The question for us is, are we a nation of laws? Are we a country where no one is above the law? And what do the facts and the evidence show?” Cheney said. She sidestepped questions about whether Trump being prosecuted by President Joe Biden’s Justice Department would only add to his strength with the Republican Party’s base ahead of the 2024 presidential bid that Trump has repeatedly teased. “I don’t think that it’s appropriate to think about it that way,” said Cheney, who’s facing a Trump-backed challenger in a primary later this month. She alluded to Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California who ordered right-wing attorney John Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, writing in March that he “finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” “I think he’s guilty of the most serious dereliction of duty of any president in our nation’s history,” Cheney said of Trump. “You’ve had a federal judge in California say that it’s more likely than not that he and John Eastman committed two crimes.” Cheney’s comments come as the House panel prepares for a busy August. A committee spokesperson also said last week that the committee intended to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department, a move that comes as the department’s criminal investigation into January 6 is heating up. The House committee is preparing to release its final report ahead of November’s midterm elections. Cheney faces a series of Trump-aligned challengers in her August 16 primary, including the Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, a former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman who has advanced conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Cheney is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney. Her reelection campaign unveiled an ad on Thursday in which the former vice president lays into Trump over his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him,” the former vice president says in the spot. “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Dick Cheney adds. Liz Cheney wouldn’t say whether her father has urged her to run for president in 2024. “Look, Dick Cheney is a big Liz Cheney supporter,” she said. She said the former vice president shares “this real sadness, frankly, about what’s happening to our party, and a real despair about how it could be that so many Republicans would refuse to stand up and tell the truth.” “And it is a scary moment for the nation,” she added. Cheney says more to come from the committee this fall  Liz Cheney, who has courted Democratic voters in Wyoming’s primary, said she doesn’t see the House committee’s work through the lens of political outcomes. Cheney said the House panel will continue to lay out evidence in the coming months and that she expects the committee to “have an opinion” about making criminal referrals to the Justice Department. “There’s much more that we have not yet shared in hearings and that we anticipate we will share in the fall,” she said. “And we will also make decisions about criminal referrals."

        "content": "And ultimately, the decision about prosecution’s up to the Justice Department. But I would anticipate that the committee will have an opinion on it.”  Cheney said that during the committee’s probe, she has learned that Trump’s effort to block the 2020 election results were “a more sophisticated and broader-reaching effort than I understood coming into it.”  “I think all of us on the committee have had that same reaction, which is that there’s so much, there was so much more that was happening in multiple different areas, whether it was the pressure on state officials or the pressure on the Justice Department” or efforts to push former Vice President Mike Pence to reject some states’ electoral votes. “The volume of information has been more than I expected,” she said. Cheney praised Pence for rejecting the pressure from Trump. She said Pence, who, as vice president oversaw the session of Congress in which electoral votes were officially counted, “was a hero on January 6.”  “It’s very clear that there was tremendous pressure from a number of different places on him. And he did his duty and he didn’t succumb to that pressure and if he had succumbed to that pressure, things would have been very different,” she said. “And so I think that that we owe him gratitude for how he conducted himself and for his refusal to do what Donald Trump wanted him to do, which would have been illegal.”  Cheney faces voters on August 16  Cheney said she expects to win her primary in less than two weeks, despite her opponents attacking her role on the committee. “I don’t expect to lose. I’m working hard to earn every single vote and, ultimately, I really believe that the people of Wyoming fundamentally understand how important fidelity to the Constitution is; understand how important it is that we fight for those fundamental principles on which everything else is based,” she said. However, the congresswoman also made clear that she is not tempering her criticism of Trump at all – even if it costs her the House seat that her father held and that she has held since 2017. “We’re in a situation where former President Trump has betrayed the patriotism of millions and millions of people across our country, and many people here in Wyoming, and he’s lied to them,” she said. “And what I know to do is to tell the truth, and to make sure that people understand the truth about what happened and why it matters so much.” Asked why she thinks voters believe Trump, Cheney added: “It’s just consistent lying about what happened about the election, playing on people’s patriotism. And he’s so dangerous that, you know, my view is that at the end of the day, if defending the Constitution against the threat that he poses means losing a House seat, then that’s a sacrifice that I’m willing to make. I don’t intend to lose. But some things are more important than any individual office or political campaign.” Cheney would not discuss her political plans after this month’s primary. But she said she will do “whatever is necessary” to keep Trump from becoming the GOP presidential nominee for a third consecutive election in 2024. She said she intends to be “a big part of making sure that we protect the nation” from Trump, whether she wins reelection or not. Cheney also urged members of both parties to band against GOP candidates who have advanced Trump’s lies about election fraud and are seeking to take over the election machinery of key states this fall. Republicans in recent months have nominated candidates who have embraced Trump’s lies about election fraud for offices that control the election machinery in a series of states, including some of the nation’s most competitive presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. The party has also endorsed an election denier for the top elections post in Michigan. “I don’t think anybody should vote for any election denier,” Cheney said. She cast defeating those candidates as critical to stopping Trump from circumventing the will of American voters if he is nominated for president in 2024. “I think we have to make sure that we come together and form alliances across party lines, to make sure that the people that we are electing are not going to unravel the republic,” she said. Cheney lambasted Democrats for meddling in GOP primaries to boost election deniers that they think will be less viable general election candidates, as was the case in the primary defeat this week of Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump following the insurrection. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pumped more than $300,000 into television ads to boost Trump-endorsed John Gibbs against him. Cheney said Democrats’ involvement in the race was “terrible.” “All of us, again, across party lines, have got to make sure that we are supporting people who believe fundamentally in our democratic system,” she said. “And so I think that it’s inexplicable and wrong for the Democrats to be funding election deniers, particularly against one of the 10 Republicans who so bravely stood up and did the right thing.” CLARIFICATION: This headline and story have been updated to clarify the conditions that Cheney thinks would call into question the US as a “nation of laws” and to include additional information from the interview.

        "content": "Republicans will officially head to Milwaukee to select their next presidential nominee, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announced Friday, describing the host of the party’s 2024 convention as “a great city.” The convention site was unanimously approved by RNC members during a closed-door vote Friday morning at the party’s annual summer meeting here. McDaniel was joined by former White House chief of staff and onetime RNC chairman Reince Priebus, along with members of the party’s Wisconsin delegation for the announcement. “In the next two years, we look forward to working with the mayor and everyone in the community to make this an event that highlights not just our nominee … but the great city that Milwaukee is,” McDaniel said. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, a Democrat, defended the decision to host the convention in his city, telling CNN the move “does not mean” Milwaukee is “signing up for the platform of the Republican Party.”  “My stance, and I think that most Democrats understand this, is that this is not a political decision, it is a business decision,” Johnson said. “It will present an opportunity for us to have millions of dollars of economic impact … for us to fill our restaurants, our bars, our hotels, and to support our hospitality industry that’s been battered by Covid, of course, over the last couple of years.”  Johnson joined McDaniel Friday to officially unveil Milwaukee as the convention site choice, just days after Nashville fell out of contention as a potential alternative. Milwaukee began its bid to be a convention host nearly a year ago, and city representatives met with RNC officials in February as they toured finalist cities, which included Salt Lake City and Pittsburgh at the time."

Later Friday, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a rally in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha to campaign for Tim Michels, the GOP candidate for governor, ahead of the state’s primary next week. Trump’s sustained popularity with the GOP base would likely position him as a front-runner in a crowded 2024 GOP primary should he launch another presidential campaign, as is widely expected. Johnson, who said he will actively campaign for President Joe Biden’s reelection in 2024, dismissed security concerns about protests around the convention in Milwaukee, including if Trump – one of the most polarizing figures in American politics – is the Republican nominee. “I think that any time you host a large-scale event, there is potential for that sort of activity. Our police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention,” Johnson said, noting that Milwaukee was originally supposed to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention before it switched to a virtual format amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The police in Milwaukee are already well prepared for this and will really be in a prime position to execute what we were about to execute the last go-round,” Johnson said. This story has been updated with additional reporting on the selection."

In late September 2016, the couple traveled from their Phoenix home to the southern African nation of Zambia, where Bianca Rudolph was determined to add a leopard to her collection of animal trophies. They carried two guns for the hunt: a Remington .375 rifle and a Browning 12-gauge shotgun. After killing other animals during the two-week trip – but not a leopard – Bianca Rudolph never made it home. She suffered a fatal shotgun blast in their hunting cabin at dawn as she was packing to return to Phoenix, federal prosecutors allege in court documents. Now Lawrence Rudolph, 67, is charged with foreign murder and mail fraud in the death of his wife of 30 years. He has pleaded not guilty, and took the stand in his own defense this week at his trial in Denver, CNN affiliate KMGH reported."

        "content": "I would not murder my wife,” he told jurors. Rudolph told investigators he heard the shot while he was in the bathroom and believed the shotgun accidentally went off as she was putting it in its case, court documents say. He found her bleeding on the floor of their cabin at Kafue National Park, he says. But federal prosecutors allege Rudolph killed his wife for insurance money and to be with his girlfriend. CNN has reached out to Rudolph’s attorney, David Markus, but has not heard back. In a motion Markus filed in January listing his client’s assets, he said Rudolph had no financial motive to kill his wife. In the court document, he noted that Rudolph is worth millions, including a dental practice near Pittsburgh valued at $10 million. Life insurance companies based in Colorado paid Rudolph over $4.8 million after his wife’s death, according to court documents. The rush to cremate his wife sparked suspicion, investigators say In court documents, investigators allege Rudolph quickly sought to cremate his wife’s body in Zambia after the shooting. Rudolph scheduled a cremation three days after her death, according to court documents. After he reported her death to the US Embassy in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, the consular chief “told the FBI he had a bad feeling about the situation, which he thought was moving too quickly,” FBI special agent Donald Peterson wrote in the criminal affidavit. As a result, the consular chief and two other embassy officials went to the funeral home where the body was being held to take photographs and preserve any potential evidence. When Rudolph found out the embassy officials had taken photos of his wife’s body, he was “livid,” Peterson wrote. Rudolph initially told the consular chief that his wife may have died by suicide, but an investigation by Zambian law enforcement ruled it an accidental discharge, Peterson wrote. Zambian investigators concluded that the firearm was loaded from the previous hunting activities and normal safety precautions were not taken, causing it to accidentally fire in the fatal incident, according to court documents. Investigators for the insurers reached a similar conclusion and paid on the policies. “Zambian authorities and five insurers determined that Bianca Rudolph died accidentally. Witnesses told the FBI that Dr."

        "content": "Rudolph did nothing to interfere in the investigation. No physical evidence supports the government’s murder theory,” Markus wrote in the January motion. The suspect wanted to be with his girlfriend, prosecutors allege But federal investigators say there’s more to the story. Rudolph orchestrated his wife’s death as part of a scheme to defraud life insurance companies and to allow him to live openly with his girlfriend, the FBI alleges. Federal authorities got involved after a friend of the victim reached out to the FBI and asked the agency to investigate the death because she suspected foul play. The friend said Rudolph had been involved in extramarital affairs in the past and had a girlfriend at the time of his wife’s death. Rudolph’s then-girlfriend, who was not named in the court documents, worked as a manager at his dental practice near Pittsburgh, and told a former employee that she’d been dating him for 15 to 20 years, Peterson wrote. The former employee told the FBI that the girlfriend told her she gave Rudolph an ultimatum of one year to sell his dental offices and leave his wife, court documents allege. Three months after Bianca Rudolph’s death, the girlfriend moved in with him, Peterson wrote in court documents. An executive director of their subdivision’s community association told investigators that Rudolph and his girlfriend tried to buy another home in the same subdivision for $3.5 million. Her wounds didn’t reflect an accidental discharge, FBI says Court documents also allege that evidence shows Bianca Rudolph’s wounds came from a shot fired from at least two feet away. “An FBI special agent conducted testing to determine, by comparison to photographs from the scene of the death, the approximate position of the shotgun muzzle within the soft case at the time of discharge, as well as the resulting shot patterns created by firing the shotgun with the case over the barrel at various distances,” the criminal complaint states. A forensic medical examiner determined the patterns matching the wound observed in photographs of the body were created by a shot from a distance of between two and three-and-a-half feet. “At that distance, there is reason to believe that Bianca Rudolph was not killed by an accidental discharge as stated,” the complaint states. Bianca and Lawrence Rudolph moved from Pennsylvania to Arizona about four years before her death. Rudolph’s dental practice remained in Pennsylvania, and he commuted back and forth from his Phoenix home. Federal authorities allege his wife’s murder was premeditated so “he could falsely claim the death was the result of an accident.” But Markus has accused federal officials of relying on “shaky evidence.” Rudolph’s two children are confident their father did not kill their mother, Markus said, and they’ve signed affidavits in his support. If convicted of murder, Rudolph faces a maximum of life in prison or the death penalty."

        "content": "The Atlanta music festival Music Midtown, which draws tens of thousands of concertgoers and blockbuster musicians each year, “will no longer be taking place this year,” organizers announced in a tweet Monday. Though the organizers did not cite a reason for calling off the festival, various media reports citing industry and festival sources said the cancellation was due to a recent interpretation of Georgia’s gun law, which permits firearms in public spaces, including parks. Weapons and explosives of any kind are prohibited at the festival, according to its website. Gun rights advocates had mounted a pressure campaign against that position, calling into question the festival’s ability to restrict firearms since Georgia allows guns to be carried in parks. Sources with knowledge of the cancellation decision by operator Live Nation who spoke to Rolling Stone cited Georgia gun laws as the reason. Georgia gun advocate Phil Evans told CNN he emailed festival organizers in May, apprising them of Georgia gun laws and a Georgia Supreme Court case dealing with guns in which he was a party. Evans said he also asked the City of Atlanta to deny a permit to Live Nation for Music Midtown, given the festival’s ban on firearms. In the email dated May 13, Evans asked the city to deny the permit for “as they have publicly stated an intent to violate settled state law.” “The City of Atlanta should respect state law and uphold it when dealing with entities that make use of tax-payer owned properties that wish to make money from such usage, or even otherwise,” the email said. The event slated for September 17 and 18 in Piedmont Park was canceled “due to circumstances beyond our control,” said the organizer’s tweet. The music festival was set to feature a “diverse lineup of over 30 artists across 4 stages,” including My Chemical Romance, Future, Jack White and Fall Out Boy among others, according to the festival website. “We were looking forward to reuniting in September and hope we can all get back to enjoying the festival together again soon,” the organizers said. Last year’s festival attracted some 50,000 people and featured performances by Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, and Maroon 5, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Atlanta City Council President Doug Shipman said it was a “sad day” after the cancellation was announced."
