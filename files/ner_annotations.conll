a O
“vote-a-rama O

A O

on O
final O

the O

take O
place O
when O

end O
, O
the O
timing O

it O
is O
not O
yet O
clear O
. O
The O
bill O
– O
named O
the O
Inflation O
Reduction O
Act O
– O
would O
represent O
the O
largest O
climate O
investment O
in O
US B-LOC
history O
and O
make O
major O
changes O
to O
health O
policy O
by O
giving O
Medicare O
the O
power O
for O
the O
first O
time O
to O
negotiate O
the O
prices O
of O
certain O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
extending O
expiring O
health O
care O
subsidies O
for O
three O
years O
. O
The O
legislation O
would O
impose O
new O
taxes O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O
The O
package O
is O
the O
product O
of O
painstaking O
negotiations O
and O
will O
give O
Democrats O
a O
chance O
to O
achieve O
major O
policy O
objectives O
ahead O
of O
the O
upcoming O
midterm O
elections O
. O
Senate O
Democrats O
are O
using O
a O
special O
process O
to O
pass O
the O
package O
without O
Republican O
votes O
. O
Once O
the O
legislation O
has O
passed O
in O
the O
Senate O
, O
it O
would O
next O
need O
to O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
before O
President B-PER
Joe I-PER
Biden I-PER
could O
sign O
it O

What O
happens O
next O
Following O
the O
procedural O
vote O
to O
proceed O
to O
the O
bill O
, O
the O
Senate O
entered O
debate O
before O
moving O
into O
the O
“vote-a-rama O
.” O
The O
marathon O
series O
of O
amendment O
votes O
with O
no O
time O
limit O
must O
run O
its O
course O
before O
a O
final O
vote O
can O
take O
place O
. O
Republicans O
are O
using O
the O
“vote-a-rama O
” O
to O
put O
Democrats O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
force O
politically O
tough O
votes O
, O
and O
votes O
on O
contentious O
policy O
issues O
are O
expected O
. O
As O
expected O
, O
key O
insulin O
provisions O
were O
struck O
out O
of O
the O
bill O
after O
Republicans O
raised O
a O
point O
of O
order O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
vote O
to O
strip O
them O
out O
. O
The O
final O
vote O
was O
57-43 O
. O
A O
60-vote O
threshold O
was O
needed O
to O
keep O
the O
provision O
in O
place O
. O
The O
provisions O
initially O
included O
in O
the O
bill O
would O
have O
limited O
insulin O
prices O
to O
$35 O
per O
month O
in O
both O
the O
private O
insurance O
market O
as O
well O
as O
through O
Medicare O
. O
But O
the O
Senate O
parliamentarian O
ruled O
that O
the O
cap O
on O
insulin O
in O
the O
private O
insurance O
market O
was O
not O
compliant O
with O
the O
reconciliation O
rules O
Democrats O
are O
utilizing O
to O
push O
their O
legislation O
through O
the O
chamber O
. O
Democrats O
kept O
both O
provisions O
in O
the O
bill O
anyway O
, O
but O
Republicans O
raised O
a O
point O
of O
order O
to O
force O
a O
vote O
to O
strike O
the O
provisions O
only O
from O
the O
private O
marketplace O
. O
The O
Medicare O
$35 O
insulin O
cap O
remains O
in O
place O
. O
The O
House O
is O
poised O
to O
come O
back O
to O
take O
up O
the O
legislation O
on O
Friday O

How O
Democrats O
plan O
to O
pass O
the O
sweeping O
legislation O
Senate O
Democrats O
only O
need O
a O
simple O
majority O
for O
final O
passage O
of O
the O
bill O
since O
they O
are O
using O
a O
process O
known O
as O
reconciliation O
, O
which O
allows O
them O
to O
avoid O
a O
Republican O
filibuster O
and O
corresponding O
60-vote O
threshold O
. O
In O
order O
to O
pass O
a O
bill O
through O
the O
reconciliation O
process O
, O
however O
, O
the O
package O
must O
comply O
with O
a O
strict O
set O
of O
budget O
rules O
. O
The O
Senate O
parliamentarian O
has O
to O
decide O
whether O
the O
provisions O
in O
the O
bill O
meet O
the O
rules O
to O
allow O
Democrats O
to O
use O
the O
filibuster-proof O
budget O
process O
to O
pass O
the O
legislation O
along O
straight O
party O
lines O
. O
Senate O
Majority O
Leader O
Chuck B-PER
Schumer I-PER
announced O
Saturday O
that O
after O
undergoing O
the O
parliamentarian’s O
review O
, O
the O

“remains O

“The O

the O
New O

said O
. O
In O
a O
key O
ruling O
, O
the O
parliamentarian O
, O
Elizabeth B-PER
MacDonough I-PER
, O
allowed O
a O
major O
component O
of O
the O
Democrats’ O
prescription O
drug O
pricing O
plans O
to O
move O
ahead O
– O
giving O
Medicare O
the O
power O
to O
negotiate O
the O
prices O
of O
certain O
prescription O
drugs O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
But O
MacDonough O
narrowed O
another O
provision O
aimed O
at O
lowering O
drug O
prices O
– O
imposing O
penalties O
on O
drug O
companies O
if O
they O
increase O
their O
prices O
faster O
than O
inflation O
. O
Democrats O
had O
wanted O
the O
measure O
to O
apply O
both O
to O
Medicare O
and O
the O
private O
insurance O
market O
. O
But O
the O
parliamentarian O
ruled O
the O
inflation O
cap O
could O
only O
apply O
to O
Medicare O
, O
a O
Democratic O
aide O
said O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
MacDonough O
ruled O
to O
keep O
intact O
several O
climate O
measures O
from O
the O
Environment O
and O
Public O
Works O
Committee O
in O
the O
reconciliation O

including O
a O

Earlier O
Saturday O

Ron B-PER

that O
the O

How O
the O
bill O
addresses O
the O
climate O
crisis O
For O
a O
party O
that O
failed O
to O
pass O
major O
climate O
legislation O
over O
10 O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
reconciliation O
bill O
represents O
a O
major O
, O
long-fought O
victory O
for O
Democrats O
. O
The O
nearly O
$370 O
billion O
clean O
energy O
and O
climate O
package O
is O
the O
largest O
climate O
investment O
in O
US B-LOC
history O
, O
and O
the O
biggest O
victory O
for O
the O
environmental O
movement O
since O
the O
landmark O
Clean O
Air O
Act O
. O
It O
also O
comes O
at O
a O
critical O
time O
; O
this O
summer O
has O
seen O
punishing O

deadly O
floods O
across O
the O

which O

say O
are O
both O
linked O

Analysis O
from O
Schumer’s O
office O
– O
as O
well O
as O
multiple O
independent O
analyses O
– O
suggests O
the O
measures O
would O
reduce O
US B-LOC
carbon O
emissions O
by O
up O
to O
40% O
by O
2030 O
. O
Strong O
climate O
regulations O
from O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration O
and O
action O
from O

would O
be O
needed O
to O
get O
to O
Biden’s O
goal O
of O
cutting O
emissions O
50% O
by O
2030 O
. O
The O
bill O
also O
contains O
many O
tax O
incentives O
meant O
to O
bring O
down O
the O
cost O
of O
electricity O
with O
more O
renewables O

and O
spur O
more O
American B-MISC
consumers O
to O
switch O
to O
electricity O
to O
power O
their O
homes O
and O

. O
Lawmakers O
said O
the O
bill O
represents O
a O
monumental O
victory O
and O
is O
also O
just O
the O
start O
of O
what O
’s O
needed O
to O
combat O
the O
climate O
crisis O
. O
“This O
isn’t O
about O

this O

Key O
health O

tax O
policy O
in O
the O

The O
bill O

offices O

another O
15 O
drugs O
in O

again O

The O
number O
would O
rise O
to O
20 O
drugs O
a O
year O
for O

beyond O
. O
This O
controversial O
provision O
is O
far O
more O
limited O
than O
the O
one O
House O
Democratic O
leaders O
have O
backed O
in O
the O
past O
. O
But O
it O
would O
open O
the O
door O
to O
fulfilling O
a O
longstanding O
party O
goal O
of O
allowing O
Medicare O
to O
use O
its O
heft O
to O
lower O

costs O

are O
also O
planning O
to O
extend O
the O
enhanced O

coverage O
through O
2025 O

a O
year O
later O

recently O
discussed O

That O
way O
they O
wouldn’t O
expire O
just O
after O
the O
2024 O
presidential O
election O
. O
To O
boost O
revenue O
, O
the O
bill O
would O
impose O
a O
15% O
minimum O
tax O

The O
measure O
, O
which O
would O
raise O

how O

, O
Sinema O
nixed O
her O
party’s O
effort O

rate O
instead O
of O
income O

up O

President O

“Victory O

Last O
week, O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
took O
a O
victory O
lap O
when O
he O
announced O
that O
the O
US O

and O
killed O
its O
most O

terrorist, O
al B-MISC

on O
August O

the O
first O

of O
the O
US O
troop O
withdrawal O

which O
ended O
the O

Any O
realistic O
assessment O
of O
that O
action O
shows O
that O
it O
will O
long O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
defeat O
rather O

a O
victory O
– O
and O
it’s O
likely O
no O
one O
will O
own O
up O
to O
the O
responsibility O
for O
the O
decision. O
The O
US O
launched O
a O
war O
against O
Afghanistan B-LOC
in O
2001 O
after O
the O
Taliban O
regime O
harbored O
Osama B-PER

giving O
him O
the O
ability O
to O
plot O
and O
carry O
out O
the O
9/11 O

attacks O
which O
killed O
almost O
3,000 O
Americans. O
As O
US O
and O
NATO B-ORG
troops O
battled O
Taliban O
and O
al B-MISC
Qaeda I-MISC
forces, O
the O
new O
US-backed O
government O
in O
Kabul B-LOC
also O
presided O
over O
two O
decades O
of O
progress O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O
To O
be O
sure, O
Afghanistan B-LOC
wasn’t O
Norway, O
but O
it O
was O
becoming O
a O
somewhat O
functional, O
democratizing O
Central O
Asian O
state O
that O
saw O
striking O
progress O
in O
reducing O
child O

one O
that O
provided O
jobs O
for O
women O

for O
millions O

it O
nurtured O
scores O
of O
independent O

held O
regular, O

flawed, O
presidential O

All O
of O
that O
changed O
when O

began O

Women’s O
rights O
evaporated. O
They O
have O
no O
right O

in O
a O
narrow O
set O
of O
female-related O
jobs O
such O
as O
cleaning O

in O
Kabul B-LOC

when O
they O
travel O
distances O
of O
more O
than O
45 O

they O
must O
be O
accompanied O
by O
a O
male O

the O

ordered O
women O
to O
stay O
at O

to O
cover O
themselves O
completely O
should O

Their O

On O
the O
Taliban’s O
management O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
one O
data O
point O
suffices O
to O
underline O
the O
group’s O
gross O
incompetence: O
Around O
half O
of O
the O
Afghan O
population O
are O
today O
“facing O
acute O
hunger,” O
according O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O
On O
the O
Taliban’s O
respect O
for O
other O
ethnic O
Afghan O
groups: O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
Taliban O
are O
creating O
an O
“inclusive” O
government O
as O
their O
leaders O
claimed O
they O
would. O
Pashtuns O
make O
up O
almost O
all O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Taliban O
, O
while O
other O
ethnic O
groups O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
such O
as O
the O
Hazaras, O
Tajiks O
and O
Uzbeks O
are O
almost O
entirely O
excluded O
from O
leadership O
roles. O
On O
their O
respect O
for O
democracy: O
The O
Taliban O
, O
conveniently, O
don’t O
believe O
in O
elections. O
Instead, O
they O
are O
a O
theocracy; O
their O
leader O
is O
known O
as O
the O
“Commander O
of O
the O
Faithful,” O
a O
title O
that O
claims O
he O
is O
the O
leader O
of O
all O
Muslims. O
In O
the O
past O
year O
under O
Taliban O
rule, O
40% O
of O
Afghanistan’s O
independent O
media O
outlets O
have O
closed. O
On O
the O
Taliban’s O
alliance O
with O
al B-MISC
Qaeda I-MISC
: O
Well, O
last O
week’s O
news O
made O
clear O
the O
relationship O
is O
thriving. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
leader O
of O
al B-MISC
Qaeda I-MISC
, O
Ayman B-PER
al-Zawahiri I-PER
was O
living O
in O
downtown O
Kabul B-LOC
for O
months O
– O
with O
what O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration I-PER
describes O
as O
the O
awareness O
of O
some O
Taliban O
officials O
– O
speaks O
for O
itself. O
Zawahiri O
was O
killed O
late O
last O
month O
in O
a O
US O
drone O
strike O
. O
After O
the O
news O
broke O
that O
Zawahiri O
had O
been O
hiding O
in O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
Lisa B-PER
Curtis I-PER
, O
the O
top O
official O
at O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
for O
Afghanistan B-LOC
during O
the O
Trump B-PER
administration I-PER
, O
tweeted O
“#Taliban O
basically O
asserting O
Doha O
agreement O
allows O
them O
to O
shelter O
#AlQaeda. O
Proves O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
agreement O
in O
US O
history. O
Not O
worth O
the O
paper O
on O
which O
it’s O
written.” O
This O
was O
a O
particularly O
damning O
assessment O
coming O
from O
a O
senior O
American O
official O
who O
was O
working O
on O
Afghanistan B-LOC
while O
the O
Doha O
agreement O
between O
the O
US O
and O
the O
Taliban O
was O
being O
negotiated. O
One O
of O
the O
most O
powerful O
men O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
today O
is O
the O
acting O
Minister O
of O
Interior, O
Sirajuddin B-PER
Haqqani I-PER
, O
who O
has O
ties O
to O
al B-MISC
Qaeda I-MISC
, O
according O
to O
a O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
report O
that O
said O
he O
is O
“assessed O
to O
be O
a O
member O
of O
the O
wider O
Al-Qaida B-MISC
leadership, O
but O
not O
of O
the O
Al-Qaida B-MISC
core O
leadership.” O
A O
February O
2020 O
opinion O
piece O
in O
The B-ORG

with O
Haqqani’s O
byline O
blandly O
identified O
him O
only O
as O
“the O
deputy O
leader O
of O
the O
Taliban.” O
What O
the O
Times I-ORG
didn’t O
tell O
its O
readers O
is O
that O
Haqqani O
was O
also O
on O
the O

wanted O
list O
and O
that O
his O
men O
had O
kidnapped O
a O
reporter O
for O
… O
The B-ORG

Times I-ORG
. O
This O
op-ed O
featured O
ludicrous O
lies O
including, O
“We O
together O
will O
find O
a O
way O
to O
build O
an O
Islamic O
system O
in O
which O
all O
Afghans O
have O
equal O
rights, O
where O
the O
rights O
of O

that O
are O
granted O
by O

– O
from O
the O
right O
to O

to O

” O
and O
“reports O

are O
politically O
motivated O
exaggerations O
by O
the O
warmongering O
players O
on O
all O
sides O
of O
the O
war.” O
How O
it O
happened O
The O
US O
pullout O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
a O
year O
ago O
was O
orchestrated O
by O
a O
successive O
series O
of O
decisions O
by O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
, O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
and O
the O
chief O
US O
negotiator O
with O
the O
Taliban O
, O
Ambassador O
Zalmay B-PER
Khalilzad I-PER
. O
None O
of O
these O
men O
are O
ever O
likely O
to O
fully O
acknowledge O
their O
paternity O
of O
the O
debacle O
that O
unfolded O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
which O
followed O
the O
worst O
diplomatic O
agreement O
in O
US O
history O
that O
enabled O
the O
Taliban O
to O
win O
at O
the O
negotiating O
table O
in O
Doha B-LOC
, O
Qatar B-LOC
what O
they O
could O
never O
win O
on O
the O
battlefield. O
Khalilzad O
has O
defended O
the O
deal O
saying, O
“The O
negotiation O
was O
a O
result O
of–based O
on O
the O
judgment O
that O
we O
weren’t O
winning O
the O
war O
and O
therefore O
time O
was O
not O
on O
our O
side O
and O
better O
to O
make O
a O
deal O
sooner O
than O
later.” O
By O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Trump B-PER
administration I-PER
, O
the O
fledgling O
Afghan O
state O
was O
supported O
by O
only O
some O
2,500 O
US O
troops, O
a O
tiny O
fraction O
of O
the O
more O
than O
two O
million O
men O
and O
women O
in O
the O
active-duty O
US O
military, O
reserves, O
and O
National O
Guard O
units. O
Assisted O
by O
9,000 O
allied, O
mostly O
NATO B-ORG
troops O
and O
18,000 O
contractors O
this O
small O
US O
force O
was O
enough O
to O
enable O
the O
Afghan O
military O
to O
fend O
off O
the O
Taliban O
, O
which O
was O
never O
able O
to O
capture O
and O
hold O
any O
of O
Afghanistan’s O
34 O
provincial O
capitals O
before O
Biden B-PER
announced O
the O
total O
American O
withdrawal O
in O
April O
2021 O
. O
Why O
Biden B-PER
went O
through O
with O
the O
withdrawal O
plan O
that O
he O
had O
inherited O
from O
Trump B-PER
is O
still O
something O
of O
a O
puzzle O
since O
there O
was O
no O
large, O
vocal O
constituency O
in O
the O
Democratic O
Party O
that O
was O
demanding O
a O
total O
US O
pullout O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
and O
Biden’s O
top O
military O
advisers O
had O
clearly O
warned O
him O
of O
the O
risks O
of O
doing O
so. O
In O
public O
testimony O
before O
the O
US O
Senate O
Armed O
Services O
Committee, O
US O
Chairman O
of O
the O
Joint O
Chiefs O
of O
Staff O
Gen. O
Mark B-PER
Milley I-PER
and O
US O
CENTCOM O
commander O
Gen. O
Kenneth B-PER
McKenzie I-PER
, O
said O
they O
had O
advised O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration I-PER
that O
unless O
the O
US O
kept O
around O
2,500 O
troops O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Afghan O
military O
would O
collapse. O
Collapse O
it O
did. O
The O
“Taliban O
2.0” O
delusion O
The O
publication O
of O
Haqqani’s O
op-ed O
in O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
was O
emblematic O
of O
the O
wishful O
thinking O
about O
the O
Taliban O
in O
the O
US O
that O
had O
persisted O
for O
years. O
In O
this O
view O
the O
Taliban O
were O
just O
a O
bunch O
of O
misunderstood O
backwoodsmen O
who O
would O
eventually O
do O
what O
was O
only O
sensible: O
break O
with O
al B-MISC
Qaeda I-MISC
and O
abandon O
much O
of O
their O
misogynistic O
ideology O
as O
a O
quid O
pro O
quo O
for O
their O
recognition O
on O
the O
world O
stage. O
This O
was O
a O
classic O
case O
of O
mirror O
imaging; O
the O
belief O
that O
the O
Taliban O
would O
do O
the O
rational O
things O
some O
gullible O
Americans O
expected O
them O
to O
do, O
as O
opposed O
to O
implementing O
the O
quasi-mediaeval O
ideology O
that O
has O
been O
at O
the O
core O
of O
their O
armed O
movement O
since O
they O
first O
emerged O
almost O
three O
decades O
ago. O
It O
was O
like O
imagining O
the O
Khmer O
Rouge O
would O
“mature” O
once O
they O
had O
taken O
power O
in O
Cambodia O
. O
A O
key O
proponent O
of O
the O
view O
that O
the O
Taliban O
would O
change O
if O
the O
right O
carrots O
were O
dangled O
in O
front O
of O
them O
was O
Barnett B-PER
Rubin I-PER
of O
NYU O
, O
an O
expert O
on O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
who O
claimed O
in O
a O
paper O
that O
he O
published O
with O
the O
United B-ORG
States I-ORG
Institute O
of O
Peace O
in O
March O
2021 O
that O
the O
US O
had O
“underestimated O
the O
leverage O
that O
the O
Taliban O
’s O
quest O
for O
sanctions O
relief, O
recognition O
and O
international O
assistance O
provides.” O
Turns O
out O
that O
it O
was O
Rubin O
who O
overestimated O
how O
much O
the O
Taliban O
cared O
about O
sanctions O
relief O
and O
international O
assistance, O
while O
he O
had O
also O
vastly O
underestimated O
their O
desire O
to O
banish O
women O
from O
jobs O
and O
education O
and O
maintain O
their O
warm O
relations O
with O
their O
old O
buddies O
in O
al B-MISC
Qaeda I-MISC
. O
This O
shouldn’t O
have O
come O
as O
much O
of O
a O
surprise, O
since O
that O
was O
exactly O
how O
the O
Taliban O
had O
ruled O
the O
last O
time O
that O
they O
were O
in O
power O
in O
the O
years O
before O
9/11 O
. O
The O
Taliban O
hadn’t O
fought O
the O
US O
and O
Afghan O
militaries O
for O
two O
decades O
only O
to O
install O
a O
quasi-democracy O
when O
they O
came O
to O
power O
for O
the O
second O
time O
. O
The O
“moderate” O
Taliban O
2.0 O
that O
was O
supposedly O
emerging O
in O
recent O
years O
was O
a O
profound O
delusion O
that O
gripped O
US O
policymakers O
. O
A O
month O
after O
Biden B-PER
had O
announced O
the O
impending O
withdrawal O
of O
all O
US O
troops O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC

the O
US O

House O

on O

, O
that O
those O
who O
thought O
the O
Taliban O
would O
quickly O
take O
over O
the O
country O
as O
the O
US O
pulled O
out O
were O
“mistaken.” O
Khalilzad O
also O
asserted O
that O
the O
Taliban O
would O
opt O
for O
a O
political O
settlement O
over O
a O
military O
victory, O
testifying, O
“They O
say O
they O
seek O
normalcy O
in O
terms O
of O
relations O
— O
acceptability, O
removal O
from O
sanctions, O
not O
to O
remain O
a O
pariah.” O
Just O
months O
later O
the O
distinctive O
white O
flags O
of O
the O
Taliban O
were O
fluttering O
over O
the O
capital, O
Kabul B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
Taliban O
began O
implementing O
their O
theocratic O
state O
. O
In O
a O
symbolic O
move O
the O
Taliban’s O
feared O
religious O
police O
soon O
commandeered O
what O
had O
formerly O
been O
the O
ministry O
for O
women’s O
affairs O
. O
Obviously, O
that O
ministry O
would O
no O
longer O
be O
needed, O
but O
the O
“Vice O
and O
Virtue O
” O
police O
would O
have O
to O
be O
properly O
accommodated O
. O
The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
released O
a O
report O
in O
May O
in O
which O
it O
observed O
that O
an O
astonishing O
41 O
members O
of O
the O
Taliban O
serving O
in O
the O
cabinet O
or O
other O
senior-level O
government O
positions O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
are O
on O
UN O
sanctions O
lists O
. O
Taliban O
2.0 O
was O
a O
mirage, O
and O
the O
Taliban O
today O
is O
Taliban O
1.0 O
with O
one O
major O
difference; O
they O
are O
far O
better O
armed O
than O
the O
Taliban O
that O
ruled O
over O
most O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
1996 O
to O
2001 O
. O
Now O
they O
ride O
into O
battle O
with O
American O
armored O
vehicles O
and O
M-16 O
rifles O
that O
were O
left O
behind O
as O
the O
US O
military O
rushed O
for O
the O
exits O
last O
summer O
. O
The O
Taliban O
today O
also O
face O
a O
far O
weaker O
opposition O
movement O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
than O
was O
the O
case O
for O
the O
pre-9/11 O
Taliban O
. O
Signaling O
weakness O
to O
Russia B-LOC
and O
China B-LOC
When O
Biden B-PER
spoke O
to O
the O
American O
people O
on O
Aug. O
31, O
2021 O
, O
as O
the O
last O
US O
soldiers O
departed O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
he O
framed O
the O
withdrawal O
as O
a O
way O
of O
positioning O
the O
US O
to O
compete O
better O
against O
great-power O
rivals, O
saying, O
“We’re O
engaged O
in O
a O
serious O
competition O
with O
China B-LOC
. O
We’re O
dealing O
with O
the O
challenges O
on O
multiple O
fronts O
with O
Russia B-LOC
… O
And O
there’s O
nothing O
China B-LOC
or O
Russia B-LOC
would O
rather O
have, O
would O
want O
more O
in O
this O
competition O
than O
the O
United O
States O
to O
be O
bogged O
down O
another O
decade O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
.” O
This O
was O
an O
absurd O
rationale: O
For O
years O
both O
China B-LOC
and O
Russia B-LOC
had O
hoped O
to O
push O
American O
forces O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
because O
the O
country O
borders O
both O
China B-LOC
and O
the O
republics O
of O
the O
former O
Soviet O
Union O
. O
Russia B-LOC
had O
covertly O
supported O
the O
Taliban O
, O
according O
to O
the O
US O
military, O
while O
the O
Chinese O
had O
drawn O
closer O
to O
the O
Taliban O
in O
recent O
years O
. O
As O
they O
pulled O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Americans O
abandoned O
the O
vast O
Bagram B-LOC
Air O
Base O
which O
could O
house O
up O
to O
10,000 O
troops; O
a O
more O
ideal O
site O
from O
which O
to O
engage O
in O
competition O
with O
either O
China B-LOC
or O
Russia B-LOC
is O
hard O
to O
imagine O
. O
You O
could O
practically O
hear O
the O
high O
fives O
in O
the O
Kremlin O
as O
the O
US O
ignominiously O
retreated O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
herald O
an O
era O
of O
the O
US O
pulling O
back O
from O
the O
world O
. O
It O
hardly O
seems O
accidental O
that O
three O
months O
later O
Russian O
President O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
moved O
an O
army O
to O
the O
border O
with O
Ukraine B-LOC
as O
a O
prelude O
to O
his O
invasion O
of O
the O
country O
. O
A O
predictable O
fiasco O
In O
June O
2021 O
, O
I O
wrote O
for O
CNN B-ORG
, O
“We O
could O
see O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
a O
remix O
of O
the O
disastrous O
US O
pullout O
from O
Saigon B-LOC
in O
1975 O
and O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
in O
Iraq O
when O
ISIS O
took O
over O
much O
of O
the O
country O
following O
the O
US O
pullout O
from O
the O
country O
.” O
That O
prediction, O
unfortunately, O
proved O
to O
be O
accurate; O
the O
American O
pullout O
from O
Saigon B-LOC
looked O
like O
a O
dignified O
retreat O
compared O
to O
the O
scenes O
of O
thousands O
of O
desperate O
Afghans O
trying O
to O
get O
on O
planes O
leaving O
Kabul B-LOC
airport O
last O
August O
. O
Some O
Afghans O
were O
so O
desperate O
to O
leave O
that O
they O
clung O
to O
the O
fuselage O
of O
a O
plane O
that O
was O
taking O
off O
– O
and O
two O
plunged O
to O
their O
deaths O
. O
On O
Aug. O
25, O
2021 O
, O
13 O
US O
soldiers O
and O
at O
least O
170 O
Afghans O
were O
killed O
at O
the O
airport O
by O
a O
suicide O
bomber O
dispatched O
by O
the O
Afghan O
branch O
of O
ISIS O
. O
And O
the O
Taliban O
took O
over O
the O
entire O
country O
even O
before O
the O
last O
US O
soldiers O
had O
left O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O
Compounding O
Biden’s O
disastrous O
policy O
decision O
to O
completely O
pull O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
was O
the O
botched O
handling O
of O
the O
withdrawal O
. O
According O
to O
a O
report O
about O
that O
withdrawal O
released O
in O
February O
by O
Republican O
senators O
sitting O
on O
the O
Senate O
Foreign O
Relations O
Committee, O
the O
first O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
meeting O
to O
discuss O
evacuating O
Americans O
and O
Afghans O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
took O
place O
on O
Aug. O
14, O
only O
one O
day O
before O
the O
Taliban O
seized O
Kabul B-LOC
and O
five O
months O
after O
Biden B-PER
had O
first O
publicly O
announced O
the O
total O
US O
withdrawal O
from O
the O
country O
. O
Biden B-PER
patted O
himself O
on O
the O
back O
that O
the O
US O
military O
subsequently O
extracted O
124,000 O
Afghans O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
calling O
the O
operation O
an O
“extraordinary O
success,” O
which O
was O
like O
an O
arsonist O
praising O
himself O
for O
helping O
to O
try O
to O
put O
out O
a O
fire O
that O
he O
had O
started O
. O
But O
even O
accepting O
the O
most O
self-congratulatory O
view O
of O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration I-PER
’s O
handling O
of O
the O
withdrawal O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
Afghans O
who O
had O
worked O
with O
the O
US O
were O
abandoned O
. O
The O
Association O
of O
Wartime O
Allies O
, O
an O
advocacy O
group O
for O
Afghans O
who O
had O
worked O
for O
the O
US O
, O
estimated O
in O
March O
that O
only O
about O
3% O
of O
the O
81,000 O
Afghans O
who O
had O
worked O
for O
the O
US O
government O
and O
had O
applied O
for O
special O
visas O
had O
made O
it O
out O
of O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
leaving O
78,000 O
behind O
. O
Four O
months O
after O
the O
Taliban O
took O
over O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
the O
Biden B-PER
administration I-PER
convened O
the O
“Summit O
for O
Democracy” O
in O
Washington O
consisting O
of O
the O
world’s O
democracies. O
Five O
months O
earlier O
Afghanistan B-LOC
would O
have O
warranted O
an O
invitation O
to O
this O
summit, O
but O
Biden B-PER
had O
enabled O
the O
Taliban O
to O
take O
over O
the O
country O
, O
which O
ended O
almost O
every O
shred O
of O
a O
liberal O
democracy O
that O
had O
once O
existed O
there O
. O
Following O
the O
Afghan O
debacle O
, O
Biden’s O
favorable O
ratings O
dropped O
to O
the O
lowest O
level O
of O
his O
presidency O
to O
that O
point O
to O
46% O
. O
They O
have O
never O
recovered O
. O
The O
Biden B-PER
administration I-PER
now O
faces O
a O
policy O
dilemma O
of O
its O
own O
making O
. O
Since O
so O
many O
millions O
of O
Afghans O
are O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
starvation, O
Biden B-PER
officials O
cannot O
completely O
turn O
their O
backs O
on O
Afghanistan B-LOC
. O
And O
yet, O
it’s O
hard O
to O
help O
Afghans O
without O
propping O
up O
the O
Taliban O
in O
some O
manner O
. O
The O
Biden B-PER
administration I-PER
has O
tried O
to O
ensure O
that O
all O
US O
aid O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
is O
administered O
in O
a O
way O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
end O
up O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Taliban O
, O
but O
realistically O
any O
help O
that O
the O
US O
sends O
to O
Afghanistan B-LOC
tends O
to O
help O
the O
Taliban O
remain O
in O
power O
. O
This O
is O
surely O
one O
of O
the O
most O
spectacular O
own O
goals O
the O
US O
has O
ever O
scored O
. O

Married O
and O
intimate O
couples O
are O
often O
looking O
for O
ways O
to O
maximize O
satisfaction O
and O
compatibility. O
Countless O
self-help O
books, O
seminars O
and O
relationship O
experts O
have O
weighed O
in O
on O
what O
they O
feel O
are O
the O
keys O
to O
a O
couple’s O
happiness O
and O
longevity. O
The O
ideas O
have O
varied O
quite O
a O
bit, O
including O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
spent O
together, O
shared O
interests O
and O
similar O
levels O
of O
intelligence, O
not O
to O
mention O
degrees O
of O
fondness O
and O
admiration O
for O
one O
another. O
It’s O
often O
said O
that O
longtime O
partners O
develop O
their O
own O
language, O
a O
shorthand O
from O
building O
a O
strong O
bond. O
In O
the O
same O
vein, O
consider O
the O
five O
love O
languages, O
which O
are O
acts O
of O
service, O
gift-giving, O
physical O
touch, O
quality O
time O
and O
words O
of O
affirmation. O
Thirty O
years O
ago, O
author, O
speaker O
and O
marriage O
counselor B-PER
Gary B-PER
Chapman I-PER
wrote O
“The O
Five O
Love O
Languages: O
How O
to O
Express O
Heartfelt O
Commitment O
to O
Your O
Mate.” O
If O
you O
learn O
which O
language O
your O
partner O
favors O
and O
act O
in O
accordance O
with O
that O
language, O
the O
theory O
goes, O
you O
will O
find O
more O
satisfaction O
and O
longevity O
in O
your O
relationship. O
Conversely, O
you O
waste O
time O
and O
energy O
if O
you O
exert O
effort O
in O
other O
areas. O
This O
energy, O
Chapman B-PER
argued, O
can O
even O
be O
counterproductive, O
as O
your O
partner O
may O
feel O
neither O
heard O
nor O
understood. O
Being O
attuned O
to O
a O
partner’s O
love O
language O
was O
associated O
with O
both O
relationship O
and O
sexual O
satisfaction O
for O
heterosexual O
couples, O
found O
a O
June O
study O
published O
by O
the O
journal O
PLOS O
One. O
In O
particular, O
people O
who O
expressed O
their O
affection O
in O
the O
way O
their O
partner O
preferred O
to O
receive O
it O
experienced O
greater O
satisfaction O
with O
the O
relationship O
and O
were O
more O
sexually O
satisfied O
compared O
with O
those O
who O
met O
their O
partner’s O
needs O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent. O
I O
interviewed O
relationship O
experts O
on O
how O
they O
use O
this O
concept O
in O
their O
work O
and O
how O
it O
might O
be O
useful O
in O
enhancing O
relationship O
satisfaction. O
Do O
you O
use O
the O
5 O
love O
languages O
in O
your O
work, O
and O
do O
you O
find O
them O
helpful? O

out O
there O

some O
misunderstandings O

how O
they O
are O
best O
used O
in O

She O
suggested O
that O
most O

all O
five, O
but O
their O
preferences O
vary O
depending O
on O
the O
day O
and O
the O

A O
continuous O
single O
preference O
is O
a O
myth, O
she O
said. O
“I O
find O
that O
these O
love O
languages O
are O
not O
absolute,” O
Gandhi B-PER
said. O
“We O
may O
favor O
one O
at O
a O
point O
in O
time, O
but O
that O
may O
well O
vary O
over O
time O
as O
well.” O

sex O
and O
relationship O
therapist O
in O
Los O
Angeles B-LOC
and O
author O
of O
“Quantum O
Love: O
Use O
Your O
Body’s O
Atomic O
Energy O
to O
Create O
the O
Relationship O
You O
Desire,” O
takes O
a O
slightly O
different O
approach. O
Berman I-PER
finds O
the O
love O
languages O
to O
be O
a O
helpful O
jumping-off O
point O
to O
educate O
her O
clients. O
The O
love O
languages O
allow O
people O
to O
realize, O
she O
suggested, O
that O
love O
on O
its O
own O
is O
not O
enough. O
It O
needs O
to O
be O
acted O
upon O
in O
a O
way O
that O
makes O
a O
partner O
feel O
loved O
and O
seen. O
“What O
I O
like O
about O
the O
love O
languages O
is O
that O
they O
are O
great O
prompts O
to O
talk O
about O
with O
your O
partner,” O
Gandhi B-PER
added. O
“We O
tend O
to O
understand O
our O
own O
love O
languages. O
But O
in O
my O
work O
and O
my O
own O
relationship, O
people O
often O
don’t O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
do O
the O
same O
for O
their O
partner.” O
Gandhi B-PER
and O
Berman I-PER
agreed O
that O
love O
languages O
are O
helpful O
because O
they O
allow O
an O
individual O
or O
couple O
to O
gauge O
where O
they O
stand O
in O
a O
relationship. O
“I O
encourage O
my O
clients O
to O
ask O
themselves O
whether O
they O
are O
doing O
a O
pretty O
good O
job O
across O
all O
five O
languages,” O
Gandhi B-PER
said, O
“even O
if O
one O
or O
two O
of O
them O
are O
favored O
by O
your O
partner.” O
Is O
it O
important O
that O
couples O
have O
the O
same O
love O
language? O
“No, O
not O
at O
all. O
Love O
languages O
are O
as O
varied O
as O
can O
be,” O
Berman I-PER
said O
via O
email. O
She O
indicated O
there O
are O
actually O
many O
more O
than O
the O
traditional O
five O
languages. O
She O
said O
she O
feels O
finding O
a O
partner O
with O
the O
exact O
same O
language O
could O
be O
impossible, O
but O
more O
importantly, O
love O
languages O
aren’t O
about O
people O
learning O
to O
love O
the O
exact O
same O
way O
as O
their O
partners. O
Rather, O
the O
theory O
of O
love O
languages O
is O
about O
learning O
that O
we O
all O
experience O
reality O
differently O
and O
have O
unique O
and O
sometimes O
mysterious O
internal O
lives. O
The O
way O
to O
achieve O
longevity O
and O
satisfaction O
is O
not O
by O
speaking O
the O
same O
love O
language O
as O
your O
partner, O
Berman I-PER
said, O
but O
honoring O
that O
your O
partner O
may O
experience O
the O
world O
differently O
than O
you O
and O
making O
a O
commitment O
to O
seek O
out O
ways O
to O
make O
your O
partner O
feel O
loved. O
It’s O
about O
bringing O
the O
energy O
you O
want O
to O
experience O
into O
your O
relationship, O
rather O
than O
waiting O
for O
a O
happy O
ending O
to O
be O
handed O
to O
you, O
she O
said. O
Is O
it O
important O
to O
know O
and O
respond O
to O
your O
partner’s O
love O
language? O
Gandhi B-PER
agreed O
that O
it’s O
important O
to O
respond O
to O
a O
partner’s O
preferred O
love O
language O
but O
also O
to O
recognize O
there O
isn’t O
just O
one O
playbook. O
One O
day, O
your O
partner O
might O
need O
quality O
time O
from O
you. O
But O
on O
their O
birthday, O
for O
instance, O
they O
might O
want O
a O
gift. O
They O
may O
need O
physical O
affection O
on O
another O
day. O
And O
along O
with O
the O
five O
love O
languages, O
other O
needs O
may O
arise O
in O
relationships, O
including O
good O
listening O
skills O
or O
knowing O
when O
to O
provide O
your O
partner O
some O
space, O
either O
physically O
or O
emotionally. O
Instead O
of O
following O
a O
love O
language O
playbook, O
Berman I-PER
said, O
partners O
need O
to O
be O
curious O
about O
how O
to O
satisfy O
one O
another. O
Vulnerability O
is O
a O
necessity, O
so O
focus O
on O
learning O
what O
barriers O
you O
may O
have O
erected O
to O
prevent O
you O
from O
being O
seen O
or O
heard. O
Can O
it O
be O
problematic O
not O
to O
know O
your O
partner’s O
love O
language? O
It’s O
problematic O
to O
have O
a O
relationship O
that O
isn’t O
built O
on O
communication, O
consistency O
and O
shared O
intentions O
to O
protect O
and O
nourish O
your O
bonds, O
Berman I-PER
said. O
“Love O
languages O
are O
just O
one O
resource O
you O
can O
use O
to O
help O
deepen O
your O
bond, O
but O
for O
many O
people, O
they O
just O
take O
the O
online O
love O
language O
quiz O
and O
sort O
of O
forget O
about O
it O
shortly O
thereafter. O
If O
you O
actually O
use O
the O
information O
to O
actively O
make O
choices O
to O
celebrate O
your O
love O
and O
nourish O
your O
relationship, O
then O
it O
can O
be O
very O
helpful,” O
she O
said O
via O
email. O
Gandhi B-PER
agreed O
but O
placed O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
utility O
of O
discussing O
the O
five O
languages. O
She O
suggested O
couples O
talk O
about O
the O
five O
languages O
and O
understand O
what O
each O
partner O
feels O
like O
is O
their O
most O
consistently O
important O
one O
or O
maybe O
two. O
A O
discussion O
might O
start O
with O
, O
“Hey, O
I O
know O
quality O
time O
is O
really O
important O
to O
you. O
Do O
you O
feel O
like O
we’ve O
shared O
enough O
quality O
time O
together?” O
Overall, O
it’s O
helpful O
for O
couples O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
love O
languages O
and O
make O
sure O
they’re O
happy O
with O
the O
love O
they’re O
receiving. O
And O
to O
maximize O
satisfaction O
and O
longevity, O
open O
communication O
around O
relationship O
needs O
is O
critical. O
After O
all, O
as O
I O
know O
from O
my O
own O
practice, O
couples O
want O
their O
partner O
to O
feel O
loved O
the O
way O
they O
want O
to O
be O
loved. O
Talking O
through O
the O
love O
languages O
may O
not O
be O
the O
sole O
answer, O
but O
it’s O
a O
start. O

To O

or O
not O
to O
be O
, O
that O
is O
the O
question O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
former O
President B-PER
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
’s O
potential O
2024 O
presidential O
campaign O
. O
The O
man O
who O
used O
to O
occupy O
the O
Oval B-ORG
Office I-ORG
has O
been O
holding O
rallies O
and O
endorsing O
candidates O
across O
the O
country O
this O
primary O
season O
. O
And O
this O
past O
week O
provided O
crucial O
tests O
of O
his O
influence O
, O
from O
Michigan B-LOC
down O
to O
Kansas B-LOC
, O
across O
to O
Arizona B-LOC
and O
up O
to O
Washington B-LOC
state O
. O
It O
is O
with O
Trump’s O
strength O
within O
the O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
that O
we O
begin O
our O
weekly O
journey O
into O
the O
numbers O
. O
Trump B-PER
is O
still O
strong O
among O
Republicans O
Political O
analysts O
have O
long O
wondered O
when O
, O
or O
if O
, O
Trump’s O
grip O
on O
the O
Republican B-ORG
electorate O
is O
going O
to O
cease O
. O
There O
have O
been O
plenty O
of O
articles O
written O
about O
how O
his O
influence O
may O
very O
well O
be O
on O
the O
decline O
. O
This O
past O
week O
, O
however O
, O
offered O
proof O
that O
Trump B-PER
remains O
a O
power O
center O
within O
the O
party O
. O
It O
fits O
with O
other O
data O
suggesting O
that O
while O
the O
former O
President B-PER
may O
not O
be O
as O
powerful O
as O
he O
once O
was O
, O
he O
remains O
a O
force O
to O
be O
reckoned O
with O
in O
the O
GOP O
. O
Trump-backed O
candidates O
swept O
important O
statewide O
primaries O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
including O
for O
governor O
( O
where O
Trump’s O
candidate O
defeated O
the O
one O
endorsed O
by O
former O
Vice B-PER
President I-PER
Mike B-PER
Pence I-PER
) O
, O
US B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
, O
state O
attorney O
general O
and O
secretary O
of O
state O
. O
All O
of O
them O
deny O
the O
fact O
that O
Joe B-PER
Biden I-PER
legitimately O
won O
the O
2020 O
presidential O
election O
. O
Likewise O
, O
in O
Michigan B-LOC
, O
Trump-endorsed O
Tudor B-PER
Dixon I-PER
won O
the O
Republican B-ORG
nomination O
for O
governor O
. O
And O
US B-ORG
Rep I-ORG
. O
Peter B-PER
Meijer I-PER
, O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
last O
year O
after O
January O
6 O
, O
went O
down O
to O
defeat O
in O
the O
GOP O
primary O
to O
another O
Trump-backed O
election O
denier O
in O
the O
3rd O
Congressional O
District O
. O
Trump’s O
pick O
for O
Kansas B-LOC
governor O
( O
Derek B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
) O
won O
his O
primary O
as O
well O
. O
The O
former O
President B-PER
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
this O
primary O
season O
in O
GOP O
contests O
with O
no O
incumbents O
or O
those O
featuring O
two O
sitting O
lawmakers O
because O
of O
redistricting O
. O
By O
my O
count O
, O
his O
candidates O
have O
won O
slightly O
less O
than O
90% O
of O
contested O
primaries O
for O
governor O
or O
Congress O
that O
had O
either O
no O
incumbents O
or O
two O
incumbents O
because O
of O
redistricting O
. O
That O
’s O
a O
strong O
number O
, O
though O
down O
from O
the O
96% O
of O
such O
primaries O
his O
candidates O
won O
in O
the O
2020 O
cycle O
. O
So O
far O
, O
the O
only O
major O
contest O
from O
the O
past O
week O
that O
a O
Trump B-PER
candidate O
lost O
was O
in O
the O
open O
primary O
for O
Washington B-LOC
’s O
4th O
District O
. O
GOP O
Rep I-ORG
. O
Dan B-PER
Newhouse I-PER
advanced O
to O
the O
general O
election O
under O
the O
state O
’s O
top O
two O
primary O
system O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
and O
had O
to O
withstand O
a O
challenge O
from O
the O
Trump-endorsed O
Loren B-PER
Culp I-PER
, O
who O
has O
been O
in O
third O
place O
. O
But O
even O
Newhouse’s O
advancement O
proves O
the O
point O
that O
Trump B-PER
remains O
a O
power O
center O
in O
the O
GOP O
. O
As O
of O
Sunday O
, O
Newhouse O
was O
pulling O
in O
a O
little O
more O
than O
25% O
of O
the O
primary O
vote O
and O
only O
34% O
of O
those O
who O
voted O
for O
a O
Republican B-ORG
candidate O
in O
the O
district O
. O
That O
is O
incredibly O
weak O
for O
a O
sitting O
member O
of O
Congress O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Newhouse O
and O
California B-LOC
’s O
David B-PER
Valadao I-PER
, O
the O
only O
other O
Republican O
so O
far O
who O
voted O
to O
impeach O
Trump B-PER
and O
made O
it O
to O
the O
November O
ballot O
, O
have O
commanded O
about O
25% O
of O
the O
primary O
vote O
. O
And O
both O
have O
done O
so O
in O
primaries O
where O
all O
candidates O
, O
regardless O
of O
party O
affiliation O
, O
ran O
on O
the O
same O
ballot O
with O
the O
top O
two O
vote-getters O
advancing O
to O
November O
– O
which O
means O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
non-Republicans O
voting O
. O
Trump’s O
success O
in O
primaries O
this O
season O
shouldn’t O
be O
all O
that O
surprising O
given O
the O
national O
polls O
. O
His O
very O
favorable O
rating O
among O
Republicans O
is O
in O
the O
low O
50s O
. O
This O
is O
down O
from O
around O
70% O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
2020 O
campaign O
, O
but O
it O
means O
that O
a O
little O
more O
than O
half O
of O
Republicans O
really O
like O
Trump B-PER
. O
There O
isn’t O
another O
active O
candidate O
who O
comes O
close O
to O
that O
level O
of O
adoration O
. O
Speaking O
of O
candidates O
who O
aren’t O
Trump B-PER
, O
few O
nonincumbents O
have O
ever O
polled O
at O
or O
above O
where O
Trump B-PER
is O
currently O
in O
early O
national O
presidential O
primary O
polls O
– O
he O
’s O
at O
about O
50% O
of O
the O
national O
primary O
vote O
. O
The O
non-Trump O
candidates O
to O
have O
done O
so O
in O
the O
modern O
primary O
era O
appear O
to O
be O
Democrats O
Al B-PER
Gore I-PER
, O
in O
1998 O
, O
and O
Hillary B-PER
Clinton I-PER
, O
in O
2014 O
. O
Both O
went O
on O
to O
win O
their O
party’s O
nomination O
in O
the O
next O
presidential O
election O
. O
The O
closest O
Republicans O
were O
George B-PER
H.W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
in O
1986 O
and O
George B-PER
W. I-PER
Bush I-PER
in O
1998 O
. O
Both O
were O
polling O
in O
the O
low O
40s O
and O
would O
go O
on O
to O
win O
the O
GOP O
nomination O
. O
While O
it O
is O
true O
Florida B-LOC
Gov I-LOC
. O
Ron B-PER
DeSantis I-PER
has O
been O
gaining O
on O
Trump B-PER
nationally O
, O
he O
’s O
still O
about O
25 O
points O
behind O
him O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
best O
way O
to O
understand O
Trump’s O
standing O
in O
the O
GOP O
is O
to O
look O
at O
the O
verbs O
“could” O
and O
“will” O
. O
Trump B-PER
could O
be O
beat O
if O
he O
decides O
to O
run O
for O
the O
Republican B-ORG
nomination O
. O
He O
will O
, O
however O
, O
be O
tough O
to O
beat O
. O
A O
hazy O
picture O
three O
months O
before O
Election O
Day O
Before O
we O
get O
ahead O
of O
ourselves O
with O
all O
this O
2024 O
talk O
, O
there O
’s O
a O
big O
election O
to O
be O
held O
this O
year O
! O
The O
2022 O
midterms O
are O
only O
about O
three O
months O
away O
, O
and O
the O
picture O
has O
become O
more O
uncertain O
as O
we O
approach O
the O
date O
. O
Normally O
, O
midterms O
follow O
a O
simple O
pattern O
. O
The O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
party O
loses O
seats O
in O
Congress O
( O
especially O
the O
House O
) O
. O
This O
is O
especially O
the O
case O
when O
the O
incumbent O
president O
has O
an O
approval O
rating O
below O
50% O
. O
Biden’s O
approval O
rating O
is O
below O
40% O
. O
Yet O
, O
the O
generic O
congressional O
ballot O
keeps O
getting O
tighter O
. O
The O
3-point O
lead O
Republicans O
held O
in O
May O
has O
completely O
disappeared O
by O
now O
. O
( O
The O
generic O
ballot O
usually O
asks O
respondents O
some O
form O
of O
the O
following O
question O
: O
“If O
the O
elections O
for O
Congress O
were O
held O
today O
, O
would O
you O
vote O
for O
the O
Democratic O
or O
Republican B-ORG
party O
?” O
) O
This O
is O
unusual O
. O
Often O
, O
the O
challenging O
party O
improves O
its O
position O
on O
the O
generic O
ballot O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
midterm O
cycle O
. O
The O
haziness O
in O
the O
national O
environment O
can O
be O
tied O
to O
what O
voters O
feel O
are O
the O
important O
issues O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
economy O
is O
the O
No. O
1 O
issue O
. O
And O
yes O
, O
inflation O
remains O
historically O
high O
. O
This O
has O
led O
to O
a O
decline O
in O
real O
disposable O
income O
per O
capita O
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O
money O
Americans O
have O
to O
spend O
) O
. O
Yet O
, O
there O
are O
facets O
of O
the O
economy O
that O
are O
quite O
good O
or O
at O
least O
improving O
. O
We O
are O
tied O
for O
the O
lowest O
unemployment O
rate O
in O
over O
50 O
years O
. O
The O
stock O
market O
is O
up O
. O
Gas O
prices O
are O
down O
from O
their O
June O
peak O
. O
Moreover O
, O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
besides O
the O
economy O
at O
play O
. O
Abortion O
may O
not O
rank O
as O
high O
on O
the O
list O
of O
voter O
priorities O
as O
the O
economy O
, O
but O
more O
Americans O
than O
at O
any O
point O
since O
at O
least O
1984 O
say O
it O
is O
a O
top O
problem O
. O
We O
saw O
this O
past O
week O
that O
abortion O
can O
motivate O
voters O
. O
Democrats O
saw O
a O
massive O
increase O
in O
voter O
turnout O
in O
Kansas B-LOC
compared O
with O
every O
other O
primary O
so O
far O
this O
season O
. O
Answering O
the O
question O
of O
who O
will O
control O
Congress O
next O
year O
has O
become O
muddled O
in O
another O
way O
as O
well O
: O
The O
House O
and O
the O
Senate O
may O
be O
controlled O
by O
different O
parties O
. O
Democrats O
will O
likely O
lose O
the O
House O
, O
even O
as O
the O
national O
picture O
for O
them O
improves O
. O
They O
just O
have O
too O
much O
exposure O
. O
Democrats O
, O
though O
, O
are O
no O
more O
than O
a O
slight O
underdog O
in O
their O
effort O
to O
retain O
Senate O
control O
. O
We O
’ve O
seen O
good O
recent O
polling O
for O
them O
in O
battleground O
states O
such O
Georgia B-LOC
and O
Pennsylvania B-LOC
. O
Those O
same O
polls O
reveal O
that O
Republicans O
have O
had O
a O
problem O
nominating O
candidates O
who O
aren’t O
well O
liked O
. O
The O
bottom O
line O
is O
people O
who O
are O
into O
elections O
are O
in O
for O
an O
exciting O
final O
three O
months O
of O
the O
2022 O
campaign O
. O
For O
your O
brief O
encounters O
: O
Football O
has O
begun O
America’s O
No. O
1 O
sport O
got O
underway O
Thursday O
, O
with O
the O
first O
preseason O
game O
between O
the O
Jacksonville B-LOC
Jaguars I-LOC
and O
Las B-LOC
Vegas I-LOC
Raiders I-LOC
broadcast O
nationally O
on O
NBC O
. O
And O
despite O
it O
being O
a O
completely O
meaningless O
affair O
, O
more O
than O
5 O
million O
people O
tuned O
in O
. O
That O
is O
a O
small O
audience O
given O
how O
many O
people O
watch O
regular O
season O
games O
. O
But O
in O
a O
sign O
of O
how O
strong O
a O
brand O
the O
NFL O
is O
, O
the O
game O
was O
by O
far O
the O
highest O
rated O
show O
of O
the O
night O
. O
Just O
remember O
: O
The O
preseason O
doesn’t O
matter O
. O
The O
last O
two O
teams O
to O
lose O
every O
single O
regular O
season O
game O
in O
a O
season O
won O
every O
game O
that O
preseason O
. O
Leftover O
data O
Drinkers O
and O
nondrinkers O
actually O
agree O
: O
A O
new O
Gallup O
poll O
shows O

It’s O
an O
accounting O

retiring O

so O

no O

His O
problem O
is O
the O
versions O

considered O

The O
version O

currently O

make O
the O

essentially O
permanent O

place O
it O
in O
the O
category O

it’s O

also O
could O
create O
some O

Toomey’s B-PER
specific O
concern O
is O
Section O
805 O
of O

With O
the O
title O
“Cost O
of O

the O

clear O
that O

“No O

” O
Toomey B-PER

unapologetic O
for O
opposing O
this O

standing O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
bill O

He O
explained O
his O
position O
on O
“State O

” O
on O
Sunday O

worries O
that O
by O
switching O
the O

it O
would O
free O
up O

what’s O
going O

” O
It O
may O

a O
bill O
to O
help O

an O

Toomey’s B-PER
approach O
would O
put O
an O
annual O

end O
the O

What O
’s O
the O
subtext O
here O
? O
Republicans O
feel O
played O
that O

on O
the O
cusp O
of O
using O
reconciliation O
– O
a O
very O
different O
budget O
gimmick O
both O
sides O
have O
used O
in O
recent O
years O

to O
pass O
health O
care O

climate O
legislation O

The O
deal O
among O
Democrats O
for O
the O
health O

climate O
legislation O
was O
hatched O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
with O
Sen. B-PER
Joe B-PER
Manchin I-PER
of O
West B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
. O
It O
was O
announced O
just O
after O
Republicans O

a O
bipartisan O
bill O
to O
prop O
up O
a O
US B-ORG
semiconductor O
industry O
. O
Lawmakers O
of O
all O
stripes O
want O
to O
wrap O
up O

get O
out O
on O
the O
campaign O
trail O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
August O
since O
the O
November O
midterm O
election O
is O
fast O
approaching O
. O
Possible O
ways O
out O
Republicans O
could O
buckle O
to O
public O
pressure O
to O
allow O
a O
vote O
on O
the O
measure O
, O
which O
has O
plenty O
of O
support O
to O
pass O
. O
Democrats O
could O
buckle O
to O
Republican O
pressure O
to O
allow O
consideration O
of O
amendments O
and O
potentially O
changing O
budget O
language O
in O
the O

, O
neither O
side O
buckles O

the O
burn O

dies O

Both O
sides O
want O

for O

them O

So O
we O

we O

that O

“ O

” O
Reynal B-PER

argued O
for O
a O

lower O
sum O

suggesting O
that O
the O

should O
multiply O
Jones’ B-PER

earnings O

the O
$150 O

the O

attorneys O
had O
sought O
. O
In O
his O
closing O

, O
Ball B-PER
thanked O
the O
jury O
for O
their O
decision O
to O
award O
the O
$4.1 O
million O
, O
saying O
it O
had O
already O
made O
a O

asked O
them O

enough O
in O
punitive O

bring O
the O

He O
has O
since O

Jones B-PER
claimed O

his O
testimony O
that O
a O

of O
just O
$2 O

destroy O
him O
financially O

two O

Pettingill B-PER

After O
one O

out O

the O

a O

fired O
its O

to O
back O
away O
after O
its O
quick O
collection O
of O
dust O

it O
might O
have O
sunk O

Lucy B-PER
Yu I-PER
found O
refuge O
in O
books O
growing O
up. O
An O
only O
child O
raised O
by O
a O
Chinese B-MISC
immigrant O
mother O
in O
west O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
, O
she O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
bookstores. O
But O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
stories O
she O
connected O
to O
most O
– O
those O
written O
by O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
– O
were O
often O
relegated O
to O
a O
single O
shelf O
or O
a O
heritage O
month O
display. O
“I O
just O
wanted O
to O
walk O
into O
a O
place O
where O
I O
didn’t O
have O
to O
search O
that O
much,” O
she O
said. O
Yu B-PER
, O
a O
chemical O
engineer O
by O
training, O
started O
researching O
and O
found O
an O
abundance O
of O
titles O
going O
back O
decades O
from O
authors O
with O
names O
or O
backgrounds O
like O
hers. O
But O
she O
said O
many O
of O
those O
books O
had O
quickly O
been O
placed O
on O
the O
backlist, O
a O
publishing O
term O
referring O
to O
older O
books O
that O
are O
still O
in O
print O
but O
typically O
aren’t O
being O
actively O
promoted. O
“I O
think O
that O
the O
publishing O
industry O
didn’t O
think O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
sell O
or O
didn’t O
think O
that O
people O
were O
interested O
in O
our O
stories,” O
Yu B-PER
added. O
“But O
they O
had O
always O
been O
there O
and O
these O
authors O
and O
these O
writers O
and O
these O
stories O
have O
always O
been O
there.” O
Yu B-PER
launched O
a O
crowdfunding O
campaign O
last O
year O
to O
turn O
her O
vision O
into O
reality, O
and O
hit O
her O
goal O
in O
just O
a O
few O
weeks, O
affirming O
that O
she O
wasn’t O
alone O
in O
wanting O
more O
of O
these O
books. O
In O
December, O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
opened O
its O
doors O
in O
Manhattan B-LOC
’s O
Chinatown I-LOC
, O
and O
has O
been O
steadily O
growing O
since. O
The O
store O
now O
has O
four O
staff O
members, O
including O
Yu B-PER
. O
The O
bookstore O
has O
also O
become O
a O
literary O
and O
community O
hub. O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
has O
hosted O
conversations O
with O
immigrant O
authors, O
a O
pop-up O
book O
workshop O
and O
clothing O
swaps. O
And O
as O
Asian B-MISC
Americans I-MISC
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
including O
Chinatown B-LOC
, O
faced O
attacks O
against O
their O
communities, O
the O
store O
partnered O
with O
the O
nonprofit O
Soar B-ORG
Over I-ORG
Hate I-ORG
to O
hand O
out O
free O
pepper O
spray O
and O
personal O
safety O
devices. O
Yu B-PER
sees O
room O
for O
progress O
in O
publishing O
Despite O
this, O
Yu B-PER
didn’t O
set O
out O
to O
open O
an O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
bookstore O
. O
When O
she O
first O
conceived O
of O
her O
small O
business, O
she O
dreamed O
of O
a O
space O
that O
would O
reflect O
the O
rich O
diversity O
of O
her O
community. O
She O
envisioned O
a O
place O
dedicated O
to O
stories O
written O
by O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
– O
which O
happened O
to O
include O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
authors O
. O
The O
space O
still O
reflects O
her O
vision. O
But O
perhaps O
because O
of O
Yu B-PER
’s O
own O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
identity, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
her O
bookstore’s O
historic O
location O
or O
perhaps O
because O
of O
a O
hunger O
among O
Asian B-MISC
Americans I-MISC
for O
authentic O
depictions O
of O
their O
communities, O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
has O
since O
become O
a O
go-to O
for O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
readers O
hoping O
to O
find O
their O
experiences O
reflected O
on O
its O
shelves. O
“It’s O
been O
really O
interesting O
seeing O
how O
I O
’ve O
kind O
of O
been O
pushed O
into O
the O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
bookstores O
lane,” O
she O
said. O
“I O
think O
that O
if O
I O
weren’t O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
, O
I O
may O
not O
have O
had O
to O
put O
myself O
within O
that O
slot.” O
That O
feeling O
of O
being O
pigeonholed O
is O
familiar O
for O
many O
Asian B-MISC
Americans I-MISC
, O
whether O
they O
work O
in O
media, O
the O
restaurant O
industry O
or O
the O
literary O
scene O
like O
Yu B-PER
. O
For O
so O
long, O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
representation O
in O
creative O
sectors O
has O
been O
scarce, O
while O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
depictions O
in O
popular O
culture O
have O
been O
replete O
with O
tired O
tropes O
and O
stereotypes. O
So O
when O
Yu B-PER
launched O
her O
community-centered O
bookstore O
last O
year, O
it O
came O
with O
added O
pressure O
and O
expectations. O
While O
Yu B-PER
has O
held O
to O
her O
mission O
of O
highlighting O
stories O
of O
immigrants O
and O
people O
of O
color O
more O
broadly, O
she O
’s O
leaned O
into O
customers’ O
demand O
for O
books O
by O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
authors O
. O
Most O
of O
her O
inventory O
now O
skews O
toward O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
books, O
she O
said O
– O
making O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
a O
rare O
and O
special O
place O
. O
“As O
someone O
who’s O
thinking O
about O
my O
own O
identity O
and O
also O
a O
business O
owner, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
support O
whoever O
wants O
to O
come O
in O
and O
find O
books O
that O
represent O
themselves,” O
she O
said. O
“But O
I O
love O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
love O
and O
desire O
for O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
books O
and O
representation O
.” O
Still, O
Yu B-PER
makes O
it O
a O
point O
to O
both O
challenge O
and O
delight O
visitors O
to O
her O
store. O
Her O
shelves O
include O
bestsellers O
such O
as O
Min B-PER
Jin I-PER
Lee I-PER
’s O
“Pachinko” O
and O
Michelle B-PER
Zauner I-PER
’s O
“Crying O
in O
H O
Mart,” O
as O
well O
as O
niche O
titles O
from O
smaller O
presses. O
Visitors O
can O
thumb O
through O
cookbooks, O
romance O
novels, O
young O
adult O
novels O
and O
poetry O
volumes O
by O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
authors O
– O
and O
the O
selection O
keeps O
growing. O
For O
a O
couple O
hours O
most O
evenings, O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
in O
hand, O
Yu B-PER
researches O
what O
other O
books O
she O
doesn’t O
yet O
know O
about O
that O
she O
might O
acquire. O
“One O
of O
my O
favorite O
things O
that O
I O
hear O
when O
customers O
come O
in O
the O
store O
(is), O
‘I O
’ve O
never O
heard O
of O
this O
title O
before’ O
or O
‘I O
’ve O
never O
seen O
like O
40% O
of O
this O
inventory O
before.’ O
” O
Yu B-PER
said. O
“That O
makes O
me O
so O
happy O
because O
you O
can O
connect O
to O
a O
story O
that O
’s O
not O
necessarily O
being O
pushed O
by O
publishers.” O
As O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
celebrates O
and O
showcases O
the O
breadth O
of O
works O
that O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
writers O
have O
produced O
over O
decades, O
Yu B-PER
also O
encourages O
her O
visitors O
to O
keep O
an O
open O
mind O
. O
“I O
also O
try O
to O
remind O
readers O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
that O
outside O
the O
Asian B-MISC
American I-MISC
experience, O
there O
’s O
so O
many O
books O
written O
by O
other O
immigrants O
that O
we O
can O
relate O
to O
very O
much,” O
she O
added. O
In O
the O
time O
that O
Yu B-PER
and O
Me B-ORG
Books I-ORG
has O
been O
open, O
Yu B-PER
said O
she O
’s O
seen O
positive O
changes O
in O
the O
publishing O
industry. O
She O
’s O
seeing O
more O
diversity O
in O
the O
authors O
who O
are O
getting O
published, O
but O
those O
authors O
are O
often O
called O
upon O
to O
be O
“educators O
of O
our O
experience,” O
Yu B-PER
said. O
As O
exciting O
as O
it O
is O
to O
see O
these O
experiences O
represented O
authentically, O
she O
hopes O
the O
industry O
will O
reach O
a O
point O
where O
authors O
can O
transcend O
their O
identities O
. O
“I O
want O
authors O
of O
color O
to O
just O
write O
about O
unicorns O
or O
cupcakes O
– O
whatever O
they O
want O
to O
write O
about,” O
she O
added. O

Expect O

“ O
Every O
weather O
event O
has O
some O
flavor O
of O
climate O
change O
in O
it O
because O
it’s O
impossible O
to O
decouple O
them O
, O
” O
Reed B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O
It’s O
another O
sign O
that O
climate O
change O
is O
here O
. O
It’s O
not O
just O
a O
challenge O
for O
the O
next O
400 O
years O
from O
now O
or O
50 O
years O
from O
now O
; O
in O
reality O
, O
it’s O
something O
that O
we O
need O
to O
rapidly O
adjust O
to O
, O
adapt O
to O
and O
become O
more O
resilient O
to O
now O
. O
Climate O
experts O
anticipate O
heavy O
rain O
events O
to O
increase O
in O
intensity O
and O
frequency O
as O
the O
planet O
warms O
, O
since O
warmer O
air O
can O
hold O
more O
moisture O
. O
That O
concept O
is O
easier O
for O
most O
people O
to O
grasp O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
hurricane O
, O
Reed B-PER
said O
. O
For O
instance O
, O
Hurricane O
Harvey B-MISC
in O
2017 O
dumped O
more O
than O
60 O
inches O
of O
rain O
in O
parts O
of O
Texas B-LOC
and O
slammed O
the O
coast O
with O
an O
8-foot O
storm O
surge O
. O
Scientists O
have O
said O
climate O
change O
made O
Harvey B-MISC
’s O
rainfall O
more O
extreme O
. O
But O
that O
same O
process O
plays O
out O
over O
land O
as O
water O
evaporates O
from O
the O
soil O
, O
grass O
, O
crops O
and O
forests O
. O
And O
more O
moisture O
can O
be O
drawn O
out O
of O
soil O
and O
vegetation O
the O
warmer O
it O
gets O
. O
“ O
Part O
of O
that O
is O
the O
general O
circulation O
of O
the O
atmosphere-ocean O
system O
which O
moves O
air O
around O
the O
world O
and O
brings O
moisture O
into O
areas O
over O
land O
, O
” O
Reed B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Another O
aspect O
is O
that O
, O
over O
the O
last O
100 O
plus O
years O
, O
the O
land O
surface O
has O
actually O
warmed O
more O
than O
the O
ocean O
, O
so O
the O
largest O
signal O
that O
we O
’re O
actually O
seeing O
in O
surface O
temperature O
is O
occurring O
overland O
, O
and O
inland O
as O
well O
. O
What O
it O
adds O
up O
to O
is O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
dangerous O
flooding O
. O
“ O
While O
extreme O
events O
and O
floods O
have O
sort O
of O
always O
been O
a O
part O
of O
a O
climate O
cycle O
, O
they O
can O
get O
more O
frequent O
and O
they O
can O
be O
a O

10 O
years O
in O
the O
making,” O
CNN B-ORG

correspondent O
Brian B-PER
Stelter I-PER
said. O
A O
pair O
of O
Chicago B-LOC
-based O
podcast O
hosts O
have O
spent O
the O
past O
5 O
years O
holding O
Jones O
and O
his O
Infowars B-ORG
network O
accountable. O
Their O
program, O
Knowledge B-MISC
Fight, I-MISC
has O
produced O
more O
than O
700 O
episodes, O
and O
uses O
comedy O
to O
“cut O
through O
crazy O
lies,” O
Stelter O
said O
on O
Reliable B-MISC
Sources I-MISC
Sunday. O
Hosts O
Dan B-PER
Friesen I-PER
and O
Jordan B-PER
Holmes I-PER
traveled O
to O
Texas B-LOC
to O
witness O
Jones O
’ O
trial O
first O
hand. O
Friesen B-PER
said O
the O
most O
powerful O
moment O
inside O
the O
courtroom O
was O
watching O
Jesse B-PER
Lewis I-PER
’ O
mom O
Scarlett B-PER
Lewis I-PER
give O
her O
testimony O
and O
speak O
directly O
to O
Jones O
. O
“I O
think O
it O
will O
stay O
with O
pretty O
much O
everyone O
there O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
lives,” O
Friesen O
said O
The O
co-hosts O
have O
been O
covering O
Jones O
since O
2017, O
watching O
his O
transformation O
from O
a O
seemingly O
untouchable O
figure O
to O
one O
that O
is O
now O
in O
serious O
legal O
and O
financial O
jeopardy. O
“During O
this O
whole O
stretch O
of O
time, O
his O
content O
itself O
has O
been O
essentially O
hollow,” O
Friesen O
said O
“Watching O
him O
from O
my O
perspective O
has O
gotten O
a O
lot O
less O
interesting.” O
But O
despite O
Jones O
’ O
legal O
woes, O
Holmes O
said O
that O
the O
culture O
he’s O
helped O
engender O
has O
gotten O
a O
lot O
bigger. O
“Conspiracy O
culture O
is O
something O
that O
is O
created O
through O
the O
cracks O
of O
our O
regular O
society,” O
Holmes O
said O
And O
although O
their O
podcast O
focuses O
on O
scrutinizing O
Jones O
and O
his O
tactics, O
Holmes O
said O
the O
trial O
was O
really O
about O
the O
victims. O
“People O
would O
like O
to O
focus O
on O
Alex O
being O
kind O
of O
a O
bombastic O
character O
that O
we O
can O
mock O
and O
make O
fun O
of, O
but O
this O
isn’t O
about O
him,” O
Holmes O
said O
The O
podcast O
format O
allows O
the O
hosts O
to O
go O
beyond O
Jones O
as O
a O
character O
and O
dive O
into O
the O
mechanisms O
of O
what O
he’s O
doing O
and O
why O
these O
conspiracy O
narratives O
exist. O
“We O
approach O
it O
with O
the O
understanding O
that O
it’s O
a O
serious O
topic,” O
Friesen O
said O
“But O
also O
that O
in O
order O
to O
make O
it O
interesting O
for O
anybody O
to O
listen O
to, O
we O
have O
to O
make O
it O
make O
something O
entertaining.” O
Friesen O
has O
listened O
to O
countless O
hours O
of O
Jones O
’ O
program, O
and O
calls O
it O
an O
“incredibly O
boring O
experience.” O
“The O
reason O
that O
I O
do O
this O
is O
because O
I O
can O
stomach O
that O
boredom,” O
Friesen O
said O
He O
endures O
the O
task O
in O
order O
to O
help O
others O
get O
insights O
into O
the O
misinformation O
phenomenon. O
“So O
they O
could O
be O
in O
a O
place O
where O
they O
could O
better O
understand O
what O
Alex O
is O
doing O
and O
what O
he O
brings O
to O
the O
table.” O
Many O
hope O
that O
the O
legal O
and O
financial O
jeopardy O
Jones O
’ O
is O
now O
facing O
will O
help O
curtail O
misinformation O
and O
conspiracy O
culture. O
But O
Friesen O
isn’t O
convinced O
it O
will O
be O
a O
severe O
blow. O
“The O
conspiracy O
producers O
and O
people O
who O
engage O
in O
the O
sorts O
of O
conduct O
that O
Alex O
does O
end O
up O
becoming O
a O
little O
bit O
savvier,” O
Friesen O
said O
“They O
end O
up O
learning O
where O
the O
lines O
are O
… O
of O
what O
they O
can O
do O
and O
what O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with.” O

“ O
It O

that O

that O
this O
was O
a O
local O
problem O
, O
” O
he O
added O
. O
The O
new O
reporting O
comes O
more O
than O
two O
months O
after O
an O
18-year-old O
gunman O
entered O
the O

opened O
fire O
inside O
two O
adjoining O

slaughtered O
19 O

two O

after O
taking O

the O

, O
they O
retreated O

the O

remained O
inside O

a O
total O
of O
77 O

says O
that O

a O
multi-million O

Michael B-PER
López-Alegría I-PER

. O
During O
the O

, O
dubbed O

, O
the O
four-member O
crew O
spent O
nearly O
two O
weeks O
off O

Earth’s O

, O
at O

short O

that O
allow O

a O

Among O
the O
most O
notable O
new O
policies O
for O
these O

missions O
to O
the O
ISS B-ORG
is O
that O
“ O

, O
” O

. O
The O
requirement O
is O
still O
being O

NASA B-ORG
added O
, O

the O

noted O
that O
having O
a O

“ O
provides O
experienced O
guidance O
for O
the O
private O
astronauts O
during O
pre-flight O
preparation O
through O
mission O
execution O
. O
” O
The O
former O
NASA B-ORG
astronaut O
also O
“ O
provides O
a O
link O
” O
between O
residents O
on O
the O
ISS B-ORG
and O
the O
private O
astronauts O
, O
which O
the O
agency O
said O
“ O
reduces O
risk O
” O
to O
ISS B-ORG
operations O
and O
safety O
. O
Late O
last O
year O
, O
SpaceX B-ORG

the O

did O
not O

It O
also O
became O

“ O
NASA B-ORG
was O
a O

been O
there O
before O

” O
“ O

learned O
from O
the O

Future O
private O
missions O
to O
the O

will O
include O
more O

which O
had O
more O
than O
4 O
feet O
of O
water O
in O
it O
during O
the O

. O
“It O
’s O
like O
someone O
turned O

explained O

as O
he O
sat O
on O
the O

out O

“I O

lifted O
up O
off O

as O
they O
washed O
down O

it O

them O
apart O

he O
worries O
that O
this O

the O

“I O
believe O
you O

it O

Some O
are O
also O
concerned O
that O

will O
leave O
the O

the O

“This O
is O
literally O
the O

“These O

you O

I O
don’t O

“It O

a O
role O

, O
echoed O
some O
of O
Montano’s O
sentiments O
. O
“ O
One O
thing O
that O
’s O
consistently O
misunderstood O
and O
that O
doesn’t O
receive O
the O
attention O
it O
needs O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
don’t O
wake O
up O
and O
decide O
to O
be O
vulnerable O
, O
” O
Mwarumba B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O
Often O
, O
when O
we O
try O
to O
address O
people O
in O
their O
communities O
from O
a O
point O
of O
vulnerability O
, O
we O
miss O
the O
systems O
that O
made O
that O
vulnerability O
. O
” O
Miseducation O
, O
historical O
trauma O
in O
Native O
American O
and O
Black O
American O
communities O
, O
marginalization O
and O
disinvestment O
: O
Many O
variables O
compound O
to O
create O
vulnerability O
. O
What O
ought O
to O
happen O
next O
? O
Mwarumba B-PER
explained O
that O
we O
should O
direct O
more O
of O
our O
attention O
– O
our O
knowledge O
, O
our O
data O
– O
toward O
addressing O
some O
of O
these O
root O
causes O
of O
unsafe O
conditions O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
important O
, O
because O
during O
recovery O
, O
you O
want O
to O
think O
about O
not O
only O
the O
immediate O
response O
but O
also O
long-term O
mitigation O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
In O
the O
aftermath O
of O
a O
disaster O
, O
people O
frequently O
say O
that O
they O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
“ O
normal O
. O
” O
That O
impulse O
is O
understandable O
, O
but O
people O
shouldn’t O
strive O
to O
return O
to O
normal O
, O
because O
normal O
was O
the O
problem O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
“ O
You O
want O
to O
rethink O
your O
building O
needs O
, O
” O
Mwarumba B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Because O
if O
you’re O
trying O
to O
quickly O
get O
back O
to O
normal O
, O
what O
that O
means O
is O
that O
you’re O
predisposing O
yourself O
to O
another O
event O
. O
And O
that O
event O
is O
actually O
going O
to O
be O
compounded O
, O
because O
you’re O
going O
to O
be O
dealing O
with O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
event O
you’re O
currently O
going O
through O
. O
” O
In O
other O
words O
, O
disasters O
are O
very O
comprehensive O
, O
as O
CNN B-ORG
’s O
Rachel B-PER
Ramirez I-PER
recently O
stressed O
, O
and O
it O
’s O
vital O
to O
consider O
what O
recovery O
and O
preparedness O
mean O
beyond O
just O
the O
present O
moment O
. O
Montano B-PER
pointed O
out O
the O
significance O
of O
full O
, O
vigorous O
media O
coverage O
. O
“ O
These O
disasters O
aren’t O
one-off O
events O
. O
The O
problems O
we O
see O
in O
Kentucky B-LOC
are O
going O
to O
look O
remarkably O
similar O
to O
the O
problems O
we O
see O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
Missouri B-LOC
and O
anywhere O
else O
affected O
by O
a O
disaster O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
This O
is O
important O
for O
the O
public O
to O
understand O
, O
because O
when O
you O
see O
problems O
come O
up O
again O
and O
again O
, O
that O
means O
these O
are O
systemic O
problems O
. O
” O
Sustaining O
media O
coverage O
matters O
, O
too O
. O
“ O
The O
reporting O
on O
Kentucky B-LOC
is O
going O
to O
drop O
off O
in O
a O
few O
days O
, O

in O
some O
ways O
, O
that O
’s O
when O
the O
disaster O
is O
really O
just O
beginning O
, O
” O
Montano B-PER
said O
. O
The O
recovery O
from O
the O
flooding O
is O
going O
to O
be O
long O
and O
difficult O
. O
It O
’s O
crucial O
that O
media O
outlets O
continue O
to O
cover O
what O
’s O
happening O
and O
hold O
governments O
accountable O
. O
Indeed O
, O
what O
governments O
choose O
to O
do O
, O
or O
refuse O
to O
do O
, O
after O
a O
disaster O
matters O
greatly O
, O
and O
can O
have O
tremendous O
consequences O
for O
the O
people O
at O
the O
center O
of O
an O
extreme O
weather O
event O
. O
“ O
We O
often O
frame O

Arndt B-PER

“ O

it O

an O

a O

Once O
a O

in O
semiconductor O

, O
the O
US B-LOC
has O
lost O
ground O
as O
other O
countries O

up O
production O

forcing O
many O

which O
are O
essential O
to O
the O
production O
of O

it’s O

Wall O

once O

at O
about O
$300 O

a O
number O
on O
par O
with O
many O
Big O

that O
Netflix B-ORG

business O
model O
ultimately O
couldn’t O
live O
up O

Julia B-PER

Netflix B-ORG
was O
never O

a O

Yes O
, O
it O
relied O
on O
subscriber O
growth O
like O
many O
companies O
in O

but O
its O
subscriber O
growth O
was O
built O
on O
having O
films O

TV O
shows O
that O
people O
wanted O
to O
watch O
and O
pay O
for O
. O
That’s O
more O
a O
like O
a O

than O
a O

company O
in O

Netflix B-ORG
looked O
a O

more O

as O

Netflix B-ORG
in O

it O

been O
releasing O
some O

all O

Netflix B-ORG

that O
its O
cheaper O
ad O
tier O
and O
clampdown O
on O

may O
come O
next O

It’s O
partnering O
with O
Microsoft B-ORG

for O
its O
ad O
business O
. O
“I O

in O
many O
ways O
the O

making O

the O
most O
confirmed O
cases O
of O
monkeypox O
on O
the O
planet O
, O
more O
than O
5,000 O
. O
That O
is O
almost O
25% O
of O
the O
global O
numbers O
, O
even O
though O
we O
are O
just O
under O
5% O
of O
the O
world O
’s O
population O
. O
It O
is O
now O
clear O
: O
Preparedness O
alone O
does O
not O
guarantee O
a O
rapid O
response O
. O
With O
Covid-19 O
, O
and O
now O
monkeypox O
, O
we O
were O
too O
slow O
to O
respond O
. O
It O
was O
as O
if O
we O
are O
sitting O
in O
a O
turbo-charged O
Ferrari I-MISC
, O
capable O
of O
massive O
acceleration O
, O
but O
instead O
only O
idling O
in O
the O
driveway O
. O
Cavalry O
culture O
Over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
, O
we O
have O
witnessed O
something O
counterintuitive O
. O
It O
was O
predominantly O
wealthy O
countries O
that O
were O
hit O
hardest O
during O
the O
Covid-19 O
pandemic O
. O
They O
had O
some O
of O
the O
highest O
death O
rates O
, O
despite O
their O
enormous O
resources O
. O
While O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
for O
this O
, O
including O
misinformation O
, O
lack O
of O
public O
trust O
, O
and O
the O
entangling O
of O
public O
health O
and O
politics O
, O
I O
think O
there O
is O
something O
else O
, O
as O
well O
: O
We O
have O
adopted O
what O
I O
call O
a O
“cavalry O
culture O
.” O
We O
wait O
for O
the O
cavalry O
to O
ride O
in O
and O
rescue O
us O
, O
instead O
of O
taking O
smaller O
preventive O
steps O
– O
such O
as O
establishing O
modern O
and O
reliable O
data O
systems O
, O
mastering O
our O
supply O
chain O
along O
the O
way O
, O
and O
acting O
early O
to O
head O
off O
the O
outbreak O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
If O
that O
sounds O
familiar O
, O
it O
’s O
because O
we O
too O
often O
do O
the O
same O
with O
our O
personal O
health O
matters O
. O
According O
to O
research O
published O
in O
the B-MISC
Lancet I-MISC
Public I-MISC
Health I-MISC
, O
nearly O
half O
of O
chronic O
disease O
in O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
is O
mostly O
preventable O
, O
with O
lifestyle O
changes O
. O
Even O
knowing O
that O
, O
however O
, O
the O
medical O
system O
is O
set O
up O
for O
the O
cavalry O
to O
come O
in O
with O
expensive O
medications O
and O
high-tech O
interventions O
, O
instead O
of O
providing O
equitable O
access O
and O
incentives O
for O
preventative O
care O
. O
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
important O
axioms O
in O
public O
health O
. O
One O
is O
, O
by O
the O
time O
you O
think O
you O
must O
act O
to O
contain O
an O
outbreak O
, O
it O
is O
already O
too O
late O
. O
And O
, O
if O
you O
think O
you O
are O
overreacting O
, O
you O
are O
probably O
reacting O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
Covid O
, O
and O
now O
monkeypox O
, O
we O
seem O
to O
have O
forgotten O
those O
basic O
public O
health O
principles O
. O
And O
, O
the O
real O
question O
now O
seems O
to O
be O
: O
When O
will O
the O
government O
finally O
hit O
the O
gas O
pedal O
on O
our O
highly O
tuned O
Ferrari I-MISC
? O
I O
don’t O
want O
to O
suggest O
any O
of O
this O
is O
easy O
. O
There O
are O
significant O
issues O
of O
uncertainty O
and O
unpredictability O
. O
Much O
like O
a O
hurricane O
forming O
at O
sea O
, O
we O
often O
don’t O
know O
exactly O
where O
or O
how O
hard O
it O
will O
hit O
. O
We O
want O
to O
be O
measured O
, O
calm O
in O
our O
response O
and O
to O
cause O
as O
little O
disruption O
as O
possible O
. O
We O
want O
to O
be O
thoughtful O
and O
gather O
as O
much O
information O
as O
is O
available O
. O
And O
therein O
lies O
one O
of O
our O
biggest O
problems O
: O
basic O
data O
. O
I O
have O
often O
wondered O
, O
how O
is O
it O
that O
a O
numbers-driven O
, O
high-tech O
country O
like O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
can’t O
get O
basic O
data O
right O
? O
Data O
disaster O
As O
long O
as O
I O
’ve O
been O
reporting O
on O
the O
Covid O
pandemic O
, O
I O
have O
always O
had O
to O
offer O
the O
caveat O
that O
case O
numbers O
are O
probably O
off O
, O
sometimes O
wildly O
so O
. O
We O
have O
probably O
never O
had O
a O
clear O
vision O
on O
just O
how O
widely O
the O
virus O
was O
spreading O
at O
any O
given O
time O
in O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
and O
going O
into O
the O
fall O
2022 O
, O
the O
situation O
is O
n’t O
really O
any O
better O
. O
In O
early O
July O
, O
the O
Institute I-ORG
for O
Health O
Metrics O
, O
a O
research O
center O
at O
the O
University I-LOC
of O
Washington I-LOC
, O
released O
a O
model O
suggesting O
that O
actual O
Covid-19 O
cases O
are O
seven O
times O
higher O
than O
reported O
cases O
. O
At O
times O
, O
it O
seems O
the O
tech O
platforms O
for O
Snapchat O
and O
Twitter O
offer O
more O
data O
analytics O
than O
the O
patchwork O
of O
state O
and O
federal O
systems O
that O
underpin O
the O
public O
health O
of O
our O
country O
. O
“First O
, O
there O
’s O
a O
lack O
of O
data O
access O
needed O
to O
understand O
where O
disease O
outbreaks O
are O
spreading O
. O
This O
is O
due O
to O
data O
collection O
limitations O
that O
Congress O
needs O
to O
fix O
,” O
said O
Dr. O
Tom I-PER
Frieden I-PER
, O
president O
and O
CEO O
of O
Resolve O
to O
Save O
Lives O
and O
a O
former O
director O
of O
the O
US I-ORG
Centers I-ORG
for O
Disease O
Control O
and O
Prevention I-ORG
. O
He O
said O
there O
is O
also O
a O
need O
to O
update O
analog O
systems O
and O
connect O
them O
to O
each O
other O
– O
getting O
them O
to O
speak O
the O
same O
language O
. O
Right O
now O
, O
it O
’s O
the O
Tower O
of O
Babel O
. O
“Second O
, O
we O
lack O
sufficient O
numbers O
and O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
skills O
of O
people O
and O
systems O
at O
the O
federal O

that O
can O
deliver O

Finally O
, O
we O
are O
in O
perpetual O
panic O

he O
said O
. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
all O
of O
the O
things O
Frieden O
is O
describing O
, O
our O
current O
data O
collection O
and O
reporting O
system O
leaves O
important O
information O
fractured O
into O
dozens O
of O
states O
and O
territories O
, O
and O
thousands O
of O
county O
pieces O
for O
the O
CDC I-ORG

puzzle O
together O
. O
“I O
have O
been O
struck O
as O
we O
at O
CDC O
are O
now O
conquering O
another O
public O
health O
challenge O
– O
monkeypox O
– O
as O
to O
how O
little O
authority O
we O
at O
CDC O
have O
to O
receive O
the O
data O
,” O
CDC O
Director O
Dr. O
Rochelle I-PER
Walensky I-PER
told O
the O
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
. O
Walensky O
is O
talking O
about O
basic O
data O
, O
like O
where O
the O
vaccine O
has O
gone O
, O
who O
has O
been O
vaccinated O
, O
whether O
the O
vaccine O
is O
working O
, O
and O
even O
monkeypox O
case O
data O
like O
who O
is O
getting O
infected O
, O
their O
age O
and O
race/ethnicity O
. O
Why O
might O
this O
be O
so O
? O
“States O
don’t O
routinely O
share O
vaccine O
doses O
administered O
data O
with O
the O
federal O
government O
– O
Covid O
was O
really O
the O
first O
time O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
successfully O
put O

use O
agreements O
in O

Claire O
Hannan O
, O
the O
executive O
director O
of O
the B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of O
Immunization O
Managers I-ORG
, O
told O
CNN I-ORG
. O
Part O
of O
the O
reason O
is O
because O
“states O
have O
laws O
in O
place O
to O
protect O
identifiable O
information O
.” O
Some O
information O
has O
been O
getting O
to O
the O
CDC I-ORG
, O
but O
it O
is O
challenging O
to O
get O
and O
incomplete O
. O
The O
CDC I-ORG
director O
told O
the O
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
, O
“We O
have O
been O
speaking O
to O
our O
state O
and O
local O
partners O
probably O
at O
least O
three O
times O
a O
week O
, O
all O
of O
them O
. O
… O
That O
is O
not O
how O
you O
synthesize O
data O
. O
We O
need O
… O
standardization O
of O
those O
data O
, O
and O
we O
need O
to O
have O
those O
data O
come O
to O
us O
in O
a O
standardized O
fashion O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
connected O
, O
we O
can O
compile O
them O
and O
rapidly O
report O
them O
out O
. O
We O
cannot O
at O
CDC O
collect O
the O
data O
and O
make O
informed O
decisions O
by O
calling O
64 O
jurisdictions O
, O
and O
honestly O
, O
3,000 O
counties O
.” O
The O
CDC I-ORG
is O
currently O
working O
on O
agreements O
that O
would O
broaden O
the O
agency O
’s O
access O
to O
states’ O
data O
, O
as O
they O
successfully O
did O
with O
Covid O
. O
Hannan O
explained O
, O
“The O
need O
to O
quickly O
get O
the O
[monkeypox] O
vaccine O
out O
left O
no O
time O
to O
get O
data O
sharing O
agreements O
in O
place O
.” O
But O
even O
if O
those O
agreements O
were O
in O
place O
, O
it O
still O
doesn’t O
mean O
the O
states’ O
ability O
to O
actually O
obtain O
vaccine O
doses O
would O
be O
made O
any O
easier O
. O
That O
’s O
because O
the O
states O
would O
n’t O
be O
using O
the O
same O
data O
system O
for O
ordering O
and O
tracking O
doses O
they O
generally O
use O
. O
Because O
the O
US I-ORG
Department I-ORG
of O
Health I-ORG
and O
Human I-ORG
Services I-ORG
and O
the O
Administration I-ORG
for O
Strategic I-ORG
Preparedness I-ORG
and O
Response I-ORG
are O
in O
charge O
of O
monkeypox O
vaccine O
distribution O
, O
there O
would O
be O
yet O
another O
data O
system O
involved O
. O
“They O
were O
asking O
states O
to O
request O
the O
vaccine O
using O
paper O
forms O
and O
email O
,” O
said O
Hannan O
. O
“They O
were O
asking O
states O
to O
complete O
forms O
[with O
fillable O
fields O
] O
on O
those O
who O
were O
receiving O
the O
vaccine O
and O
return O
these O
forms O
to O
the O
federal O
government O
.” O
The O
problem O
was O
there O
weren’t O
even O
the O
right O
fields O
for O
the O
specific O
questions O
being O
asked O
, O
such O
as O
reason O
for O
vaccination O
or O
type O
of O
exposure O
or O
risk O
, O
Hannan O
said O
. O
It O
wasn’t O
that O
the O
necessary O
forms O
weren’t O
being O
filled O
out O
, O
it O
was O
that O
they O
couldn’t O
be O
filled O
out O
because O
of O
disparate O
data O
platforms O
. O
It O
is O
a O
baffling O
level O
of O
bureaucracy O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
unfolding O
outbreak O
. O
Testing O
, O
vaccines O
, O
therapeutics O
As O
things O
stand O
now O
, O
the O
issues O
with O
data O
collection O
, O
testing O
, O
vaccines O
, O
treatments O
and O
communication O
are O
sounding O
a O
lot O
like O
the O
ones O
we O
experienced O
with O
Covid-19 O
. O
But O
, O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
monkeypox O
is O
not O
that O
much O
like O
Covid O
. O
For O
now O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
spread O
primarily O
through O
sores O
or O
lesions O
during O
close O
, O
personal O
touch O
and O
shared O
objects O
like O
towels O
and O
linens O
, O
as O
well O
as O
respiratory O
secretions O
during O
prolonged O
face-to-face O
contact O
. O
The O
monkeypox O
outbreak O
is O
also O
different O
for O
another O
fundamental O
reason O
. O
Unlike O
with O
Covid O
, O
which O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
novel O
virus O
, O
the O
basic O
tools O
already O
exist O
either O
for O
monkeypox O
or O
its O
close O
relative O
, O
smallpox O
. O
We O
didn’t O
have O
to O
build O
them O
from O
scratch O
. O
That O
means O
we O
could O
have O
had O
them O
or O
put O
them O
to O
better O
use O
by O
now O
. O
Take O
testing O
. O
At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
outbreak O
, O
testing O
capability O
was O
capped O
at O
about O
6,000 O
tests O
per O
week O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
doctors O
really O
had O
to O
ration O
them O
to O
a O
narrow O
group O
of O
people O
– O
primarily O
a O
subset O
of O
men O
who O
have O
sex O
with O
men O
. O
Since O
then O
, O
the O
CDC I-ORG
has O
partnered O
with O
five O
labs O
to O
scale O
up O
our O
capabilities O
and O
we O
should O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
process O
up O
to O
80,000 O
tests O
a O
week O
. O
But O
the O
tests O
are O
being O
underutilized O
, O
according O
to O
CNN I-ORG
reporting O
. O
Experts O
blamed O
the O
low O
uptake O
on O
several O
factors O
, O
including O
a O
lack O
of O
awareness O
among O
doctors O
about O
the O
virus O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
stigma O
among O
patients O
. O
So O
, O
just O
as O
with O
Covid O
, O
the O
real O
scope O
of O
the O
monkeypox O
outbreak O
is O
probably O
underappreciated O
. O
Confirmed O
or O
probable O
cases O
stand O
around O
5,000 O
, O
according O
to O
CDC I-ORG
data O
, O
but O
the O
number O
could O
be O
several O
fold O
higher O
. O
Another O
tool O
that O
could O
be O
tremendously O
helpful O
is O
testing O
of O
wastewater O
. O
As O
we O
have O
seen O
with O
Covid O
, O
it O
can O
better O
define O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
outbreak O
and O
where O
it O
will O
emerge O
next O
. O
Two O
months O
into O
the O
outbreak O
, O
we O
still O
aren’t O
doing O
this O
widely O
for O
monkeypox O
. O
And O
then O
there O
are O
vaccines O
. O
Unlike O
Covid O
, O
where O
we O
spent O
upward O
of O
$20 O
billion O
to O
develop O
, O
test O
and O
distribute O
vaccines O
, O
we O
already O
have O
a O
vaccine O
specifically O
approved O
for O
monkeypox O
. O
Supplies O
were O
limited O
and O
the O
initial O
US I-LOC
vaccination O
strategy O
focused O
on O
known O
monkeypox O
cases O
and O
their O
immediate O
contacts O
. O
But O
the O
outbreak O
continued O
to O
grow O
, O
and O
the O
strategy O
had O
to O
change O
. O
The O
count O
of O
people O
eligible O
for O
the O
two-dose O
Jynneos O
vaccine O
has O
now O
expanded O
to O
an O
estimated O
1.5 O
million O
. O
With O
that O
same O
cavalry O
culture O
, O
we O
are O
woefully O
behind O
in O
getting O
those O
doses O
to O
people O
who O
want O
them O
. O
At O
this O
time O
, O
only O
336,710 O
doses O
have O
been O
shipped O
to O
states O
. O
Ordering O
only O
just O
began O
for O
about O
800,000 O
more O
doses O
. O
This O
scarcity O
has O
created O
long O
lines O
in O
monkeypox O
hotspots O
like O
New I-LOC
York I-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
which O
has O
the O
highest O
number O
of O
cases O
in O
the O
country O
. O
It O
also O
means O
that O
the O
vaccine O
, O
which O
can O
be O
given O
within O
14 O
days O
of O
exposure O
(but O
preferably O
within O
four O
) O
to O
prevent O
or O
reduce O
the O
severity O
of O
disease O
, O
is O
currently O
being O
used O
more O
as O
a O
treatment O
– O
a O
post-exposure O
prophylaxis O
– O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
real O
preventive O
measure O
. O
As O
National I-PER
Institute I-PER
of O
Allergy I-PER
and O
Infectious I-PER
Diseases I-PER
Director O
Dr. O
Anthony I-PER
Fauci I-PER
said O
on O
CNN I-ORG
, O
that O
focus O
will O
have O
to O
shift O
. O
“It O
’s O
very O
clear O
with O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
that O
there O
now O
has O
to O
be O
a O
balance O
between O
vaccines O
available O
for O
those O
who O
clearly O
have O
been O
exposed O
, O

Fauci O
said O

“What O
you O
want O
to O
do O
is O
a O
balance O
between O
vaccinating O
those O
who O
clearly O
have O
had O
an O
exposure O
but O
go O
well O
beyond O
that O
.” O
It O
’s O
a O
missed O
opportunity O
that O
won’t O
be O
rectified O
immediately O
, O
even O
with O
the O
soon-to-arrive O
786,000 O
doses O
announced O
by O
HHS I-ORG
this O

. O
Needs O
will O
still O
outstrip O
supply O
. O
Finally O
, O
there O
is O
the O
issue O
of O
treatment O
. O
The O
CDC I-ORG
has O
made O
the O
antiviral O
smallpox O
treatment O
tecovirimat O
, O
called O
TPOXX O
, O
available O
to O
monkeypox O
patients O
who O
have O
or O
are O
at O
high O
risk O
of O
severe O
disease O
under O
an O
“alternate O
regulatory O
mechanism O
.” O
There O
are O
1.7 O
million O
courses O
of O
TPOXX O
stockpiled O
. O
But O
once O
again O
, O
getting O
the O
medication O
to O
patients O
who O
could O
immediately O
benefit O
has O
proven O
to O
be O
bureaucratically O
burdensome O
for O
both O
patients O
and O
providers O
. O
“You’re O
talking O
about O
a O
five O
, O
six O
-day O
time O
lag O
to O
get O
that O
medication O
to O
you O
at O
a O
local O
doctor’s O
office O
, O
no O
matter O
where O
you O
are O
. O
And O
the O
paperwork O
, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
bureaucracy O
to O
make O
that O
happen O
is O
very O
cumbersome O
, O
takes O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
your O

And O
that’s O
the O
barrier O

Fortunately O

those O

were O
loosened O
somewhat O
last O

allowing O

though O
most O
cases O
are O
“mild O

they O
are O
still O
uncomfortable O
, O
or O
downright O
painful O
, O
depending O
on O
where O
sores O
appear O
. O
Plus O
, O
there O
is O
a O
risk O
of O
long-term O
complications O
if O
the O
pox O
lesions O
develop O
in O
areas O
around O
the O
eye O
or O
GI O

All O
of O
these O
gaps O
have O
the O
hardest O
hit O
community O
on O

“Largely O
public O
health O
officials O
know O
how O
this O
has O

know O
how O

“We O

the O

no O

But O
, O
I O
do O
worry O
that O
we O
once O

waited O
too O
long O

We O
sat O
idling O

perhaps O
not O

that O
somehow O
we O
had O
suddenly O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O

of O
yet O
another O
outbreak O

I O
remember O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
a O
case O
of O
monkeypox O
– O
it O
was O
in O
2008 O
, O
in O
the B-LOC

the I-LOC
Congo I-LOC
, O
one O
of O
the O

Africa O
where O
the O
disease O
is O
endemic O
. O
To O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
see O
it O
in O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
. O
After O
all O
, O
it O
was O
a O
virus O
that O
hadn’t O
traveled O
much O
since O
it O
was O
first O
identified O
in O
DRC O
in O
1970 O
. O
My O
guess O
was O
that O
most O
of O
my O
medical O
colleagues O
in O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
would O
likely O
only O
see O
pictures O
of O
the O
distinctive O

The O
world O

however O
, O

changing O

twice O

We O
have O
learned O

lessons O
in O
the O
last O
few O

and O
we O
are O
now O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
our O
first O
significant O
test O
since O
the O
Covid O

began O
, O
to O
see O
if O
we O
do O
any O
better O
this O
time O
around O
. O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
we O
are O
capable O
, O
and O
we O
are O
prepared O

The O
question O
is O
will O
we O
use O
all O
those O
remarkable O
resources O

respond O

or O
we O
will O
wait O

eventually O

spent O
more O

As O
the O
two O

turn O
their O

on O
each O

, O
Wisconsin B-LOC
represents O
yet O
another O
example O
of O
a O
high O
stakes O
Senate O

the O
contrast O

‘The O

The O
Barnes I-PER
strategy O
is O
to O
define O
Johnson I-PER
as O
a O
changed O
man O
, O
someone O
who O
went O
to O
Washington B-LOC
as O
an O
insurgent O
candidate O

then O
enmeshed O
himself O
into O
the O
Republican O
Party O
led O
by O
former O
President O
Donald I-PER
Trump I-PER
. O
The O
attacks O
will O
include O
Johnson I-PER
’s O
own O
admission O
that O
the O
2017 O
tax O
bill O
passed O
by O
Republicans O
in O
Washington B-LOC
benefited O
his O
own O
company O

his O

role O
in O
attempting O
to O
push O
a O
slate O
of O
fake O
electors O
after O
the O
2020 O
election O
; O
and O
his O
more O
recent O
suggestion O
that O

two O
popular O
social O
spending O
programs O

something O
experts O
argue O
could O
effectively O
end O
the O
programs O

“What O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
we O
ought O
to O
turn O
everything O
into O
discretionary O
spending O

that O
it O

all O
evaluated O

that O
we O
can O
fix O
problems O
or O
fix O
programs O
that O
are O
broken O
that O
are O
going O
to O
be O
going O
bankrupt O
,” O
Johnson I-PER
said O
earlier O
this O
month O
. O
Barnes I-PER
wasted O
no O
time O
jumping O
on O
the O
comment O
, O
using O
it O
to O
argue O
that O
Johnson I-PER
’s O
personal O
wealth O
makes O
it O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
understand O
what O
these O
programs O
mean O
to O
working O

people O
. O
“If O
he O
wants O
be O
anti-Social O
Security O
, O
that’s O
on O
him O
,” O
Barnes I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
using O
the O
Johnson I-PER
comment O
to O
inoculate O
himself O
from O
Republican O
charges O
of O
being O
too O
extreme O
. O
“That’s O
much O
more O
extreme O
than O
wanting O
working O

a O

shot O
.” O
With O
the O
primary O
all O
but O
decided O
, O
Barnes I-PER
put O
out O
an O
attack O
ad O
earlier O
this O
month O
that O
hit O
Johnson I-PER
on O
outsourcing O
jobs O
, O
using O
the O
senator’s O
defense O
of O
a O
company O
that O
took O
jobs O
out O

“Ron I-PER

be O
more O
out O
of O
touch O
with O

the O
ad O
says O
. O
Democrats O
are O
also O
preparing O
to O
paint O
Johnson I-PER
as O
a O
candidate O
who O
has O
become O
a O
conspiracy O
theory O
promoter O
, O
including O
questioning O
the O
push O
to O
vaccinate O
people O
against O
the O
coronavirus O
, O
calling O

“bullsh*t O

that O

on O

operatives O

campaigns O
acknowledged O
the O
impact O
some O
of O
Johnson I-PER

comments O
have O
had O
on O
his O
image O

A O
recent O

one O

argued O
that O

over O
the O
summer O

“it O

see O
negative O
views O
of O
Johnson I-PER
as O
central O
to O
their O
plan O
of O
turning O
the O
general O
election O
into O
a O

of O
the O

“Ron I-PER

‘Defined O

The O
attacks O
on O
Barnes I-PER
center O
on O
accusations O
that O
he O
is O
too O
extreme O
for O
the O

, O
using O
his O
time O
as O
a O
community O

from O

runs O
for O

The O
hits O

the O
“Squad O

believes O
are O
too O
“extreme O

for O
Wisconsin B-LOC

Barnes I-PER
has O
said O
he O
does O
not O
support O
abolishing O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
Immigration O

Customs O

but O
supports O
“addressing O

Voelkel I-PER
said O
. O
One O
issue O
that O
Barnes I-PER
’ O
campaign O
must O
confront O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
polls O
show O
that O
many O
Wisconsin B-LOC

don’t O
know O
enough O
about O
him O
to O
have O
an O
opinion O

something O
that O
can O
be O
both O
helpful O

hurtful O

“Barnes I-PER

And O
they O
plan O
to O
do O
just O
that O
, O
with O
the O
Johnson I-PER
campaign O
and O
outside O
groups O
already O
gearing O
up O
to O
cast O
Barnes I-PER

out O

about O

Barnes I-PER
responded O
to O
these O
attacks O
by O
saying O

“tried O
to O
say O
the O

thing O
about O

she O
went O

to O
win O
the O
state’s O
other O
Senate O
seat O
in O
2012 O
and O
reelection O
in O
2018 O

“People O

behavior O

he O
said O
. O
‘We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O

The O
question O
among O
experts O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
is O
whether O
, O
after O
years O
of O
polarization O
and O
remarkably O
tight O
elections O
, O
there O
are O
even O
enough O
persuadable O
voters O
in O
the O
state O
to O
make O
the O
general O
election O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
base-focused O
race O
. O
Wisconsin B-LOC
has O
been O
a O
swing O
state O
for O
years O
. O
When O
Trump I-PER
won O
it O
in O
2016 O
, O
he O
was O
the O
first O
Republican O
to O
win O
it O
since O
1984 O
. O
While O
Biden I-PER
won O
the O
state O
back O
in O
2020 O
, O
the O
state O
has O
long O
had O
years O
of O
Republican O
governors O
, O
including O
Scott I-PER
Walker I-PER
from O
2011 O
to O
2019 O
, O
and O
Republicans O
control O
both O
chambers O
of O
the O
state O
legislature O
. O
“We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool O
,” O
said O
Joe I-PER
Zepecki I-PER
, O
a O
Democratic O
operative O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
fights O
around O
union O
rights O
in O
2011 O
and O
2012 O
led O
to O
the O
state O
being O
deeply O
polarized O
long O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
Donald I-PER
Trump I-PER
. O
“So O
that O
shrinking O
segment O
of O
swing O
voters O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
ball O
game O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
political O
environment O
may O
be O
bad O
, O
but O
Republicans’ O
brand O
is O
rotten O
with O
those O
voters O

This O
is O
why O
political O
watchers O
like O
Franklin I-PER
and O
others O
expect O
a O
deluge O
of O
negative O
ads O
in O
the O
contest O

with O
both O
sides O
running O
campaigns O
that O
“reflect O
that O
polarization O
that O
we O
have O
had O
for O
a O
good O
12 O
years O

Democrats O
are O
confident O
that O
if O
they O
can O
turn O
the O
race O
into O
a O
referendum O
on O
Johnson I-PER
, O
there O
are O
enough O
votes O

have O
backed O
him O
in O
the O
past O

are O
ready O
for O
an O

“There O
is O

up O

While O
he O
did O

he O
will O

“This O

TerraUSD B-MISC
(UST) I-MISC
, O
a O
so-called O
stablecoin O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
trade O
at O
$1 O
, O
saw O
its O
price O
fall O
well O

The O
underlying O
problem O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
risky O
lending O
, O
poor O
risk O
management O
and O
opaque O
finances O
. O
So O
when O
crypto O
prices O
crashed O
, O
likely O
as O
a O
result O
of O
fears O
of O
rising O
inflation O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
recession O
, O
some O
crypto O
companies O
didn’t O
have O
the O
capital O
to O
cushion O
the O
blow. O
The O
result O
has O
been O
the O
disappearance O
of O
billions O
of O
dollars O
in O
value O
, O
often O
with O
ordinary O
investors O
paying O
the O
price O
. O
Cryptocurrencies O
like O
Bitcoin O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
independent O
of O
any O
government O
. O
But O
we O
have O
now O
reached O
the O
point O
where O
stronger O
government O
regulation O
of O
the O
crypto O
industry O
is O
both O
necessary O
and O
inevitable O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
industry O
can’t O
just O
wait O
for O
the O
government O
to O
act O
. O
Crypto O
companies O
must O
also O
try O
to O
better O
police O
themselves O
. O
That O
starts O
with O
providing O
more O
transparency O
. O
While O
transparency O
is O
one O
of O
the O
core O
ideals O
of O
blockchain O
technology O
— O
all O
transactions O
on O
the O
Bitcoin O
blockchain O
are O
viewable O
for O
the O
world O
to O
see O
, O
for O
example O
— O
some O
crypto O
companies O
are O
strikingly O
opaque O

In O
the O
case O

Cynthia B-PER

Hester B-PER
Peirce I-PER
, O
a O
commissioner O
at O
the O
SEC B-ORG
, O
has O
long O
argued O
for O
more O
regulatory O
clarity O
. O
“If O
we O
decided O
that O
crypto O
lending O
is O
an O
area O
that O
we O
can O
implicate O
the O

laws O
, O
we O
could O
have O
sat O
down O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
and O
hammered O
out O
some O
rules O
around O
that O
that O
made O
sense O
,” O
she O
said O
in O
an O
interview O
, O
speaking O
in O
her O
personal O
capacity O
. O
Instead O
, O
what O
you O
often O
get O
is O
regulation O
by O
enforcement O
, O
where O
companies O
are O
punished O
after O
the O
fact O
. O
One O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
these O
one-off O
enforcement O
actions O
is O
that O
they O
don’t O
necessarily O
cover O
the O
whole O
crypto O
landscape O
. O
“Not O
only O
is O
that O
not O
particularly O
fair O
, O
because O
sometimes O
enforcement O
actions O
come O
late O
, O
and O
sometimes O
it’s O
a O
question O
of O
‘why O
did O
you O
go O
after O
this O
project O
instead O
of O
this O
project O
,’ O
but O
also O
because O
it O
allows O
people O
who O
are O
really O
doing O
bad O
things O
to O
get O
lost O
in O
the O
shuffle O
,” O
Peirce B-PER
said O
. O
These O
proposals O
are O
all O
steps O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
for O
starting O
a O
serious O
conversation O
about O
crypto O
regulation O
. O
But O
given O
other O
priorities O
in O
Washington O
, O
it’s O
unclear O
when O
new O
regulations O
would O
take O
effect O
or O
what O
they O
will O
look O
like O
in O
their O
final O
form O
. O
Smart O
regulation O
is O
necessary O
, O
but O
it O
won’t O
be O
enough O
. O
Crypto O
innovation O
moves O
faster O
than O
any O
government’s O
attempt O
to O
rein O
it O
in O
. O
Political O
negotiations O
can O
also O
delay O
the O
passage O
of O
bills O
. O
Furthermore O
, O
with O
every O
new O
crisis O
, O
cryptocurrency O
loses O
more O
credibility O
. O
This O
could O
lead O
regulators O
to O
crack O
down O
harder O
than O
they O
would O
have O
otherwise O
, O
stifling O
innovation O
in O
a O
still-evolving O
field O
. O
An O
industry O
that O
prides O
itself O
on O
decentralization O
shouldn’t O
rely O
on O
the O
government O
to O
save O
it O
from O

at O
Sandy B-LOC
Hook I-LOC

spin O
lurid O
conspiracies O
that O
the O
shootings O
never O
happened O
and O
that O
the O
shattered O

were O
simply O
actors. O
The O
conspiracy O
triggered O
years O

harassment O

targeted O
the O

who O
have O
had O

apologized O

was O

the O

within O

Jones B-PER

That O

did O
, O
such O
as O
the O

conspiracy O
of O
2015. O
Jones B-PER
turned O
the O
routine O

exercise O
in O

a O

that O
it O
was O
a O
covert O
government O
effort O
to O
prepare O

That O

quickly O
escaped O

Sen. O
Ted B-PER

of O

, O
preparing O

also O
legitimated O

been O
assured O
by O
the O

that O

a O

exercise O
, O
“ O
I O
understand O
the O
reason O
for O
concern O
and O
uncertainty O
, O
because O
when O
the O
federal O
government O
has O
not O
demonstrated O
itself O
to O
be O
trustworthy O
in O
this O
administration O
, O
the O
natural O
consequence O
is O
that O
many O
citizens O
don’t O
trust O
what O
it O
is O

” O
Cruz B-PER
’s O
pivot O
helps O
explain O
why O
the O
space O
between O
Jones B-PER
and O
the O
GOP O
collapsed O
in O
the O
2010s. O
The O
Republican B-ORG
Party I-ORG
spent O
decades O
arguing O
that O
government O
was O
corrupt, O
if O
not O
illegitimate O
, O
and O
grew O
increasingly O
reliant O
on O
right-wing O
media O
for O
the O
party’s O
messaging O
. O
So O
, O
it O
took O
very O
little O
effort O
to O
tip O
over O
into O
the O
world O
of O
wild O
conspiracies O
– O
especially O
once O
, O
with O
the O
election O
of O
Trump B-PER
, O
Republicans O
realized O
there O
would O
be O
no O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
doing O
so O
. O
The O
last O
few O
years O
have O
suggested O
that O
the O
bill O
is O
coming O
due O
– O
Trump B-PER
lost O
the O
presidency O
and O
the O
Congress O
, O
Jones B-PER
lost O
his O
defamation O
trial O
and O
several O
right-wing O
media O
outlets O
are O
facing O
hefty O
defamation O
suits O
for O
their O
election O
conspiracies O
. O
That O
hasn’t O
yet O
curbed O
the O
party’s O
conspiracy-mongering O
, O
though O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Alex B-PER

His O
conspiratorial O
thinking O
, O
rhetoric O
and O
style O
are O
now O
well-integrated O
in O
the O
Republican B-ORG

indicate O
the O
audience O
was O
confused O
about O
whether O
the O
story O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
funny O
or O
merely O
a O
reflection O
of O
Alito’s O
seemingly O
low O
opinion O
of O
Prince B-PER
Harry I-PER
, O
Duke O
of O
Sussex O
. O
Alito’s O
comments O
about O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
and O
the O
Duke O
of O
Sussex O
were O
inappropriate O
for O
any O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
Justice O
speaking O
in O
a O
foreign O
country O
or, O
for O
that O
matter, O
even O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O
The O
court O
usually O
declines O
ruling O
on O
issues O
that O
involve O
foreign O
policy O
as O
the O
Constitution O
generally O
leaves O
these O
matters O
exclusively O
to O
the O
president, O
with O
the O
occasional O
advice O
and O
consent O
of O
Congress. O
There O
is O
no O
mention O
in O
the O
Constitution O
of O
roving O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
Justices O
attacking O
foreign O
leaders O
who O
disagree O
with O
the O
court’s O
pronouncements. O
This O
is O
a O
critical O
time O
for O
the O
reputation O
and O
stability O
of O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
, O
given O
the O
substantial O
anger O
expressed O
by O
many O
Americans O
concerning O
the O
reversal O
of O
Roe B-MISC
v. O
Wade B-MISC
after O
49 O
years. O
There O
have O
been O
“court-packing” O
proposals O
supported O
by O
many O
in O
Congress. O
Both O
House O
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi I-PER
and O
President B-PER
Joe I-PER
Biden I-PER
have O
suggested O
a O
commission O
to O
study O
the O
idea. O
The O
proposal O
would O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
justices, O
thereby O
diluting O
the O
power O
of O
the O
court’s O
current O
conservative O
wing. O
With O
his O
speech O
in O
Rome, O
Alito B-PER
demonstrated O
that O
he O
is O
no O
Antonin B-PER
Scalia I-PER
, O
whose O
wit O
and O
charm O
in O
public O
speaking O
appearances O
impressed O
many, O
including O
even O
those O
who O
disagreed O
with O
his O
conservative O
politics. O
Lots O
of O
Americans O
were O
undoubtedly O
surprised O
that O
Alito O
or O
any O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
justice O
would O
be O
permitted O
to O
make O
public O
comments O
about O
a O
recent O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
decision. O
Televised O
congressional O
hearings O
concerning O
nominees O
appointed O
to O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
have O
schooled O
Americans O
that O
they O
will O
always O
decline O
or O
deflect O
direct O
answers O
relating O
to O
any O
issue O
that O
may O
come O
before O
the O
court. O
At O
his O
own O
confirmation O
hearing O
in O
2006, O
Alito B-PER
deflected O
questions O
about O
Roe B-MISC
v. O
Wade B-MISC
with O
a O
version O
of O
an O
answer O
given O
by O
many O
other O
conservative O
nominees O
to O
the O
court O
saying O
that O
the O
decision O
was O
“an O
important O
precedent O
of O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
” O
and O
“it O
has O
been O
on O
the O
books O
for O
a O
long O
time.” O
This O
answer O
was O
then O
supplemented O
by O
an O
Alito B-PER
comment O
suggesting O
that O
he O
wouldn’t O
pre-commit O
to O
his O
position O
on O
future O
cases O
because O
he O
wouldn’t O
want O
any O
litigant O
to O
believe O
he O
had O
already O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
about O
a O
case O
without O
first O
hearing O
the O
facts. O
Many O
Americans O
were O
probably O
shocked O
to O
hear O
a O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
justice O
making O
a O
public O
speech O
of O
any O
kind. O
Although O
the O
justices O
do O
occasionally O
make O
public O
speeches, O
they O
are O
normally O
scrupulous O
in O
avoiding O
any O
discussion O
of O
issues O
related O
to O
pending O
or O
prospective O
cases. O
And O
issues O
regarding O
abortion O
are O
always O
on O
the O
docket O
of O
federal O
courts O
across O
the O
nation O
on O
their O
potential O
journey O
to O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O
The O
Dobbs B-MISC
v. O
Jackson B-MISC
case O
will O
not O
end O
litigation O
concerning O
the O
nuances O
of O
abortion-related O
laws O
throughout O
the O
nation. O
Public O
confidence O
in O
the O
court O
does O
not O
require O
justices O
to O
avoid O
all O
speech-making, O
but O
it O
does O
require O
them O
to O
be O
sensible O
and O
discreet O
in O
the O
topics O
they O
choose. O
Alito B-PER
has O
demonstrated O
extraordinarily O
bad O
judgment O
in O
discussing O
the O
Roe B-MISC
v. O
Wade B-MISC
controversy O
in O
a O
foreign O
nation, O
even O
in O
jest, O
while O
cases O
related O
to O
the O
abortion O
issue O
are O
pending O
in O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O
Discussions O
concerning O
this O
important O
issue O
by O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
justices O
should O
take O
place O
in O
open O
and O
public O
American O
courtrooms O
rather O
than O
before O
a O
private O
group O
in O
the O
auditorium O

Slone B-PER

her O

an O

all O
that’s O
left O

after O
the O
recent O

“Ya O

The O

She O
asks O
if O

her O

she O

but O
the O

tells O
her O
not O

She O
also O
mentions O
that O
she O

the O

fortunate O

can O
afford O
to O
take O
time O
off O
to O
care O
for O
more O

Many O
people O
in O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
were O
already O
struggling O
when O
disaster O
struck O
, O
and O
the O
needs O
right O
now O
are O
vast O
and O
urgent O
. O
In O
a O
region O
long O
derided O
and O
dismissed O
by O
outsiders O
, O
Slone B-PER
and O
others O
in O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
know O
their O
neighbors O
can’t O
count O
on O
support O
to O
come O
from O
elsewhere O
. O
So O
they O
’re O
doing O
what O
they O
’ve O
always O
done O
: O
Helping O
one O
another O
survive O
. O
People O
here O
were O
already O
struggling O
The O
homes O
and O
livelihoods O
wiped O
away O
by O
the O
flooding O
were O
already O
on O
shaky O
ground O
. O
After O
cycles O
of O
boom O
and O
bust O
over O
the O
last O
century O
, O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
’s O
coal O
industry O
has O
declined O
steeply O
since O
the O
’80s O
as O
companies O
laid O
off O
workers O
in O
favor O
of O
automation O
and O
mechanization O
. O
As O
demand O
for O
alternative O
energy O
sources O
increased O
and O
coal O
became O
less O
profitable O
to O
mine O
, O
many O
of O
the O
region’s O
workers O
were O
out O
of O
a O
job O
. O
The O
miners O
who O
were O
still O
employed O
were O
prescribed O
opiates O
for O
pain O
from O
their O
injuries O
, O
a O
phenomenon O
that O
helped O
give O
rise O
to O
the O
ongoing O
opioid O
epidemic O
. O
After O
decades O
of O
disinvestment O
in O
the O
region O
, O
parts O
of O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
are O
experiencing O
an O
exodus O

Knott B-LOC
County I-LOC
and O
Letcher B-LOC
County I-LOC
, O
two O
of O
the O
areas O
hit O
hardest O
by O
the O
floods O
, O
saw O
their O
populations O
decline O
by O
about O
12% O
each O
between O
2010 O
and O
2020 O
, O
according O
to O
data O
from O
the O
US B-ORG
Census I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
. O
Poverty O
rates O
in O
counties O
across O
the O
region O
are O
more O
than O
twice O
the O
national O
average O
, O
and O
unemployment O
rates O
are O
similarly O
grim O
. O
Those O
conditions O
translate O
to O
a O
shrinking O
tax O
base O
, O
providing O
local O
governments O
little O
funding O
to O
improve O
infrastructure O
. O
The O
beautiful O
, O
rugged O
landscape O
, O
a O
point O
of O
pride O
for O
the O
region O
, O
also O
presents O
challenges O
. O
Eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
is O
made O
up O
of O
hills O
and O
“hollers O
,” O
or O
narrow O
valleys O
cut O
by O
streams O
. O
But O
the O
steep O
slopes O
are O
prone O
to O
landslides O
, O
leaving O
the O
valleys O
vulnerable O
to O
flash O
flooding O
. O
Building O
in O
the O
hills O
could O
mitigate O
flood O
risks O
, O
but O
doing O
so O
is O
extremely O
costly O
, O
says O
Bill B-PER
Haneberg I-PER
. O
“People O
have O
really O
very O
little O
choice O
except O
to O
live O
in O

When O
historic O
levels O
of O
rain O
began O
to O
fall O
in O
late O
July O
, O
the O
creeks O
along O
the O
valleys O
turned O
into O
raging O
rivers O
, O
knocking O
already O
fragile O
homes O
off O
their O
foundations O
. O
The O
floodwaters O
washed O
away O
dirt O
roads O
and O
small O
bridges O
, O
and O
some O
lost O
their O
vehicles O
. O
Many O
were O
left O
stranded O
. O
As O
a O
warming O
planet O
threatens O
to O
make O
extreme O
weather O
events O
like O
this O
more O
common O
, O
there O
are O
concerns O
about O
how O
decades O
of O
coal O
mining O
and O
fossil O
fuel O
extraction O
have O
altered O
the O
region’s O
landscape O
. O
“It O
’s O
likely O
we O
would O
have O
had O
extremely O
severe O
flooding O
even O
if O
there O
had O
never O
been O
a O
coal O
mine O
in O
eastern O
Kentucky B-LOC
,” O
Haneberg B-PER
says O
. O
“The O
question O
that O
we O
don’t O
know O
the O
answer O
to O
is O
: O
How O
much O
might O
this O
amount O
of O
disturbance O
have O
increased O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
current O
floods O
?” O
One O
county O
formed O
an O

These O
circumstances O
are O
part O
of O
why O
Slone B-PER
feels O
so O
compelled O
to O
be O
there O
for O
her O
neighbors O

After O
a O
few O
days O
of O
cooking O
and O
delivering O
meals O
with O
the O
help O
of O
her O
mother O

, O
she O
realized O
there O
were O
people O
in O
the O
community O
who O
weren’t O
being O
reached O
. O
So O
she O
enlisted O
some O
friends O
with O
off-road O

to O
go O
into O
the O
hollers O
where O
their O

can’t O

They O
travel O
deep O
into O
these O
remote O
communities O
to O
deliver O
meals O
and O
cleaning O

, O
asking O
the O
residents O
they O
encounter O
how O
many O
more O
houses O
are O
past O
them O
. O
If O
they O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
vehicle O
to O
climb O
their O
way O
there O
, O
they O
do O
. O
“A O

Slone B-PER

“And O
there O

for O

these O

Others O

are O
skeptical O

He O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
see O

he O
’s O
unsure O
whether O
the O

that O

ultimately O

be O
enough O
for O
his O

“We O

Barely O
a O
week O
after O
the O

Quillen B-PER

others O
say O
it O
feels O

how O
her O

People O

the O

that O

seven O

A O

she O

a O

The O

Politically O

a O

gives O
Republicans O
a O
chance O

sow O
discord O

But O
, O
once O
it O

over O
, O
Democrats O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
advance O
their O
package O
on O
a O
straight O
party-line O

that O

threshold O
. O
Here O
’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
: O
What O
is O
a O
vote-a-rama? O
Usually O
in O
the O
legislative O
process O
, O
lawmakers O
can O
use O
a O
series O
of O
procedural O
maneuvers O
to O
avoid O
voting O
on O
amendments O
. O
But O
in O
a O
budget O
reconciliation O
process O
– O
which O
Democrats O
are O
using O
to O
advance O
their O
bill O
– O
you O
can O
’t O
do O
that O
. O
Lawmakers O
cannot O
hold O
a O
final O
vote O
on O
a O
reconciliation O
bill O
until O
all O
the O
amendments O
have O
been O
“disposed O
of O
,” O
or O
in O
simpler O
terms O
, O
“voted O
on O
.” O
The O
practice O
involves O
votes O
on O
a O
series O
of O
amendments O
that O
can O
– O
and O
usually O
do O
– O
stretch O
for O
hours O
. O
How O
do O
lawmakers O
use O
the O
process? O
The O
party O
in O
charge O
typically O
wants O
to O
move O
this O
vote-a-rama O
along O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
with O
as O
few O
votes O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
minority O
party O
takes O
the O
opportunity O
to O
force O
votes O
on O
all O
kinds O
of O
measures O
they O
don’t O
typically O
have O
the O
power O
to O
put O
on O
the O
floor O
. O
How O
long O
does O
each O
vote O
take? O
Usually O
, O
lawmakers O
agree O
to O
a O
process O
that O
looks O
a O
lot O
like O
this O
. O
Each O
amendment O
takes O
about O
15 O
minutes O
or O
so O
to O
get O
through O
. O
The O
process O
moves O
quickly O
by O
Senate O
standards O
, O
which O
is O
why O
it O
is O
so O
important O
for O
members O
to O

stay O

close O
by O
the O
chamber O
for O
the O
entire O
marathon O

What O
’s O
in O

The O
bill O

. O
She O
remembers O
peeking O
outside O
and O
seeing O
the O
shooter O
pace O
up O
and O
down O
the O
hallway O
. O
He O
fired O
again O
and O
again O
, O
unleashing O
a O
white O
cloud O
. O
“There O
was O
all O
this O
popping O
and O
smoke O
,” O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
. O
“I O
can O
still O
smell O
the O
gunpowder O
to O
this O
day O
.” O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
removed O
her O
classroom’s O
door O
stop O
, O
closed O
and O
locked O
the O
door O
, O
and O
turned O
off O
the O
lights O
. O
She O
ordered O
the O
students O
onto O
the O
ground O
as O
gunshots O
and O
screams O
from O
other O
classrooms O
permeated O
the O
walls O
. O
She O
crawled O
across O
the O
floor O
, O
pulled O
a O
phone O
down O
from O
her O
desk O
and O
punched O
911 O
over O
and O
over O
and O
over O
. O
No O
one O
answered O
, O
she O
said O
. O
And O
then O
she O
and O
the O
other O
students O
waited O
. O
“My O
mind O
was O
going O
a O
million O
miles O
an O
hour O
,” O
she O
said O
. O
Some O
survivors O
fled O
the O
school O
and O
took O
refuge O
in O
a O
nearby O
house O
. O
Houston B-PER
then O
herded O
students O
into O
an O
upstairs O
classroom O
in O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
building O
. O
As O
he O
held O
them O
captive O
, O
he O
ranted O
about O
flunking O
out O
of O
school O
and O
blamed O
it O
on O
Brens O
, O
court O
documents O
said O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
Welch B-PER
, O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
and O
a O
group O
of O
students O
stayed O
in O
their O
hiding O
spots O
downstairs O
. O
After O
C O
building O
quieted O
down O
, O
someone O
opened O
an O
exit O
door O
and O
they O
all O
fled O
. O
“We O
all O
ran O
like O
hell O
into O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
banging O
on O
people’s O
doors O
to O
let O
us O
in O
,” O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
she O
led O
Welch B-PER
and O
a O
group O
of O
other O
students O
to O
a O
nearby O
house O
. O
In O
her O
eagerness O
to O
let O
the O
students O
inside O
, O
the O
teacher O
grabbed O
the O
screen O
door O
with O
such O
force O
that O
she O
yanked O
it O
off O
its O
hinges O
. O
The O
terrified O
homeowner O
was O
reluctant O
at O
first O
but O
allowed O
them O
to O
stay O
until O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
could O
use O
the O
home’s O
phone O
to O
call O
all O
the O
kids’ O
parents O
. O
After O
holing O
up O
in O
the O
house O
for O
hours O
, O
Welch B-PER
was O
reunited O
with O
her O
father O
. O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
remained O
at O
the O
neighbor’s O
house O
until O
the O
last O
child O
had O
gone O
home O
safely O
. O
Not O
until O
she O
emerged O
three O
hours O
later O
and O
walked O
back O
to O
the O
school O
did O
she O
begin O
to O
comprehend O
the O
magnitude O
of O
what O
was O
happening O
. O
“At O
the O
time O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
were O
the O
only O
survivors O
,” O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
. O
“Houston B-PER
was O
still O
holding O
about O
80 O
students O
hostage O
in O
a O
classroom O
, O
and O
no O
one O
knew O
what O
was O
going O
on O
.” O
SWAT O
teams O
surrounded O
the O
building O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
right O
moment O
to O
strike O
. O
Police O
and O
TV O
news O
helicopters O
hovered O
overhead O
. O
As O
afternoon O
turned O
into O
dusk O
and O
the O
sky O
faded O
to O
black O
, O
a O
shell-shocked O
community O
awaited O
word O
on O
their O
loved O
ones O
. O
The O
hours O
dragged O
on O
. O
Houston B-PER
released O
a O
few O
students O
in O
exchange O
for O
soda O
and O
boxes O
of O
pizza O
. O
He O
finally O
surrendered O
about O
10:30 O
p.m. O
, O
ending O
a O
tense O
standoff O
. O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
she O
was O
still O
outside O
the O
school O
when O
authorities O
led O
him O
out O
in O
handcuffs O
. O
That O
’s O
when O
she O
recognized O
the O
shooter O
as O
a O
student O
who O
had O
come O
to O
the O
career O
center O
a O
few O
years O
earlier O
. O
She O
remembered O
a O
blond O
, O
withdrawn O
teen O
who O
barely O
spoke O
to O
anyone O
and O
didn’t O
seem O
to O
have O
many O
friends O
. O
Three O
decades O
later O
, O
the O
shooting’s O
effects O
still O
linger O
For O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
and O
Welch B-PER
, O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
tragedy O
lingers O
30 O
years O
later O
. O
Welch B-PER
now O
46 O
, O
works O
at O
a O
hospital’s O
financial O
office O
in O
Lexington B-LOC

Kentucky B-LOC

Vanartsdalen B-PER
, O
71 O
, O
is O
retired O
and O
lives O
in O
Marysville B-LOC
, O
California B-LOC
, O
about O
five O
miles O
from O
Olivehurst B-LOC
. O
Both O
women O
said O
surviving O
a O
school O
shooting O
heightens O
your O
alertness O
in O
a O
way O
nothing O
else O
does O
. O
Even O
now O
, O
every O
time O
they O
visit O
a O
store O
, O
restaurant O
, O
or O
other O
public O
place O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
they O
do O
is O
map O
out O
an O
exit O
strategy O
. O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
is O
wary O
of O
hovering O
helicopters O
, O
firecrackers O
and O
popping O
balloons O
. O
On O
a O
recent O
dinner O
date O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
she O
almost O
panicked O
when O
she O
noticed O
a O
man O
pacing O
anxiously O
in O
the O
restaurant O
. O
The O
moment O
passed O
without O
incident O
, O
but O
she O
remains O
vigilant O
about O
her O
safety O
. O
Both O
women O
said O
they O
got O
weeks O
of O
counseling O
and O
therapy O
afterward O
. O
But O
back O
then O
, O
therapists O
were O
not O
as O
equipped O
to O
handle O
mass O
shootings O
. O
“My O
therapist O
seemed O
so O
overwhelmed O
with O
everything O
, O
I O
stopped O
going O
after O
a O
while O
,” O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O
“What O
seemed O
to O
help O
more O
was O
talking O
about O
it O
with O
other O
people O
in O
the O
community O
, O
both O
friends O
and O
strangers O
.” O
Several O
months O
after O
the O
shooting O
, O
Welch B-PER
was O
surprised O
to O
receive O
a O
package O
with O
an O
autographed O
photo O
and O
a O
note O
from O
Mariah B-PER
Carey I-PER
, O
one O
of O
her O
favorite O
singers O
. O
“I O
’m O
so O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
friend O
and O
the O
horrible O
situation O
you O
went O
through O
,” O
it O
said O
. O
“It O
’s O
great O
that O
you O
have O
such O
a O
positive O
attitude O
about O
things O
now O
.” O
And O
in O
1994 O
, O
Welch B-PER
was O
a O
guest O
on O
Oprah B-PER
Winfrey I-PER
’s O
TV O
show O
, O
where O
she O
appeared O
with O
other O
survivors O
of O
mass O
shootings O
and O
shared O
her O
recollections O
of O
that O
fateful O
day O
. O
“Oprah B-PER
asked O
me O
questions O
about O
my O
experience O
and O
how O
I O
was O
handling O
things O
now O
. O
We O
did O
talk O
a O
little O
about O
Beamon B-PER
,” O
she O
said O
. O
“What O
I O
remember O
most O
is O
her O
kindness O
… O
her O
words O
of O
encouragement O
to O
stay O
strong O
and O
do O
positive O
things O
in O
life O
.” O
These O
days O
, O
as O
school O
shootings O
become O
more O
common O
, O
Welch B-PER
said O
she O
’s O
forced O
to O
replay O
that O
day O
over O
and O
over O
. O
Every O
new O
shooting O
is O
a O
trigger O
– O
and O
a O
reminder O
of O
what O
lies O
ahead O
for O
the O
survivors O
. O
“Those O
poor O
kids O
from O
all O
these O
school O
shootings O
will O
have O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
live O
their O
lives O
going O
forward O
,” O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O
The O
women O
still O
remember O
those O
who O
died O
that O
day O
. O
Welch B-PER
said O
she O
will O
never O
forget O
her O
classmate O
Beamon B-PER
’s O
heroic O
act O
. O
She O
’s O
told O
her O
two O
children O
about O
the O
popular O
16-year-old O
prankster O
who O
helped O
keep O
everyone O
loose O
and O
may O
have O
saved O
their O
mother’s O
life O
. O
Welch B-PER
said O
she O
remembers O
that O
earlier O
that O
day O
, O
Beamon B-PER
had O
tossed O
a O
crumpled-up O
piece O
of O
paper O
across O
the O
classroom O
. O
When O
the O
teacher O
asked O
who O
did O
it O
, O
he O
had O
put O
on O
his O
game O
face O
and O
pointed O
at O
Welch B-PER
. O
The O
other O
classmates O
erupted O
into O
laughter O
because O
they O
knew O
he O
was O
the O
culprit O
, O
she O
said O
. O
“Beamon B-PER
got O
me O
in O
so O
much O
trouble O
,” O
Welch B-PER
said O
. O
“He O
knew O
exactly O
how O
to O
make O
me O
smile O
when O
I O
was O
stressed O
before O
a O
test O
.” O
Houston B-PER
was O
eventually O
convicted O
of O
four O
counts O
of O
first-degree O
murder O
and O
remains O
on O
death O
row O
at O
San B-LOC
Quentin I-LOC
State I-LOC
Prison I-LOC
. O
The O
Olivehurst B-LOC
community O
has O
largely O
moved O
on O
from O
the O
shooting O
, O
Vanartsdalen B-PER
said O
, O
and O
people O
there O
rarely O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
except O
on O
the O
anniversary O
. O
But O
revisiting O
what O
happened O
on O
May O
1 O
, O
1992 O
, O
remains O
a O
form O
of O
therapy O
for O
her O
– O
and O
a O
way O
to O
honor O
those O
who O
were O
lost O
. O
“Four O
people O
died O
that O
day O
,” O
she O
said O

“We O
should O
never O
forget O
them O
.” O

Wisconsin B-LOC
Republican O
Sen. O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER

are O
political O
opposites O

But O
as O
the O
two O
prepare O
for O
what O
could O
become O
one O
of O
the O
most O
closely O
watched O
Senate O
races O
of O
the O
2022 O
cycle O
, O
they O
are O
leveling O
similar O
attacks O
to O
define O
each O
other O
: O
Casting O
their O
opponent O
as O
too O
extreme O
and O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
, O
while O
arguing O
the O
other O
is O
not O
a O

“The O
problem O
is O
Ron B-PER

turned O
his O
back O

my O
entire O
career O

even O
before O

Barnes B-PER
said O
when O
asked O
for O
the O
single O
biggest O
difference O
between O
himself O
and O
Johnson B-PER
, O
who O
made O
millions O
running O
a O
plastics O
manufacturer O
before O
he O
entered O
public O
office O
. O
“His O
wealth O
is O

the O

– O
it’s O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
ultra-wealthy O

out O
of O

Johnson B-PER

campaign O
declined O
to O
make O
him O
available O
to O
CNN B-ORG

but O
a O
Johnson B-PER
campaign O
adviser O
previewed O
a O
notably O
similar O
message O
. O
“(Barnes) O
is O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
where O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
state O
is O
,” O
said O
adviser O
Ben B-PER
Voelkel I-PER
, O
citing O
some O
of O
the O
more O
liberal O
positions O
Barnes B-PER
has O
backed O
throughout O
his O
career O
. O
“Mandela B-PER

a O
lot O
about O

any O
of O
that O
. O
He O
has O
been O
a O
career O
political O
activist O
.” O
Johnson B-PER
has O
already O
described O
Barnes B-PER
as O
Democrats’ O
“most O
radical O
left O
candidate O
,” O
adding O
that O
“a O
radical O
left O
Senator O
from O
Wisconsin B-LOC
is O
not O
the O
solution O
.” O
Johnson B-PER
recently O
called O
him O
“a O
progressive O
puppet O
out O
to O
fundamentally O
change O
America B-MISC

The O
attacks O
– O
delivered O
ahead O
of O
Tuesday’s O
Wisconsin B-LOC
Senate O
primaries O
, O
which O
appear O
to O
be O
already O
decided O
– O
are O
previews O
of O
what O
will O
likely O
become O
an O
acrimonious O
race O
, O
one O
that O
experts O
expect O
will O
see O
tens O
of O
millions O
spent O
on O
negative O
advertising O
as O
each O
side O
attempts O
to O
solidify O
their O
base O
voters O
in O

. O
Johnson B-PER
, O
the O
incumbent O
, O
faces O
no O
primary O
challenge O
after O
he O
opted O
to O
run O
for O
a O
third O
term O
. O
The O
senator O

who O
promised O
to O
only O
serve O
another O
full O
term O
when O
he O
ran O
for O
reelection O
in O
2016 O
, O
waffled O
on O
the O
third O
term O
for O
months O
, O
but O
eventually O
decided O
to O
get O
into O
the O
race O
because O
“America B-MISC
is O
in O
peril O
” O
and O
he O
wants O
to O
end O
Democratic O
control O
of O
Washington B-LOC
. O
Barnes B-PER
initially O
had O
significant O
primary O
challengers O
, O
including O
Milwaukee B-LOC
Bucks O
executive O
Alex B-PER
Lasry I-PER
, O
who O
spent O
more O
than O
$11 O
million O
of O
his O
own O
money O
airing O
ads O
throughout O
the O
state O
. O
But O
over O
the O
span O
of O
a O
week O
last O
month O
, O
Barnes’ O
three O
top O
primary O
opponents O
– O
Lasry B-PER
, O
Wisconsin B-LOC
state O
Treasurer O
Sarah B-PER
Godlewski I-PER
and O
Outagamie B-LOC
County O
Executive O
Tom B-PER
Nelson I-PER
– O
all O
dropped O
out O
of O
the O
race O
and O
endorsed O
the O
lieutenant O
governor O
, O
effectively O
ending O
the O
primary O
. O
“I O
could O
not O
have O
imagined O
it O
ending O
up O
this O
way O
,” O
Barnes B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“To O
me O
, O
it O
shows O
just O
how O
important O
beating O
Ron B-PER

just O
how O
important O
expanding O
the O

.” O
As O
the O
two O
candidates O
turn O
their O
focus O
on O
each O
other O
, O
Wisconsin B-LOC
represents O
yet O
another O
example O
of O
a O
high O
stakes O
Senate O
race O
where O
the O
contrast O
between O
candidates O
is O
significant O

Sen. O
Raphael B-PER

Kelly I-PER
in O
Arizona B-LOC
. O
‘The O
most O
vulnerable O
Republican O
incumbent O
’ O
The O
Barnes B-PER
strategy O
is O
to O
define O
Johnson B-PER
as O
a O
changed O
man O
, O
someone O
who O
went O
to O
Washington B-LOC
as O
an O
insurgent O
candidate O
but O
then O
enmeshed O
himself O
into O
the O
Republican O
Party O
led O
by O
former O
President O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
. O
The O
attacks O
will O
include O
Johnson B-PER
’s O
own O
admission O
that O
the O
2017 O
tax O
bill O
passed O
by O
Republicans O
in O
Washington B-LOC
benefited O
his O
own O
company O

his O
reported O
role O
in O
attempting O
to O
push O
a O
slate O
of O
fake O
electors O
after O
the O
2020 O
election O

and O
his O
more O
recent O
suggestion O
that O
Social O

two O
popular O
social O

programs O

changed O

something O
experts O
argue O
could O
effectively O
end O
the O
programs O

“What O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
we O

to O
turn O
everything O

Johnson B-PER

earlier O

Barnes B-PER
wasted O

time O
jumping O
on O
the O
comment O

using O
it O
to O

that O

makes O
it O
impossible O
for O
him O

“If O

that’s O
on O
him O
,” O
Barnes B-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
, O
using O
the O
Johnson B-PER
comment O
to O
inoculate O
himself O
from O
Republican O
charges O
of O
being O
too O
extreme O
. O
“That’s O
much O
more O
extreme O
than O

.” O
With O
the O
primary O
all O
but O
decided O
, O
Barnes B-PER
put O
out O
an O
attack O
ad O
earlier O
this O
month O
that O
hit O
Johnson B-PER
on O
outsourcing O
jobs O
, O
using O
the O
senator’s O
defense O
of O
a O
company O
that O
took O
jobs O
out O
of O
Wisconsin B-LOC
. O
“Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER
couldn’t O
be O
more O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
Wisconsin B-LOC
,” O
the O
ad O
says O
. O
Democrats O
are O
also O
preparing O
to O
paint O
Johnson B-PER
as O
a O
candidate O
who O
has O
become O
a O
conspiracy O
theory O
promoter O
, O
including O
questioning O
the O
push O
to O
vaccinate O
people O
against O
the O
coronavirus O
, O
calling O
climate O
change O
“bullsh*t O
,” O
and O
suggesting O
– O
without O
any O
evidence O
– O
that O
the O
FBI O
had O
more O
inside O
knowledge O
than O
it O
let O
on O
about O
the O
US B-LOC
Capitol O
insurrection O
on O
January O

, O
2021 O
. O
Republican O
operatives O
working O
on O
Senate O
campaigns O
acknowledged O
the O
impact O
some O
of O
Johnson’s O
comments O
have O
had O
on O
his O
image O
. O
A O
recent O
Marquette B-ORG
Law O
School O
poll O
found O
that O
46% O
of O

voters O
viewed O
him O
unfavorably O
, O
compared O
to O
37% O
who O
had O
a O
favorable O
view O
. O
But O
one O
operative O
argued O
that O
some O
positive O
Johnson B-PER
messaging O
over O
the O
summer O
, O
including O
significant O
spending O
by O
an O
outside O
group O
focused O
on O
inflation O
and O
a O

campaign O
ad O
focus O
on O
legislation O
that O
allowed O

done O
some O

. O
“His O
numbers O
are O

the O
operative O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
, O
no O

what O
, O
“it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
close O
race O
.” O
Democrats O
see O
negative O
views O
of O
Johnson B-PER
as O
central O
to O
their O
plan O
of O
turning O
the O
general O
election O
into O
a O
referendum O
of O
the O
senator O
. O
“Ron B-PER

. O
‘Defined O

The O
attacks O
on O
Barnes B-PER
center O
on O
accusations O
that O
he O
is O
too O
extreme O
for O
the O
state O
, O
using O
his O
time O
as O
a O
community O
organizer O
, O
a O
state O
assemblyman O
from O
a O
solidly O
Democratic O
district O

a O

” O
in O
the O
Working B-ORG

against O
him O
as O
he O
runs O
for O

The O
hits O
include O
his O
ties O
to O
members O
of O
the O
“Squad O

a O
group O
of O
liberal O

of O

views O
the O
Johnson B-PER

believes O
are O
too O
“extreme O
” O
for O
Wisconsin B-LOC

. O
Barnes B-PER
has O
said O
he O
does O
not O
support O
abolishing O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
Immigration O
and O
Customs O
Enforcement O
but O
supports O
“addressing O

can O

that O

not O
where O
50+1 O
of O
the O
state O
sits O
,” O
Voelkel B-PER
said O
. O
One O
issue O
that O
Barnes’ O
campaign O
must O
confront O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
polls O
show O
that O
many O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
don’t O
know O
enough O
about O
him O
to O
have O
an O
opinion O
– O
something O
that O
can O
be O
both O
helpful O
and O
hurtful O
. O
“Barnes B-PER
is O
not O
nearly O
as O
known O
in O
the O
state O
as O

,” O
said O
Charles B-PER
Franklin I-PER
, O
pollster O
for O
the O
Marquette B-ORG
Law O

poll O
, O
citing O
a O
recent O
poll O
that O
found O
over O
50% O
of O

didn’t O
know O
enough O
about O
the O

form O
an O
opinion O
. O
“That O
is O
an O

side O

to O
really O
try O
to O
step O
in O
and O
define O
Barnes B-PER

And O
they O
plan O
to O
do O
just O
that O
, O
with O
the O
Johnson B-PER
campaign O
and O
outside O
groups O
already O
gearing O
up O
to O
cast O
Barnes B-PER
as O
out O
of O
step O
with O
most O
Wisconsin B-LOC

. O
“He O

by O
all O
these O

took O
in O

said O
Jack B-PER
Pandol I-PER
, O
spokesman O
for O
Senate O
Leadership O
Fund O
, O
a O
Republican O
super O
PAC O
focused O
on O

“There O
is O
a O
lot O
that O

going O
to O
be O
made O
aware O
of O
in O
the O
coming O
months O
and O
that O
will O
be O
the O
first O
information O
that O
some O
voters O
are O
getting O
about O
Barnes B-PER
.” O
Barnes B-PER
responded O
to O
these O
attacks O
by O
saying O
Republicans O
“tried O
to O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
about O
Tammy B-PER
Baldwin I-PER
,” O
and O
she O
went O
on O
to O
win O
the O
state’s O
other O
Senate O
seat O
in O
2012 O
and O
reelection O
in O
2018 O
. O
“People O
like O
Ron B-PER
Johnson I-PER
are O
going O
to O
lie O
about O
whatever O
, O
anything O
he O
can O
think O
of O
, O
to O
take O
the O
heat O
off O
his O
own O
bad O
behavior O
,” O
he O
said O
. O
‘We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool O
’ O
The O
question O
among O
experts O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
is O
whether O
, O
after O
years O
of O
polarization O
and O
remarkably O
tight O
elections O
, O
there O
are O
even O
enough O
persuadable O
voters O
in O
the O
state O
to O
make O
the O
general O
election O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
base-focused O
race O
. O
Wisconsin B-LOC
has O
been O
a O
swing O
state O
for O
years O
. O
When O
Trump B-PER
won O
it O
in O
2016 O
, O
he O
was O
the O
first O
Republican O
to O
win O
it O
since O
1984 O
. O
While O
Biden B-PER
won O
the O
state O
back O
in O
2020 O
, O
the O
state O
has O
long O
had O
years O
of O
Republican O
governors O
, O
including O
Scott B-PER
Walker I-PER
from O
2011 O
to O
2019 O
, O
and O
Republicans O
control O
both O
chambers O
of O
the O
state O
legislature O
. O
“We O
were O
polarized O
before O
it O
was O
cool O
,” O
said O
Joe B-PER
Zepecki I-PER
, O
a O
Democratic O
operative O
in O
Wisconsin B-LOC
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
fights O
around O
union O
rights O
in O
2011 O
and O
2012 O
led O
to O
the O
state O
being O
deeply O
polarized O
long O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
Donald B-PER
Trump I-PER
. O
“So O
that O
shrinking O
segment O
of O
swing O
voters O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
ball O
game O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
political O
environment O
may O
be O
bad O
, O
but O
Republicans’ O
brand O
is O
rotten O
with O
those O
voters O
.” O
This O
is O
why O
political O
watchers O
like O
Franklin B-PER
and O
others O
expect O
a O
deluge O
of O
negative O
ads O
in O
the O
contest O
, O
with O
both O
sides O
running O
campaigns O
that O
“reflect O
that O
polarization O
that O
we O
have O
had O
for O
a O
good O
12 O
years O
.” O
Democrats O
are O
confident O
that O
if O
they O
can O
turn O
the O
race O
into O
a O
referendum O
on O
Johnson B-PER
, O
there O
are O
enough O
votes O
who O
have O
backed O
him O
in O
the O
past O
who O
are O
ready O
for O
an O
alternative O
. O
“There O
is O
absolutely O
a O
world O
of O
ticket O
splitters O
, O
a O
world O
of O
persuadable O
voters O
and O
a O
world O
of O
people O
who O
might O
or O
might O
turn O
out O

said O
Ben B-PER
Wikler I-PER
, O
chair O
of O
the O
Democratic O
Party O
of O
Wisconsin B-LOC

Democrats O
do O
, O
however O

face O
a O
difficult O
national O
environment O
, O
with O

skeptical O
of O
Democratic O

in O
Washington B-LOC

With O
this O
in O
mind O

Barnes B-PER
argued O
it O
would O
be O
Wisconsin B-LOC
Gov. O
Tony B-PER
Evers I-PER
– O
not O
the O
president O
– O
who O
would O
have O
the O
most O
direct O

on O
the O
contest O
. O
Evers B-PER
himself O
is O
up O
for O
reelection O
. O
While O
he O
did O
not O
have O
a O
primary O
challenge O
, O
he O
will O
likely O
face O
a O
tough O
race O
against O
whoever O
emerges O
from O
what O
has O
been O
a O
tight O
Republican O
primary O
race O
on O
Tuesday O
. O
“This O
is O
a O
very O
Wisconsin B-LOC
focused O
race O
,” O
he O
said O
, O
citing O
a O
recent O
poll O
that O
found O
48% O
of O
Wisconsin B-LOC
voters O
approved O
of O
Evers B-PER

“I O
would O
say O
that O
people O
know O
the O

Following O

Splits O
can O
also O
boost O

First O

the O

About O
600,000 O

the O

the O
1.5 O

1.6 O

Those O
who O
should O
definitely O
get O
the O
vaccine O
are O
those O
with O
known O
exposure O
to O
someone O
with O
monkeypox O
. O
If O
given O
within O
four O
days O
of O
exposure O
, O
the O
vaccine O
can O
prevent O
someone O
from O
developing O
monkeypox O
. O
If O
given O
within O
two O
weeks O
, O
it O
lessens O
the O
likelihood O
of O
progression O

severe O
illness O

Soon O
, O
I O

there O
will O
be O
enough O
vaccine O
so O
that O
people O
in O

are O
able O

access O
it O

But O
given O
the O
way O
that O

most O

are O
not O
likely O

contract O
it O

a O

would O
Pelosi B-PER
go O
? O
So O
why O
did O
Pelosi B-PER
go O
and O
would O
her O
trip O
needlessly O
antagonize O
China B-LOC
’s O
leadership O
? O
Supporters O
of O
the O
visit O
, O
who O
unusually O
include O
many O
Republicans O
lined O
up O
behind O
Pelosi B-PER
, O
say O
it O
’s O
critical O
for O
the O
speaker O
to O
show O
support O
for O
Taiwan B-LOC
and O
to O
underscore O
Washington B-LOC
is O
serious O
about O
its O
legal O
commitment O
to O
offer O
the O
island O
the O
means O
of O
its O
self-defense O
. O
Pelosi B-PER
is O
also O
a O
symbol O
of O
democracy O
– O
a O
way O
of O
life O
that O
Taipei B-LOC
is O
desperate O
to O
preserve O
under O
China B-LOC
’s O
authoritarian O
shadow O
. O
But O
the O
controversy O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O
This O
is O
about O
a O
broader O
context O
of O
China B-LOC
’s O
building O
challenge O
to O
America B-LOC
’s O
determination O
to O
preserve O
democracy O
, O
Western O
values O
and O
military O
and O
economic O
primacy O
in O
the O
Pacific O
and O
across O
the O
world O
. O
Once O
news O
of O
Pelosi B-PER
’s O
expected O
visit O
leaked O
, O
it O
became O
politically O
implausible O
– O
domestically O
and O
for O
strategic O
reasons O
– O
for O
her O
to O
bend O
to O
Beijing B-LOC
’s O
warnings O
that O
she O
should O
not O
go O
. O
It O
would O
be O
unpalatable O
for O
Pelosi B-PER
, O
following O
a O
political O
career O
partly O
defined O
by O
standing O
up O
to O
China B-LOC
, O
to O
give O
up O
on O
her O
plan O
. O
And O
it O
would O
send O
a O
message O
that O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
first O
standoffs O
with O
a O
newly O
confident O
superpower O
rival O
in O
the O
Pacific O
, O
would O
back O
down O
. O
Biden B-PER
also O
had O
political O
considerations O
. O
While O
he O
publicly O
admitted O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
military O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
visit O
, O
he O
could O
not O
openly O
side O
with O
China B-LOC
over O
Pelosi B-PER
. O
And O
a O
President O
can O
hardly O
order O
one O
of O
the O
top O
representatives O
of O
another O
branch O
of O
government O
what O
she O
should O
and O
should O
not O
do O
, O
even O
if O
officials O
worked O
to O
apprise O
the O
speaker O
of O
all O
the O
potential O
consequences O
of O
her O
decision O
. O
Politics O
are O
driving O
China B-LOC
’s O
actions O
too O
. O
Politics O
rage O
within O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
politburo O
, O
too O
, O
though O
many O
in O
the O
West O
often O
view O
China B-LOC
’s O
communist I-LOC
leadership O
as O
monolithic O
. O
Xi B-PER
built O
his O
power O
base O
on O
aggressive O
nationalism O
and O
the O
idea O
that O
Taiwan B-LOC
’s O
destiny O
is O
“ O
reunification O
” O
with O
the O
mainland O
. O
He O
is O
determined O
to O
preside O
over O
a O
national O
rejuvenation O
that O
will O
purge O
China B-LOC
’s O
past O
humiliation O
over O
colonialism O
and O
long O
20th O
century O
isolation O
when O
it O
did O
not O
wield O
what O
he O
views O
as O
its O
rightful O
influence O
in O
the O
world O
. O
So O
Pelosi B-PER
’s O
expected O
visit O
is O
more O
than O
a O
jab O
at O
China B-LOC
; O
it O
’s O
a O
personal O
slight O
to O
Xi B-PER
’s O
core O
project O
by O
one O
of O
the O
most O
senior O
US B-LOC
politicians O
– O
and O
is O
one O
that O
demands O
a O
political O
response O
. O
The O
crisis O
also O
comes O
at O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
. O
In O
a O
few O
months O
, O
Xi B-PER
is O
poised O
to O
claim O
an O
unusual O
third O
term O
and O
he O
cannot O
afford O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
weak O
. O
And O
his O
government O
’s O
questionable O
handling O
of O
the O
Covid-19 B-MISC
pandemic O
– O
mass O
lockdowns O
are O
still O
common O
in O
Chinese B-LOC
cities O
– O
and O
a O
slowing O
economy O
, O
mean O
Xi B-PER
could O
be O
tempted O
into O
a O
nationalistic O
stand O
to O
mask O
domestic O
liabilities O
. O
A O
long O
festering O
dispute O
While O
the O
current O
standoff O
is O
alarming O
, O
Taiwan B-LOC
has O
long O
been O
an O
irritant O
in O
US B-LOC
-China B-LOC
relations O
. O
The O
dispute O
is O
made O
even O
more O
confusing O
by O
complicated O
diplomatic O
agreements O
and O
nuanced O
US B-LOC
strategic O
doctrines O
designed O
to O
avoid O
the O
possibility O
of O
war O
with O
China B-LOC
. O
The O
island O
is O
viewed O
by O
Beijing B-LOC
as O
a O
rightful O
part O
of O
its O
territory O
. O
The O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
recognizes O
the O
People’s O
Republic O
of O
China B-LOC
on O
the O
mainland O
as O
the O
sole O
legitimate O
government O
of O
China B-LOC
and O
doesn’t O
regard O
Taiwan B-LOC
as O
a O
country O
. O
But O
it O
doesn’t O
accept O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
Communist I-ORG
Party O
’s O
claim O
of O
sovereignty O
over O
the O
democratic O
island O
. O
While O
it O
offers O
Taiwan B-LOC
the O
means O
of O
self O
defense O
when O
it O
buys O
US B-LOC
made O
weapons O
, O
Washington B-LOC
has O
adopted O
a O
policy O
of O
purposeful O
vagueness O
over O
whether O
it O
would O
itself O
defend O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
partly O
to O
deter O
a O
declaration O
of O
independence O
from O
Taipei B-LOC
and O
to O
give O
leaders O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
second O
thoughts O
about O
a O
forceful O
takeover O
of O
the O
island O
. O
Robert B-PER
Daly I-PER
, O
a O
former O
US B-LOC
diplomat O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
said O
Monday O
that O
China B-LOC
’s O
eventual O
response O
– O
perhaps O
, O
for O
example O
, O
an O
incursion O
into O
Taiwanese O
airspace O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
cause O
a O
war O
but O
would O
push O
the O
rivals O
closer O
to O
a O
danger O
zone O
. O
“ O
That O
will O
set O
up O
a O
new O
baseline O
that O
leads O
us O
slightly O
closer O
to O
confrontation O
, O

on O
China B-LOC

the O
United B-LOC

told O

Pamela B-PER

“ O
I O
don’t O
think O
that O
we O

” O
Why O
Biden B-PER
worries O
about O
the O
trip O
Biden B-PER
has O
reorganized O
US B-LOC
foreign O
policy O
around O
the O
principle O
of O
countering O
China B-LOC
’s O
growing O
might O
in O
Asia O
and O
further O
afield O
. O
Thirty O
years O
ago O
, O
Washington B-LOC
hoped O
that O
by O
encouraging O
then-reclusive O
China B-LOC
into O
the O
global O
economy O
it O
could O
promote O
political O
liberalization O
and O
usher O
it O
into O
the O
Western-oriented O
global O
economic O
and O
political O
system O
. O
But O
Beijing B-LOC
has O
sought O
to O
use O
its O
rising O
military O
and O
political O
power O
and O
influence O
to O
build O
an O
alternative O
political O
and O
economic O
value O
system O
to O
the O
one O
represented O
by O
the O
US B-LOC
and O
its O
allies O
. O
But O
Biden B-PER
also O
wants O
to O
manage O
this O
new O
competitive O
relationship O
so O
that O
it O
does O
not O
result O
in O
war O
between O
the O
rising O
power O
in O
the O
Pacific O
( O
China B-LOC
) O
and O
the O
existing O
one O
( O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
) O
and O
its O
allies O
. O
The O
US B-LOC
leader O
stressed O
in O
a O
telephone O
call O
with O
Xi B-PER
last O
week O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
change O
to O
the O
fundamental O
nature O
of O
US B-LOC
-China B-LOC
relations O
or O
the O
position O
of O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Taiwan B-LOC
. O
Yet O
seen O
from O
Beijing B-LOC
, O
Biden B-PER
’s O
repeated O
recent O
statements O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
would O
defend O
Taiwan B-LOC
, O
which O
were O
all O
walked O
back O
by O
aides O
, O
may O
have O
left O
an O
impression O
that O
he O
is O
not O
sincere O
. O
China B-LOC
is O
also O
watching O
a O
growing O
movement O
among O
hawks O
in O
Congress O
for O
Washington B-LOC
to O
replace O
the O
policy O
of O
“ O
strategic O
ambiguity O
” O
over O
US B-LOC
intentions O
if O
China B-LOC
invades O
Taiwan B-LOC
for O
a O
clear O
statement O
that O
the O
US B-LOC
would O
defend O
the O
island O
. O
Some O
analysts O
say O
such O
a O
shift O
could O
not O
only O
risk O
dragging O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
into O
a O
war O
in O
the O
Pacific O
against O
China B-LOC
that O
Americans O
are O
not O
prepared O
for O
, O
but O
that O
it O
could O
also O
make O
Beijing B-LOC
even O
more O
aggressive O
. O
Or O
that O
the O
promise O
of O
a O
US B-LOC
shield O
could O
embolden O
a O
push O
for O
independence O
in O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
could O
also O
force O
China B-LOC

hand O
and O
bring O
a O
broader O
military O
conflict O
over O
the O

Ahead O
of O
Pelosi B-PER

official O
statements O
by O

firmly O
restated O
that O
there O
had O
been O
no O
change O
to O
US B-LOC
policy O

affirmed O
her O
right O

hinted O
at O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
rocky O
few O
weeks O
when O

“ O

is O
not O
uncommon O
for O

to O
travel O

“ O
We O

Zhang B-PER
Jun I-PER
, O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
ambassador O

warned O
again O
that O
China B-LOC

military O
would O
not O
“ O
sit O
by O
idly O
” O
as O
Pelosi B-PER
visits O
and O
that O
her O
trip O
would O
have O
an O
“ O
egregious O
political O
impact O

” O
The O
assumption O
in O
Washington B-LOC
is O
that O
Xi B-PER
has O
no O
more O
interest O
in O
a O
direct O
military O
showdown O
than O
Biden B-PER
does O
. O
But O
he O
’s O
stronger O
than O
previous O
Chinese B-ORG
leaders O

And O
there O
is O
a O
strongly O
nationalist O
streak O
within O
the O
Chinese B-ORG
military O
along O
with O
growing O
confidence O
about O
its O
capacity O

So O
making O
assumptions O
about O
how O
China B-LOC
would O
respond O
to O
Pelosi B-PER

visit O
based O
on O
its O
behavior O

if O

over O

Something O
to O

That O
’s O
the O
lesson O

from O
