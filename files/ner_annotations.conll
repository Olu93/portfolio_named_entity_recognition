medical O

of O

said O
in O
late O
July O
that O
about O
20% O
to O
25% O
of O
patients O
there O
have O
met O
the O
criteria O

Tpoxx. O
As O
of O
July O
23, O
the O
treatment O
had O
been O
prescribed O
for O
about O
215 O

of O
839 O
confirmed O
cases. O

Anecdotally O
, O
of O
the O
providers O
that O
we’ve O
spoken O
to O
, O
we’ve O
seen O
, O
very O
commonly O
, O
significant O
improvements O
within O
just O
a O
few O
days O
of O
starting O

improvements O
in O

. O
And O
very O
significantly O
, O
we O
have O
not O
seen O
any O
significant O
adverse O

reported O
and O
very O
few O
even O
mild O
adverse O
events O
. O

Some O
headaches O

nausea O
. O

But O
that’s O
pretty O
much O
it,” O
Foote B-PER
said. O
However, O
it’s O
unclear O
what O
proportion O
of O
the O
more O
than O
5,000 O
probable O
or O
confirmed O
cases O
nationwide O
have O
been O
treated O

CDC B-ORG
officials O

that O
more O

223 O

July B-MISC
22, O
but O
the O

did O
not O
respond O
to O

for O
a O
more O
specific O
number. O

Experts O
say O
the O
number O

a O

, O
he O
says O
, O
they O
didn’t O
know O
how O

treat O
him O

sent O
him O
home O

But O
his O

only O
got O
worse O

Exhausted O

He O
got O
there O
in O
the O
middle O

the O
night O
; O
several O

met O
Chin-Hong B-PER

To O
get O
Tpoxx O
, O
a O
patient O
must O
sign O

The O
CDC B-ORG

“ O
They O

made O
it O

it O

there’s O
a O

some O

As O
a O

Tpoxx B-MISC
has O
been O
disproportionately O

“We O

trials O

not O
only O

much-needed O
data O

how O

Tpoxx O
, O
they O
would O
help O
expand O
access O
in O
two O
ways O
. O
First O
, O
clinical O
data O
could O
help O
the O
drug O
qualify O
for O
a O
different O
type O
of O
regulatory O
approval O
that O
allows O
broader O
access O
with O
fewer O
hurdles O
. O
Second O
, O
trials O
could O
help O
ease O
access O

for O
people O
who O
don’t O
qualify O
under O
the O
current O
Expanded O
Access O
protocol O
, O
such O
as O
those O
with O
milder O
disease O
. O
“Historically O
, O
antivirals O

better O
earlier O

later O

we O

clinical O
data O
to O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O

pandemic O

The O
unfortunate O
parallel O
is O
that O
the O
US B-LOC

behind O
the O

“ O

It’s O
a O
make-or-break O
week O
for O
President O
Joe B-PER
Biden’s I-PER
agenda O
. O
The O
deal O
on O
energy O
and O
health O
care O
that O
Senate O
Majority O
Leader O
Chuck B-PER
Schumer I-PER
and O
Sen. O
Joe B-PER
Manchin I-PER
announced O
last O

has O

narrow O
window O
to O
navigate O
both O
chambers O
of O
Congress O
and O
land O
on O
the O
President’s O
desk O
before O
August B-MISC
recess O
. O
And O
with O
the O
shock O
of O
the O
deal’s O
announcement O
wearing O
off O
, O
GOP B-ORG
opposition O
, O
public O
scrutiny O
, O
and O
Democrats’ O
slim O
majorities O
will O
all O
have O
a O
say O
in O
whether O
the O
legislation O
is O
a O
breakthrough O
or O
a O
bust O
. O
Here’s O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
. O

What’s O
in O
the O
bill? O
The O
agreement O
contains O
a O
number O
of O
Democrats’ B-MISC
goals, O
including O
some O
provisions O
that O
party O
leaders O
have O
worked O
toward O
for O
years: O
What’s O
not O
in O
the O
bill? O
To O
be O
clear, O
this O
isn’t O
Build B-MISC
Back I-MISC
Better I-MISC
2.0. O
The O
package O
is O
less O
than O
half O
the O
size O
of O
Biden’s B-PER
original O
social O
safety O
net O
plan, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
key O
Democratic B-MISC
priorities O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
left O
out, O
including: O
What O
are O
Republicans B-MISC
saying? O
The O
package, O
as O
it O
stands, O
is O
facing O
furious O
GOP B-MISC
opposition. O
Republican B-MISC
lawmakers O
on O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Finance I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
released O
data O
from O
the O
nonpartisan O
Joint B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
on O
Taxation I-ORG
that O
showed O
that O
Americans B-MISC
of O
all O
incomes O
would O
see O
their O
federal O
taxes O
rise O
under O
the O
climate O
and O
health O
care O
package. O
That O
analysis, O
however, O
looked O
at O
the O
indirect O
effect O
of O
the O
15% O
minimum O
tax O
provision O
on O
corporations. O
Economists O
assume O
companies O
would O
then O
pass O
along O
part O
of O
their O
tax O
increase O
to O
employees O
by O
reducing O
their O
after-tax O
wages O
and O
job O
opportunities. O
Also, O
shareholders O
would O
take O
a O
hit O
since O
the O
value O
of O
their O
stock O
holdings, O
including O
those O
held O
in O
pensions O
and O
mutual O
funds, O
would O
likely O
decline. O

What’s O
Biden B-PER
saying? O
The O
President O
has O
urged O
congressional O
Democrats O
to O
quickly O
pass O
the O
surprise O
agreement O
“for O
America.” B-LOC
“This O
bill O
is O
far O
from O
perfect. O
It’s O
a O
compromise. O

But O
it’s O
often O
how O
progress O
is O
made O
, O
by O
compromises O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
that O
my O
message O
to O
Congress O
is O
this: O
This O
is O
the O
strongest O
bill O
you O
can O
pass O
to O
lower O
inflation O
, O
cut O
the O
deficit O
, O
reduce O
health O
care O
costs O
, O
tackle O
the O
climate O
crises O
and O
promote O
energy O
security O
– O
all O
the O
time O
while O
reducing O
the O
burdens O
facing O
working-class O
and O
middle-class O
families O
, O
” O
Biden B-PER
said O
during O
a O
speech O
at O
the O
White B-LOC
House I-LOC
the O
day O
after O
the O
deal O
was O
announced O
. O
What’s O
the O
timeline? O
The O
health O
and O
climate O
bill O
stands O
a O
serious O
chance O
of O
becoming O
law O
as O
soon O
as O
August B-MISC
, O
assuming O
it O
passes O
muster O
with O
the O
Senate B-ORG
parliamentarian O
to O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
approved O
along O
straight O
party O
lines O
in O
the O
budget O
process O
– O
and O
all O
Democrats B-ORG
vote O
for O
it O
( O
more O
on O
that O
below O
) O
– O
and O
that O
the O
House B-ORG
passes O
it O
. O
Democrats B-ORG
need O
all O
50 O
of O
their O
senators O
to O
be O
present O
and O
vote O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
bill O
with O
Vice O
President O
Kamala B-PER
Harris I-PER
casting O
the O
tie-breaking O
vote O
, O
as O
all O
Republicans B-ORG
are O
expected O
to O
vote O
against O
the O
deal O
. O
Manchin B-PER
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Jake B-PER
Tapper I-PER
on O
“State B-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Union” I-MISC
Sunday O
he O
hopes O
the O
legislation O
passes O
before O
the O
August B-MISC
recess O
. O
“I O
think O
it’s O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
legislation O
and O
on O
normal O
times O
, O
my O
Republican O
colleagues O
would O
be O
for O
something O
such O
as O
this. O

We’ve O
basically O
paid O
down O
debt O
, O
(which) O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O

We’ve O
accelerated O
permitting O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O
And O
we’ve O
increased O
production O
of O
energy O
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
want O
. O
We’ve O
done O
things O
that O
we O
should O
be O
doing O
together O

She O

previously O
raised O
concerns O

would O
raise O

Sinema B-PER

Asked O
about O
getting O
the O
support O
of O
his O
Arizona B-LOC
colleague O
, O
Manchin B-PER
said O
on O
Sunday O
, O
“ O
We O
work O
very O
close O
together O
on O
so O
many O
things O
, O
and O
she O
has O
so O
much O
in O
this O
piece O
of O
legislation O
. O
She’s O
formed O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
and O
worked O
on O
it O
very O
hard O
. O
“ O
I O
think O
that O
basically O
when O
she O
looks O
at O
the O
bill O
and O
sees O
the O
whole O
spectrum O
of O
what O
we’re O
doing O
… O
hopefully O
she O
will O
be O
positive O
about O
it O

she’ll O
make O
her O

I O

Let’s O

January O

an O

as O
FBI B-ORG

we O

the O

for O
anyone O
who O
played O
a O

January O

. O

For O
some O
people O
, O
the O
idea O
of O

a O

uncomfortable O

there’s O
no O

have O
been O
granted O

according O
to O
PolitiFact B-ORG

Those O

because O
of O
the O
severity O

some O

Sunday O
appeared O
to O
be O
holding O
almost O
24 O

The O
conflict O
led O
to O
the O
death O
of O
at O
least O
44 O
militants O
and O
civilians O
in O
Gaza, B-LOC
according O

information O

Palestinian B-ORG

Health. I-ORG

Fifteen O
of O
the O
dead O
were O
children O
. O
Israel B-LOC
insists O
most O
of O
those O
killed O
were O
militants O
, O
and O
that O
several O
civilians O
were O
killed O
by O
failed O
militant O
rocket O
launches O
. O
Hamas B-ORG
, O
the O
militant O
group O
that O
runs O
Gaza B-LOC
, O
expressed O
support O
for O
the O
PIJ’s O
actions O
. O
But O
it O
kept O
its O
much O
larger O
and O
more O
powerful O
arsenal O
of O
rockets O
out O
of O
the O
equation O
, O
while O
Israel’s B-LOC
military O
made O
it O
clear O
from O
the O
outset O
they O
were O
focusing O
solely O
on O
PIJ O
targets O
. O
That O
kept O
the O
conflict O
from O
spiraling O
into O
a O
larger O
, O
more O
dangerous O
confrontation O
, O
and O
closer O
to O
what O
happened O
during O
the O
11-day O
war O
in O
May B-MISC
2021 O
. O
So O
why O
not O
get O
involved O
? O
According O
to O
analysts O
and O
Israeli B-LOC
officials O
, O
one O
reason O
is O
the O
fact O
it O
is O
still O
only O
15 O
months O
since O
the O
2021 O
conflict O
that O
led O
to O
considerable O
damage O
and O
death O
in O
Gaza B-LOC
. O
Palestinians B-MISC
there O
are O
still O
rebuilding O
their O
homes O
, O
and O
Hamas B-ORG
is O
rebuilding O
its O
arsenal O
. O
The O
Israeli B-LOC
government O
also O
believes O
its O
campaign O
of O
economic O
incentives O
– O
boosting O
the O
number O
of O
permits O
given O
to O
Gazans B-MISC
to O
cross O
into O
Israel B-LOC
for O
work O
– O
is O
succeeding O
. O
Israel B-LOC
and O
Egypt B-LOC
have O
imposed O
a O
closure O
on O
Gaza B-LOC
since O
2007 O
, O
limiting O
access O
to O
the O
territory O
via O
land O
, O
air O
and O
sea O
, O
including O
tight O
restrictions O
on O
the O
movement O
of O
residents O
and O
the O
flow O
of O
goods O
. O
If O
rockets O
are O
fired O
, O
Israel B-LOC
closes O
the O
border O
and O
the O
thousands O
of O
Gazans B-MISC
with O
permits O
can’t O
work O
in O
Israel B-LOC
or O
get O
paid O
. O
On O
Monday B-MISC
, O
a O
senior O
Israeli B-LOC
diplomatic O
official O
said O
Hamas B-ORG
was O
“ O

The O
conflict O
also O
brought O
about O
another O
breakthrough O
, O
albeit O
on O
a O
somewhat O
smaller O
scale O
: O
former O
prime O

now O

met O
with O
Lapid B-PER
on O
Sunday O

It O
was O

nearly O
half O

The O
August B-MISC

Fire I-MISC
was O
originally O
more O
than O
three O
dozen O

Those O

merged O
to O

, O
burning O
more O
than O
a O
million O

were O
exhausted O
that O

about O
the O

more O

sparked O
by O
dry O

. O
All O
of O
the O
seven O

have O
occurred O
in O
the O
past O
five O
years O

four O

it O

Dry O

frequently O
in O
July B-LOC

August B-LOC
, O
the O

later O
in O
September B-LOC

“ O
That O
is O
a O
lot O

are O
usually O
more O

Vagasky B-PER
, O
who O

This O
really O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O

when O
dry O

can O
be O
expected O
so O
that O

can O
be O
at O

whether O

occur O
more O

one O
thing O
is O
certain O
, O
he O
said O
, O
as O
the O
Western B-LOC
drought O
persists O
, O
conditions O
are O
much O
more O
favorable O
for O

to O
take O
shape O
. O
In O
just O
the O
last O

alone O
, O
dry O

has O
sparked O
deadly O

destructive O
wildfires O
such O
as O
the O

burned O
more O

“ O
So O
we O
can O
say O
that O
no O

what O
the O

is O
doing O

when O
lightning O
happens O
with O
a O
hotter O

it’s O
just O
going O

that O

More O
immediately O
, O
the O

could O
also O
be O
the O
curtain O

to O
what O
may O
well O

critical O
legal O

over O
the O
extent O

which O

assert O
executive O

Such O
a O

could O
go O
all O

the O
Supreme B-ORG

break O

the O

more O
broadly O

the O

the O

recommends O

decide O

the O
EPA B-ORG
urges O

remove O
any O

that O
may O
need O
to O
be O
recycled O
separately O
. O
The O
agency O
says O
that O
recycling O
one O

saves O
the O
energy O
equivalent O
of O
the O
electricity O
used O
by O
more O
than O
3,500 O
US B-LOC
homes O
in O
a O
year O
. O
For O
every O
one O
million O
cell O

that O
are O
recycled O
, O
the O
agency O
says O
35,000 O
pounds O
of O
copper O
, O
772 O
pounds O
of O
silver O
, O
75 O
pounds O
of O

Apart O
from O
these O
options O
, O
Seibert B-PER
simply O
urges O
consumers O
to O
start O
thinking O
about O
electronics O
like O
we O
think O
about O

: O
we O
don’t O
trash O
our O

when O
we O
need O
new O

or O
if O
the O

cracks O
. O

Everybody O
wants O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
Seibert B-PER
said O
. O

So O
we’ve O
got O
to O
give O
them O
the O
resources O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
, O
and O
that’s O
still O
a O
work O

Going O

As O

O O
That O

an O

” O
Wellesley B-PER
said O
. O
Then O
there O
is O
the O
issue O
of O

it O

Some O

warn O

down O
, O
we O
will O
see O

. O
And O
while O
the O
main O
concern O
has O
rested O
on O
grain O

, O
some O
worry O
that O
the O

of O
rice O
, O

cornerstone O
of O
many O

in O
Asia B-LOC

could O
take O

Even O
if O
there O
are O
currently O
high O
inventories O
of O
rice O
, O
protectionism O
and O
people O
turning O
to O
rice O
as O
a O
substitute O
for O

could O
impact O

. O
“Sub-Saharan B-LOC

Monkeypox B-MISC
is O
a O
poxvirus O
, O
related O
to O
smallpox B-MISC

it O
generally O
causes O
pimple- O

flu-like O
symptoms O
such O

according O
to O
the O

The O
lesions O
typically O
concentrate O
on O
the O
arms O

but O
in O
the O
latest O
outbreak O
, O
they’re O
showing O
up O
more O
frequently O
on O
the O
genital O

perianal O
area O
, O
which O
has O
raised O
some O
concerns O
that O
monkeypox O
lesions O
may O
be O
confused O
with O
STDs B-MISC

“ O
I O
had O
between O
600 O
to O
800 O
lesions O
all O
over O
my O

It O
was O
like O
someone O

bonus O

moment O

more O
importantly O
, O
the O
strike O
backs O
up O
Biden B-PER
’ O

claim O
to O
be O
able O
to O
target O
US B-ORG
enemies O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
from O
“ O
over O
the O
horizon O

– O
part O

argument O
that O

no O

needs O
to O
maintain O
large O
land O
armies O
on O
foreign O
battlefields O

While O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
unable O
to O
reconstitute O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
after O
the O
death O
of O
bin O
Laden B-PER
to O
its O
former O
power O
, O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
death O
stand O
as O
a O
warning O
to O
other O
terrorist O
groups O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
and O
elsewhere O
. O
However O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
apparently O
killed O
in O
an O
attack O
on O
a O
house O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Kabul B-LOC
raises O
real O
concerns O
that O
Afghanistan B-LOC
– O
back O
under O
Taliban B-ORG
control O
– O
is O
yet O
again O
harboring O
al O
Qaeda B-ORG
. O
But O
it O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
US B-ORG
has O
intelligence O
capabilities O
in O
Afghanistan B-LOC
despite O
the O
exit O
of O
US B-ORG
diplomats O
, O
military O
and O
intelligence O
officials O
from O
the O
country O
last O
year O
. O

Biden B-PER
chose O
the O
more O
optimistic O
takeaway O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
operation O
proved O
his O
promise O
that O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
Afghanistan B-LOC
to O
again O
become O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
terrorists O
. O
Presidents O
typically O
don’t O
take O
life-and-death O
decisions O
about O
national O
security O
to O
massage O
their O
own O
approval O
ratings O
– O
at O
least O
most O
of O
them O
don’t O
. O
But O
they O
all O
operate O
in O
a O
political O
context O
because O
of O
their O
position O
. O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
Biden B-PER
could O
benefit O
incrementally O
from O
his O
commander-in-chief O
moment O
on O
television O
, O
reporting O
from O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
to O
Americans O
about O
the O
killing O
of O
an O
enemy O
. O
The O
drone O
strike O
in O
Kabul B-LOC
came O
as O
Biden B-PER
was O
being O
assailed O
by O
Republicans B-ORG
as O
weak O
and O
incapable O
. O
During O
the O
US B-ORG
departure O
from O
Afghanistan B-LOC
, O
Biden’s B-PER
reputation O
as O
a O
safe O
pair O
of O
hands O
on O
foreign O
policy O
took O
a O
hit O
as O
Americans O
watched O
scenes O
of O
desperate O
refugees O
falling O
to O
their O
deaths O
from O
departing O
US B-ORG
planes O
, O
and O
the O
US B-ORG
military O
admitted O
to O
a O
botched O
drone O
strike O
that O
killed O
10 O
Afghan B-MISC
civilians O
– O
including O
seven O
children O
. O
But O
it’s O
also O
unlikely O
that O
Monday’s O
news O
will O
do O
much O
to O
alter O
the O
fate O
of O
Democrats B-ORG
in O
November’s O
midterm O
elections O
, O
who O
fear O
heavy O
losses O
amid O
new O
signs O
the O
economy O
could O
plunge O
into O
recession O
and O
following O
months O
of O
punishing O
high O
inflation O
. O
Foreign O
policy O
victories O
can O
be O
fleeting O
, O
and O
decapitating O
terror O
groups O
no O
longer O
brings O
the O
political O
payoff O
that O
it O
did O
when O
then-President O
George B-PER
W I-PER
. O

Bush O
was O
keeping O
score O
in O
the O
years O
after O
9/11 O
. O
It O
may O
take O
a O
few O
days O
to O
fully O
assess O
how O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
located O
and O
to O
confirm O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
versions O
of O
events O
. O

On O
occasion O
, O
administrations O
have O
gotten O
details O
wrong O
or O
out O
of O
context O
in O
early O
readouts O
. O
Biden B-PER
’s O
assurance O
that O
no O
civilians O
were O
killed O
in O
the O
drone O
strike O
could O
not O
immediately O
be O
confirmed O
. O
In O
an O
increasingly O
polarized O
nation O
, O
the O
killing O
could O
offer O
a O
rare O
moment O
of O
unity O
– O
even O
if O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
9/11 O
attacks O
and O
the O
relatively O
low O
profile O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
didn’t O
send O
crowds O
to O
chant O
outside O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
as O
was O
the O
case O
when O
bin O
Laden B-PER
was O
killed O
. O
Still O
, O
any O
satisfaction O
over O
the O
killing O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
is O
likely O
to O
be O
soon O
overtaken O
by O
a O
more O
multilayered O
and O
urgent O
US B-ORG
conundrum O
abroad O
– O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
standoff O
over O
Taiwan B-LOC
that O
threatens O
to O
erupt O
even O
as O
the O
US B-ORG
wages O
an O
effective O
proxy O
war O
against O
Russia B-LOC
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O
US B-ORG
and O
Taiwanese B-LOC
officials O
have O
said O
that O
House B-ORG
Speaker O
Nancy B-PER
Pelosi I-PER
is O
expected O
to O
defy O
increasingly O
irate O
warnings O
in O
Beijing B-LOC
and O
fly O

. O
Some O
foreign O
policy O
experts O
fear O
the O
trip O
could O
provoke O
an O
unprecedented O
Chinese B-MISC
response O
. O

Presidents O
know O
only O
too O
well O
that O
when O
one O
national O
security O

is O
extinguished O
, O
the O
next O
is O
just O

passion O

even O
more O
salient O
today O

Gun O
control O

remains O
minimal O

though O
, O
crucially O

just O
last O

President O

signed O
into O

the O
Bipartisan B-MISC
Safer I-MISC

Act I-MISC
, O
the O
first O
significant O
federal O
gun O
safety O
legislation O
passed O
in O
nearly O
30 O
years O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
some O
Democratic-controlled O
state O
legislatures O
are O
designing O
laws O
to O
confront O
the O
recent O
spike O
in O
gun O

. O

However O
, O
some O
observers O
worry O
about O
the O
potential O
unintended O
consequences O
of O
such O
laws O

which O
have O
at O
times O

the O

“ O
There’s O
definitely O
a O
tension O
between O

of O

policies O
we’ve O
seen O
implemented O
over O
the O

, O
Jackson B-PER
told O

“ O
That’s O
why O
we’re O
pushing O
for O
a O
public-health O
response O
to O
gun O
violence O
, O
which O
means O
that O
it O
should O
be O
people O
centered O
and O
resource O
driven O
, O
not O
necessarily O
about O
carceral O
strategies O
or O
restrictive O
policies O

In O
short O
, O
he O
wants O

to O
play O
a O
smaller O
role O
in O

Jackson B-PER
added O
that O
he O
has O
little O
interest O

directing O
resentment O
toward O
the O

who O
shot O
him O

What O
I O
have O
more O
resentment O
for O
is O
, O
How O
did O
that O
individual O
gain O
access O

the O

Why O
is O
it O
so O
easy O
for O
people O
in O
my O

to O
get O
a O
gun O
? O
It’s O
easier O
to O
get O
a O

it O
is O
to O
get O
a O
library O

a O
healthy O
meal O

Jackson B-PER
said O
. O
There’s O
no O
easy O
way O
to O
curb O
gun O
violence O

experts O
say O
that O
“cleaning O
up O

shrinking O
our O

important O

some O

echoed O
some O
of O

sentiments O

“ O
What O
we’re O

is O
an O

these O

Mitchell B-PER
told O

stressing O
that O
“ O
the O

” O
He O
also O
noted O
that O
his O
view O
puts O
him O
in O
an O
uncomfortable O
position O
, O
because O
he’s O
“ O
not O
a O

” O
and O
doesn’t O
own O
a O

. O
Like O
Anderson B-PER

Kaishian B-PER
, O
Mitchell B-PER
pointed O
out O
the O
challenge O
that O
policing O
can O
pose O
. O
“ O
What O
we’re O
seeing O
is O
the O
police O
saying O
, O
Listen O
, O
if O
we O
can’t O
stop O
gun O

, O
then O
we O
just O
need O
to O
arrest O

many O

possible O
and O
hope O
that O
that O
has O
some O
type O
of O
effect O

” O
Mitchell B-PER
said O
. O
“ O
Also O
, O
there O
are O
PR B-MISC
benefits O
to O
being O
able O
to O
say O
, O
We O
pulled O
14,000 O

especially O
when O
the O
manufacturers O
of O

enjoy O
such O
broad O
immunity O
from O

? O
For O
starters O
, O
we O
must O
recognize O
that O
while O
even O
well-intentioned O

can O
disproportionately O
harm O
Black B-MISC

, O
there’s O
a O
flip O

“ O
It’s O

Much O
evidence O

that O

actually O
stop O

that O

a O

Scotching O
false O

matters O

too O

, O
Republican B-MISC

often O
attempt O

the O

we O

something O

the O

“ O

on O

out O

has O
refused O

one O

the O

giving O

reason O

believe O
they O
could O
convince O

change O

Democrats B-ORG
are O
still O
confident O
that O
they O

also O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
may O
have O
to O
make O
some O
changes O
– O
particularly O
over O
the O

to O
get O

as O
she O

been O
in O

So O
you O

I O

she’s O
going O
through O

right O

At O
a O

On O
Wednesday O

“ O
Taking O
my O

the O

last O
fall O
, O
Sinema B-PER
indicated O
her O
support O
for O
a O

saying O
at O
the O
time O
that O
it’s O
a O

ensure O

The O

Seiden B-PER
expressed O
the O
business O
community’s O
opposition O
to O
the O
15% O
tax O
provision O
, O
noting O
it O
would O
particularly O
hit O

that O
take O
advantage O
of O
an O
accelerated O

deduction O
that O
lowers O
their O

asked O

more O

asked O
that O

him O

that O

somehow O
amending O

It O

a O

“ O

with O

” O
While O
Democrats O
say O
the O

would O
ensure O
large O

don’t O
avoid O
paying O
taxes O
, O
instilling O
“ O
fairness O
” O
into O
the O
tax O
code O
, O
the O
Arizona B-LOC
Chamber I-ORG
president O
argued O
that O
a O
minimum O
corporate O
tax O
makes O
the O
code O
“ O
overly O
complicated O
.” O
Seiden B-PER
said O
that O
raising O
taxes O
during O
a O
recession O
is O
particularly O
unpopular O
and O
would O
inject O
more O
uncertainty O
into O
the O

said O
the O
“ O
the O

if O

Seiden B-PER

see O
some O

the O

environmental O
pieces O
go O
through O
without O
the O
“poison O

acknowledging O
that O
some O
elements O

support O
provisions O

In O

the O
Arizona B-LOC
Chamber B-ORG

“I O

“You O

Sinema B-PER
said. O
“That O
was O
true O
yesterday O

it O

today.” O
Sinema B-PER

effectively O
pushed O

John B-PER

death O
at O
the O
hands O

raised O
questions O
about O
who O
will O
replace O
him O
as O
the O
leader O

While O

Here’s O
what O
we O
know O
about O
who O
could O
be O
the O
next O
Al B-ORG

leader O
. O
The O
longtime O
insider O
The O
man O
tipped O
by O
many O
analysts O
to O
be O
Zawahiri’s B-PER
successor O
is O
Saif B-PER
al-Adel I-PER
, O
a O
former O
Egyptian B-LOC
commando O
who O
is O
one O
of O
the O
last O
survivors O
of O
al B-ORG

“founding O
generation” O
and O
has O
spent O
much O
of O
the O
past O
two O
decades O
in O
Iran B-LOC
. O
Adel B-PER
was O
a O
loyal O
servant O
to O
Osama B-PER
bin I-PER
Laden I-PER
before O
acting O
as O
al B-ORG
Qaeda’s I-ORG
interim O
leader O
in O
2011 O
. O
He O
organized O
the O
succession O
process O
in O
favor O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
because O
that O
was O
bin O
Laden’s O
wish O
– O
even O
though O
Adel B-PER
himself O
might O
have O
been O
a O
more O
effective O
choice O
as O
competition O
from O
ISIS B-ORG
grew O
in O
the O
following O
years O
. O
Saif B-PER
al-Adel I-PER
is O
his O
nom O
de O
guerre O
, O
which O
translates O
as O
Sword B-MISC

It’s O
not O
the O

There O
are O

faked O
his O
death O
in O
his O
20s O

His O
status O
in O

also O

it O

Shabaab B-ORG

Diriye B-PER
was O
quick O
to O
pledge O
allegiance O
to O

when O

became O

. O
For O
al B-ORG

, O
the O
appointment O
of O
a O
leader O
from O

would O
be O
a O
cultural O
leap O

Some O
former O
al B-ORG

insiders O
say O
that O
senior O
Egyptian B-LOC

down O

council O

, O
which O
had O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
election O
of O
Zawahiri B-PER
, O
is O
hard O
to O
discern O
. O
When O
Zawahiri B-PER
was O
selected O
, O
he O
had O
already O
been O
anointed O
by O
bin B-PER
Laden I-PER
as O
his O
successor O
but O
it O
still O
took O
some O
time O
to O
garner O
the O
“bayat” O
– O
the O
oath O
of O
loyalty O
– O
of O
far-flung O
members O
of O
the O
council O
. O
The O
working O
assumption O
among O
analysts O
is O
that O
members O
of O
the O
Shura B-MISC
may O
over O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
begin O
to O
declare O
bayat O
to O
al B-ORG

third O
leader O

But O
the O
field O
of O
possible O
contenders O
has O
been O
whittled O
down O
over O
the O
years O

especially O
with O
the O
deaths O
of O

son O
Hamza B-PER

the O

Can O

? O
However O
, O
there O
may O
be O
opportunities O
for O
al B-ORG

whether O

the O

typically O
forthcoming O
about O
the O
companies O
that O

And O
manufacturers O
, O
likewise O

have O
little O

reveal O

similar O

Many O
leading O

create O

for O
multiple O
retailers O
. O
In O
the O
late O
1990s O
more O
than O
half O
of O
brand O
manufacturers O
were O
estimated O
to O
make O
private O
goods O
as O
well O
. O
Although O
store O
brands O
ostensibly O
compete O
with O
manufacturers’ O
national O
brands O
, O
manufacturers O
often O
have O
excess O
capacity O
on O
their O
production O
lines O
. O
To O
generate O
additional O
profit O
, O
some O
will O
use O
that O
extra O
capacity O
to O
make O
private O
labels O
. O
Other O
brand O
manufacturers O
will O
produce O
private O
labels O
as O
an O
incentive O
for O
retailers O
, O
hoping O
they’ll O
be O
rewarded O
with O
better O

These O

were O
the O

These O

flooded O
the O
airwaves O

with O
advertisements O
extolling O
the O
advantages O
of O
their O
products O
. O

Most O
customers O
were O
fiercely O
loyal O
to O
specific O
brands O
, O
not O
retailers O
. O
A O
store O
that O
didn’t O
carry O
major O
labels O
would O
likely O
get O
crushed O
, O
which O
gave O
manufacturers O
immense O
leverage O

Additionally O
, O
many O

were O
also O
considered O
dull O

cheap O
knockoffs O
of O

. O
The O
low O
point O
of O
private O
label O
came O
during O
the O
1970s O
, O
Durham B-PER
said O
, O
when O
stores O
seeking O
to O
cut O
costs O
and O
rolled O
out O
generics O
with O
basic O
white O
backgrounds O
and O
black O
letters O

Retailers O
make O
private O
label O
brands O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
, O
including O
to O
boost O
profitability O
and O
sometimes O
as O
a O
negotiating O
tool O
against O
brands O
. O
Private O
brands O
often O
carry O
profit O
margins O
that O
are O
20% O
to O
40% O
higher O
than O
national O
brands O
because O
stores O
don’t O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
advertising O
, O
distribution O
or O
other O
markup O
costs O
that O
are O
embedded O
in O
major O
brands’ O
prices O
. O
In O
the O
mid-20th O
century O
, O
many O
retailers O
started O
to O
develop O
their O
own O
labels O
to O
claw O
back O

power O

keep O
their O

As O
the O

has O
consolidated O
in O
recent O
decades O

the O
power O

between O

Now O
, O

The O

both O
McMichaels B-PER
did O
not O
have O
the O
funds O
to O
pay O
a O
fine O
. O

The O

noted O
that O
Bryan B-PER
, O
who O
recorded O
the O

and O
notified O

the O

, O
should O
be O
distinguished O
from O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
. O
Bryan B-PER
was O
not O
armed O
while O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
were O
. O
“ O
To O
give O
you O
a O
life O
sentence O
would O
be O
to O
not O
distinguish O
you O
at O
all O
from O
the O
McMichaels B-PER
, O
” O
she O
said O
, O
adding O
that O
Bryan B-PER
still O
deserved O
a O
long O
sentence O
. O
She O
noted O
he O
would O
be O
90 O
when O
his O
federal O
sentence O
ends O
. O
The O
sentencing O
of O
both O
McMichaels B-PER
were O
preceded O
by O
emotional O
testimony O
from O
Arbery’s B-PER
family O
, O
which O
told O
the O
court O
about O
how O
his O
killing O
had O
impacted O
them O
and O
changed O
their O
family O
. O
They O
also O
condemned O
the O
actions O
of O
both O
men O
, O
with O
Cooper-Jones B-PER
testifying O
to O
her O
confusion O
when O
she O
learned O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
was O
with O
Travis B-PER
he O
killed O
Arbery B-PER
. O
At O
first O
, O
she O
said O
, O
she O
questioned O
whether O
that O
could O
be O
true O
. O
“ O
I O
struggled O
to O
come O
to O
the O
realization O
that O
a O
father O
would O
actually O
accompany O
his O
son O
to O
take O
a O
life O
, O
” O
she O
said O
. O
“ O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
believe O
that O
, O
because O
me O
as O
a O
mother O
, O
I O
could O
never O
accompany O
my O
son O
to O
do O
any O
type O
of O
crime O
. O
Before O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
was O
sentenced O
, O
he O
acknowledged O
Arbery’s B-PER
family O
, O
who O
were O
in O
court O
, O
saying O
the O
“ O
loss O
that O
you’ve O
endured O
is O
beyond O
description O
. O
There’s O
no O
words O
for O
it O
.” O
“ O
I’m O
sure O
that O
my O
words O
mean O
little O
to O
you O
, O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
assure O
you O
I O
never O
wanted O
any O
of O
this O
to O
happen O
. O
There O
was O
no O
malice O
in O
my O
heart O
or O
my O
son’s O
heart O
that O
day O
, O
” O
he O
said O
. O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
also O
apologized O
to O
his O
wife O
and O
his O
son O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
I O
should O
have O
never O
put O
him O
in O
that O
situation O
.” O
“ O
Finally O
, O
I O
pray O
that O
God’s O
peace O
will O
come O
to O
the O
Arbery B-PER
family O
and O
this O
community O
, O
” O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael I-PER
said O
. O
Cooper-Jones B-PER
told O
CNN’s B-ORG
Sara B-PER
Sidner I-PER
that O
while O
she O
accepted O
the O
apology O
, O
“ O
I O
did O
not O
forgive O
him O
for O
what O
he O
did O
.” O
She O
said O
she O
thought O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
to O
think O
about O
while O
he’s O
been O
in O
jail O
for O
the O
past O
two-plus O
years O
. O

He’s O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
he O
made O
a O
very O
bad O
decision O
, O
and O
he O
wanted O
to O
say O
he O
was O
sorry O
, O
” O
she O
told O
CNN B-ORG
. O
“ O
So O
I O
did O
accept O
it O
, O
but O
as O
far O
as O
forgiving O
, O
I O
haven’t O
forgave O
him O
. O
Bryan B-PER
later O
issued O
a O
similar O
apology O
, O
but O
Arbery’s B-PER
father O
, O
Marcus B-PER
Arbery I-PER
Sr. O
, O
dismissed O
Bryan’s B-PER
words O
. O
“ O
When O
this O
first O
happened O
, O
he O
should O
have O
shown O
some O
kind O
of O
remorse O
then O
, O
Arbery B-PER
said O
. O
” O

When O
you O
get O
caught O
up O
and O
it’s O
looking O
bad O
for O
you O
, O
that’s O
when O
you’re O
trying O
to O
apologize O
. O

That’s O
a O
bad O
time O
to O
apologize O
. O
He O
should O
have O
did O
that O
day O
one O
.” O
Attorney O
Ben B-PER
Crump I-PER
, O
who O
represents O
the O
Arbery B-PER
family O
, O
said O
he O
hopes O
it O
is O
a O
“ O
turning O
point O
in O
the O
civil O
rights O
movement O
.” O
“ O
This O
sentence O
sends O
a O

denies O
McMichaels’ B-PER

killing O
, O
months O
before O
the O
police O
killing O
of O
George B-PER
Floyd I-PER
in O
Minneapolis B-LOC
, O
was O
in O
some O
ways O
a O
harbinger O
of O
the O
nationwide O
protests O
that O
erupted O
that O

decried O

Travis B-PER

Copeland B-PER
said O
, O
telling O
the O

his O

” O
of O
threats O
. O
Forcing O
him O
to O
serve O
the O
time O
in O
a O
Georgia B-LOC
state O
prison O
would O
essentially O
amount O
to O
a O
“ O
backdoor O
death O
penalty O
” O
that O
could O
leave O
McMichael B-PER
vulnerable O
to O
“ O
vigilante O
justice O
,” O
she O
argued O
, O
acknowledging O
the O
“ O
rich O
irony O
.” O
Gregory B-PER
McMichael’s I-PER
attorney O
made O
a O
similar O
request O
, O
but O
argued O
the O
66-year-old O
should O
be O
kept O
in O
federal O
custody O
for O
his O
health O
. O
Prosecutors O
opposed O
both O

In O
cases O

the O

their O

, O
using O

Prosecutors O

Arbery’s B-PER

Defense O

McMichaels B-PER
pursued O
Arbery B-PER
in O
a O
pickup O
through O
neighborhood O
streets O
to O
stop O
him O

the O
past O

he O
never O
took O
anything O

The O
defense O
also O
argued O

self-defense O

But O
other O

say O
the O
loss O
of O

if O
the O

only O

cast O
him O

“What O
