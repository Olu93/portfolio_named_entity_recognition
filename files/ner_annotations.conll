Blinken I-PER
criticized O
the O
Russian B-LOC
legal O
system O
more O
broadly O
, O
saying O
the O
sentence O
“ O
puts O
a O
spotlight O
on O
our O
significant O
concerns O
with O
Russia’s B-LOC
legal O
system O
and O
the O
Russian B-LOC
government’s O
use O
of O
wrongful O
detentions O
to O
advance O
its O
own O
agenda O
, O
using O
individuals O
as O
political O
pawns O
.” O

He O
said O
the O
US B-ORG
is O
working O
to O
bring O
home O
Griner B-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
Whelan I-PER
, O
an O
American O
citizen O
who O
has O
been O
held O
by O
Russia B-LOC
for O
alleged O
espionage O
since O
2018 O
. O

This O
is O
an O
absolute O
priority O
of O
mine O
and O
the O
Department’s O
,” O
Blinken B-PER
said O

It’s O
now O
“up O
to O
the O
Russian B-LOC
side” O
on O
whether O
Griner’s O
conviction O
opens O
new O
doors O
for O
negotiations O
of O
a O
prisoner O
swap, O
National B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Council I-ORG
spokesperson O
John B-PER
Kirby I-PER
said. O

We’re O
still O
open O
to O
having O
our O
proposal O
seriously O
and O
positively O
considered O
, O
and O
if O
on O
the O
Russian B-LOC
side O
that O
means O
they O
feel O
like O
they’re O
more O
empowered O
to O
do O
that O
, O
then O
so O
be O
it O
, O
Kirby B-PER
told O
reporters O
in O
Thursday’s O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
briefing O
. O

Kirby B-PER
reiterated O
the O
US O
position O
remains O
that O
it O
wants O
Russia B-LOC
to O
“take O
the O
deal O
on O
the O
table O
because O
it’s O
a O
good O
one O
, O
it’s O
a O
fair O
one O
, O
and O
it’ll O
help O
bring O
Paul B-PER

Brittney B-PER
home O
. O

CNN B-ORG
National O

Analyst O
Steve B-PER
Hall I-PER
said O
the O
harsh O
sentence O
was O
not O
a O
surprise O
and O
argued O
that O
Russia’s B-LOC
court O
proceedings O
are O
not O
legitimate O
. O

This O
is O
all O
performance O
in O
Russia B-LOC
. O

There O
was O
never O
any O
doubt O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
,” O
he O
said O

“ O

What O
Vladimir B-PER
Putin I-PER
is O
trying O
to O
do O
is O
basically O
drive O
up O
the O
bargaining O
price O
of O
Ms. O
Griner B-PER
. O

Last O
week O
, O
CNN B-ORG
reported O
that O
the O

Viktor B-PER

Russian B-LOC
officials O
countered O
the O
US B-ORG
offer O
, O
multiple O
sources O
familiar O
with O
the O
discussions O
have O
said O
, O
but O
US B-ORG

did O
not O
accept O
the O
request O
as O
a O
legitimate O
counteroffer O

The O
Kremlin B-LOC

Tuesday O
that O
US O
“megaphone O

after O
the O

the O
verdict O
was O
devastating O
. O

Nobody O
wanted O
to O
even O
play O
today O
,” O
she O
told O
reporters O

“ O

How O
are O
you O
supposed O
to O
approach O
the O
game O
, O
approach O
the O
court O
and O
with O
a O
clear O
mind O
, O
and O
our O
whole O

is O
crying O
before O
the O

Because O
you O
try O
to O
honor O
her O
and O
you O
try O
to O
come O
out O
and O
still O
play O
hard O
for O
her O

Earlier, O
the O
Mercury B-ORG
released O
a O
statement O
calling O
the O
verdict O
“ O
a O
sobering O
milestone O
in O
the O
168-day O
nightmare” O
of O
her O
detention. O

We O
are O
inspired O
every O
day O
by O
BG’s O
strength O
and O
we O
are O
steadfastly O
committed O
to O
keeping O
her O
top-of-mind O
publicly O
until O
she O
is O
safely O
back O
on O
American B-LOC

We O
will O
not O

the O

Head O

Vanessa B-PER
Nygaard I-PER
told O
CNN B-ORG
the O
guilty O
verdict O
and O
Griner’s O
sentence O
is O
“unacceptable.” O

It’s O
just O
heartbreaking O
the O
coach O
said O
.” O

To O
hear O
her O
words O
and O
her O
apologies O
. O

Just O
trying O
to O
send O
love O
, O
prayers O
and O
strength O
to O
her O
. O

In O
a O
joint O
statement O
, O
WNBA O
Commissioner O
Cathy B-PER
Engelbert I-PER
and O
NBA O
Commissioner O
Adam B-PER
Silver I-PER
criticized O
the O
verdict O
and O
sentence O
as O
“unjustified O
and O
unfortunate O
, O
but O
not O
unexpected O
. O

The O
WNBA B-ORG
and O
NBA’s B-ORG
commitment O
to O
her O
safe O
return O
has O
not O
wavered O
and O
it O
is O
our O
hope O
that O
we O
are O
near O
the O
end O
of O
this O
process O
of O
finally O
bringing O
BG O
home O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
,” O
they O
said O

Defense O
asked O
for O
leniency O
in O
closing O
arguments O
The O
court O
hearing O
Thursday O
began O
shortly O
after O
Griner B-PER
arrived O
in O
handcuffs O
, O
escorted O
by O
Russian B-LOC
officers O
into O
the O
defendant’s O
cage O

Once O
uncuffed O
, O
she O
spoke O
with O
her O
legal O
team O
and O
then O
held O
up O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
UMMC B-ORG
Ekaterinburg B-LOC
basketball O
team O
, O
the O
Russian B-LOC
squad O
she O
played O
for O
during O
the O
WNBA O
offseason O
. O

In O
closing O
arguments O
, O
Blagovolina B-PER
argued O
that O
Griner B-PER
never O
used O
marijuana O
in O
Russia B-LOC
and O
that O
she O
never O
had O
the O
intention O
of O
doing O
so O
. O

She O
had O
no O
need O
to O
bring O
the O
vape O
cartridges O
to O
Russia B-LOC
, O
the O
lawyer O
added O
. O

All O
this O
confirms O
the O
complete O
absence O
of O
intent O
in O
her O
actions O
, O
Blagovolina B-PER
argued O
. O

Even O
if O
Griner O
ever O
used O
medical O
marijuana O
, O
it O
was O
only O
at O
home O
back O
in O
Arizona B-LOC
, O
rare O
and O
only O
with O
a O
doctor’s O
prescription O
, O
she O
added O
. O

She O
couldn’t O
have O
known O
how O
strict O
the O
laws O
were O
in O
Russia B-LOC
, O
Blagovolina B-PER
said O
. O

Boykov B-PER
also O
argued O
Griner B-PER
had O
no O
opportunity O
to O
properly O
examine O
the O
court O
documents O

He O
said O
that O
the O
Russian B-LOC
constitution O
guarantees O
everyone O
the O
right O
to O
use O
their O
native O
language O
and O
the O
free O
choice O
of O
the O
language O
of O
communication O

Boykov B-PER
cited O
an O
instance O
when O
a O
language O
interpreter O
provided O
to O
Griner B-PER
flipped O
through O
a O
lengthy O
document O
offered O
by O
an O
investigator O
for O
translation O
and O
then O
told O
Griner B-PER
, O
“ O
Basically O
, O
it O
means O
that O
you O
are O
guilty O
. O
” O

Throughout O
the O
trial O
, O
Griner’s O
attorneys O
have O
laid O
out O
arguments O
undermining O
the O
prosecution’s O
case O
and O
claiming O
her O
detention O
was O
not O
handled O
correctly O
after O
she O
was O
stopped O
February O
17 O
by O
personnel O
at O
the O
Sheremetyevo B-LOC
International I-LOC
Airport I-LOC
. O

Her O
detention O
, O
search O
and O
arrest O
were O
“improper,” O
Boykov B-PER
said O
last O
week O
, O
noting O
more O
details O
would O
be O
revealed O
during O
closing O
arguments O
. O
